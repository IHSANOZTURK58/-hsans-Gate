        "<h3>A Scandal in Bohemia</h3>\n<p>I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA</p>\n<p>I.</p>\n<p>To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him</p>\n<p>mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and</p>\n<p>predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion</p>\n<p>akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,</p>",
        "<p>were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He</p>\n<p>was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that</p>\n<p>the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a</p>\n<p>false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe</p>\n<p>and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for</p>\n<p>drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained</p>\n<p>reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely</p>",
        "<p>adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might</p>\n<p>throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive</p>\n<p>instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not</p>\n<p>be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And</p>\n<p>yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene</p>\n<p>Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.</p>\n<p>I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away</p>",
        "<p>from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p>\n<p>interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master</p>\n<p>of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,</p>\n<p>while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian</p>\n<p>soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old</p>\n<p>books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,</p>\n<p>the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen</p>",
        "<p>nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,</p>\n<p>and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of</p>\n<p>observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those</p>\n<p>mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.</p>\n<p>From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his</p>\n<p>summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up</p>\n<p>of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and</p>",
        "<p>finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and</p>\n<p>successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of</p>\n<p>his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of</p>\n<p>the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.</p>\n<p>One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a</p>\n<p>journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when</p>\n<p>my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered</p>",
        "<p>door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and</p>\n<p>with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a</p>\n<p>keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his</p>\n<p>extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I</p>\n<p>looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette</p>\n<p>against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his</p>\n<p>head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who</p>",
        "<p>knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own</p>\n<p>story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created</p>\n<p>dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell</p>\n<p>and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.</p>\n<p>His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,</p>\n<p>to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved</p>\n<p>me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p>",
        "<p>spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire</p>\n<p>and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.</p>\n<p>“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put</p>\n<p>on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”</p>\n<p>“Seven!” I answered.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I</p>\n<p>fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me</p>",
        "<p>that you intended to go into harness.”</p>\n<p>“Then, how do you know?”</p>\n<p>“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting</p>\n<p>yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless</p>\n<p>servant girl?”</p>\n<p>“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have</p>\n<p>been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a</p>",
        "<p>country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I</p>\n<p>have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary</p>\n<p>Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,</p>\n<p>again, I fail to see how you work it out.”</p>\n<p>He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.</p>\n<p>“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside</p>\n<p>of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is</p>",
        "<p>scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by</p>\n<p>someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in</p>\n<p>order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double</p>\n<p>deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a</p>\n<p>particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As</p>\n<p>to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of</p>\n<p>iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right</p>",
        "<p>forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where</p>\n<p>he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not</p>\n<p>pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”</p>\n<p>I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his</p>\n<p>process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,</p>\n<p>“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I</p>\n<p>could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your</p>",
        "<p>reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I</p>\n<p>believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself</p>\n<p>down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The</p>\n<p>distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps</p>\n<p>which lead up from the hall to this room.”</p>\n<p>“Frequently.”</p>",
        "<p>“How often?”</p>\n<p>“Well, some hundreds of times.”</p>\n<p>“Then how many are there?”</p>\n<p>“How many? I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just</p>\n<p>my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have</p>\n<p>both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these</p>",
        "<p>little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two</p>\n<p>of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw</p>\n<p>over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open</p>\n<p>upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”</p>\n<p>The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</p>\n<p>“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it</p>\n<p>said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very</p>",
        "<p>deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of</p>\n<p>Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with</p>\n<p>matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.</p>\n<p>This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your</p>\n<p>chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor</p>\n<p>wear a mask.”</p>\n<p>“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it</p>",
        "<p>means?”</p>\n<p>“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has</p>\n<p>data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of</p>\n<p>theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from</p>\n<p>it?”</p>\n<p>I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was</p>\n<p>written.</p>",
        "<p>“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,</p>\n<p>endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not</p>\n<p>be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and</p>\n<p>stiff.”</p>\n<p>“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English</p>\n<p>paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”</p>\n<p>I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”</p>",
        "<p>with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.</p>\n<p>“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.</p>\n<p>“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”</p>\n<p>“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’</p>\n<p>which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like</p>\n<p>our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us</p>\n<p>glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume</p>",
        "<p>from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a</p>\n<p>German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable</p>\n<p>as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous</p>\n<p>glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of</p>\n<p>that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud</p>\n<p>from his cigarette.</p>\n<p>“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.</p>",
        "<p>“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the</p>\n<p>peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from</p>\n<p>all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written</p>\n<p>that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only</p>\n<p>remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who</p>\n<p>writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his</p>\n<p>face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our</p>",
        "<p>doubts.”</p>\n<p>As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating</p>\n<p>wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes</p>\n<p>whistled.</p>\n<p>“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of</p>\n<p>the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred</p>\n<p>and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there</p>",
        "<p>is nothing else.”</p>\n<p>“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”</p>\n<p>“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.</p>\n<p>And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”</p>\n<p>“But your client—”</p>\n<p>“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.</p>\n<p>Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”</p>",
        "<p>A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the</p>\n<p>passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and</p>\n<p>authoritative tap.</p>\n<p>“Come in!” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches</p>\n<p>in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich</p>\n<p>with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad</p>",
        "<p>taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and</p>\n<p>fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was</p>\n<p>thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and</p>\n<p>secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming</p>\n<p>beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were</p>\n<p>trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of</p>\n<p>barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He</p>",
        "<p>carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper</p>\n<p>part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard</p>\n<p>mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand</p>\n<p>was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face</p>\n<p>he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,</p>\n<p>and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length</p>\n<p>of obstinacy.</p>",
        "<p>“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly</p>\n<p>marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from</p>\n<p>one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.</p>\n<p>“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.</p>\n<p>Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom</p>\n<p>have I the honour to address?”</p>\n<p>“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I</p>",
        "<p>understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and</p>\n<p>discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme</p>\n<p>importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you</p>\n<p>alone.”</p>\n<p>I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into</p>\n<p>my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this</p>\n<p>gentleman anything which you may say to me.”</p>",
        "<p>The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,</p>\n<p>“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of</p>\n<p>that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too</p>\n<p>much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon</p>\n<p>European history.”</p>\n<p>“I promise,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“And I.”</p>",
        "<p>“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august</p>\n<p>person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may</p>\n<p>confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is</p>\n<p>not exactly my own.”</p>\n<p>“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.</p>\n<p>“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to</p>\n<p>be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and</p>",
        "<p>seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak</p>\n<p>plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary</p>\n<p>kings of Bohemia.”</p>\n<p>“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in</p>\n<p>his armchair and closing his eyes.</p>\n<p>Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,</p>\n<p>lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the</p>",
        "<p>most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes</p>\n<p>slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.</p>\n<p>“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I</p>\n<p>should be better able to advise you.”</p>\n<p>The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in</p>\n<p>uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore</p>\n<p>the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”</p>",
        "<p>he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”</p>\n<p>“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I</p>\n<p>was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von</p>\n<p>Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of</p>\n<p>Bohemia.”</p>\n<p>“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once</p>\n<p>more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can</p>",
        "<p>understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own</p>\n<p>person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to</p>\n<p>an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_</p>\n<p>from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”</p>\n<p>“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.</p>\n<p>“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy</p>\n<p>visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,</p>",
        "<p>Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”</p>\n<p>“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without</p>\n<p>opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing</p>\n<p>all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to</p>\n<p>name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish</p>\n<p>information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between</p>\n<p>that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a</p>",
        "<p>monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.</p>\n<p>“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.</p>\n<p>Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!</p>\n<p>Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your</p>\n<p>Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,</p>\n<p>wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting</p>\n<p>those letters back.”</p>",
        "<p>“Precisely so. But how—”</p>\n<p>“Was there a secret marriage?”</p>\n<p>“None.”</p>\n<p>“No legal papers or certificates?”</p>\n<p>“None.”</p>\n<p>“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should</p>\n<p>produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to</p>",
        "<p>prove their authenticity?”</p>\n<p>“There is the writing.”</p>\n<p>“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”</p>\n<p>“My private note-paper.”</p>\n<p>“Stolen.”</p>\n<p>“My own seal.”</p>\n<p>“Imitated.”</p>",
        "<p>“My photograph.”</p>\n<p>“Bought.”</p>\n<p>“We were both in the photograph.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an</p>\n<p>indiscretion.”</p>\n<p>“I was mad—insane.”</p>\n<p>“You have compromised yourself seriously.”</p>",
        "<p>“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”</p>\n<p>“It must be recovered.”</p>\n<p>“We have tried and failed.”</p>\n<p>“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”</p>\n<p>“She will not sell.”</p>\n<p>“Stolen, then.”</p>\n<p>“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her</p>",
        "<p>house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has</p>\n<p>been waylaid. There has been no result.”</p>\n<p>“No sign of it?”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely none.”</p>\n<p>Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.</p>\n<p>“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.</p>\n<p>“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”</p>",
        "<p>“To ruin me.”</p>\n<p>“But how?”</p>\n<p>“I am about to be married.”</p>\n<p>“So I have heard.”</p>\n<p>“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of</p>\n<p>Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is</p>\n<p>herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct</p>",
        "<p>would bring the matter to an end.”</p>\n<p>“And Irene Adler?”</p>\n<p>“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that</p>\n<p>she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She</p>\n<p>has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most</p>\n<p>resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no</p>\n<p>lengths to which she would not go—none.”</p>",
        "<p>“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”</p>\n<p>“I am sure.”</p>\n<p>“And why?”</p>\n<p>“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the</p>\n<p>betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is</p>\n<p>very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into</p>",
        "<p>just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the</p>\n<p>present?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count</p>\n<p>Von Kramm.”</p>\n<p>“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”</p>\n<p>“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”</p>\n<p>“Then, as to money?”</p>",
        "<p>“You have _carte blanche_.”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely?”</p>\n<p>“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to</p>\n<p>have that photograph.”</p>\n<p>“And for present expenses?”</p>\n<p>The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid</p>\n<p>it on the table.</p>",
        "<p>“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he</p>\n<p>said.</p>\n<p>Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it</p>\n<p>to him.</p>\n<p>“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”</p>\n<p>Holmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the</p>",
        "<p>photograph a cabinet?”</p>\n<p>“It was.”</p>\n<p>“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have</p>\n<p>some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the</p>\n<p>wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be</p>\n<p>good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like</p>\n<p>to chat this little matter over with you.”</p>",
        "<p>II.</p>\n<p>At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not</p>\n<p>yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house</p>\n<p>shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,</p>\n<p>however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.</p>\n<p>I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was</p>\n<p>surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were</p>",
        "<p>associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,</p>\n<p>the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a</p>\n<p>character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the</p>\n<p>investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his</p>\n<p>masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which</p>\n<p>made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the</p>\n<p>quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable</p>",
        "<p>mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very</p>\n<p>possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.</p>\n<p>It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking</p>\n<p>groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and</p>\n<p>disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my</p>\n<p>friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three</p>\n<p>times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he</p>",
        "<p>vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes</p>\n<p>tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his</p>\n<p>pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed</p>\n<p>heartily for some minutes.</p>\n<p>“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he</p>\n<p>was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>",
        "<p>“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed</p>\n<p>my morning, or what I ended by doing.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and</p>\n<p>perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.</p>\n<p>I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the</p>\n<p>character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and</p>",
        "<p>freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all</p>\n<p>that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_</p>\n<p>villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to</p>\n<p>the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on</p>\n<p>the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,</p>\n<p>and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could</p>\n<p>open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window</p>",
        "<p>could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and</p>\n<p>examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting</p>\n<p>anything else of interest.</p>\n<p>“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there</p>\n<p>was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent</p>\n<p>the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in</p>\n<p>exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,</p>",
        "<p>and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say</p>\n<p>nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was</p>\n<p>not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to</p>\n<p>listen to.”</p>\n<p>“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the</p>\n<p>daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the</p>",
        "<p>Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives</p>\n<p>out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom</p>\n<p>goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male</p>\n<p>visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,</p>\n<p>never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey</p>\n<p>Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a</p>\n<p>confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,</p>",
        "<p>and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I</p>\n<p>began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think</p>\n<p>over my plan of campaign.</p>\n<p>“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.</p>\n<p>He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between</p>\n<p>them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,</p>\n<p>his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably</p>",
        "<p>transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less</p>\n<p>likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should</p>\n<p>continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the</p>\n<p>gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it</p>\n<p>widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these</p>\n<p>details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are</p>\n<p>to understand the situation.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am following you closely,” I answered.</p>\n<p>“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up</p>\n<p>to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably</p>\n<p>handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom</p>\n<p>I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman</p>\n<p>to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of</p>\n<p>a man who was thoroughly at home.</p>",
        "<p>“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of</p>\n<p>him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking</p>\n<p>excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently</p>\n<p>he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to</p>\n<p>the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it</p>\n<p>earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &</p>\n<p>Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the</p>",
        "<p>Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’</p>\n<p>“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well</p>\n<p>to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman</p>\n<p>with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all</p>\n<p>the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t</p>\n<p>pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only</p>\n<p>caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with</p>",
        "<p>a face that a man might die for.</p>\n<p>“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if</p>\n<p>you reach it in twenty minutes.’</p>\n<p>“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether</p>\n<p>I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a</p>\n<p>cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby</p>\n<p>fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.</p>",
        "<p>Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty</p>\n<p>minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was</p>\n<p>clear enough what was in the wind.</p>\n<p>“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others</p>\n<p>were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses</p>\n<p>were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried</p>\n<p>into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had</p>",
        "<p>followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with</p>\n<p>them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I</p>\n<p>lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a</p>\n<p>church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to</p>\n<p>me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.</p>\n<p>“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’</p>\n<p>“‘What then?’ I asked.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’</p>\n<p>“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I</p>\n<p>found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and</p>\n<p>vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in</p>\n<p>the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,</p>\n<p>bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman</p>\n<p>thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the</p>",
        "<p>clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position</p>\n<p>in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it</p>\n<p>that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some</p>\n<p>informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused</p>\n<p>to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky</p>\n<p>appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the</p>\n<p>streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I</p>",
        "<p>mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”</p>\n<p>“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the</p>\n<p>pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt</p>\n<p>and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they</p>\n<p>separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I</p>\n<p>shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left</p>",
        "<p>him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I</p>\n<p>went off to make my own arrangements.”</p>\n<p>“Which are?”</p>\n<p>“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I</p>\n<p>have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still</p>\n<p>this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”</p>\n<p>“I shall be delighted.”</p>",
        "<p>“You don’t mind breaking the law?”</p>\n<p>“Not in the least.”</p>\n<p>“Nor running a chance of arrest?”</p>\n<p>“Not in a good cause.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, the cause is excellent!”</p>\n<p>“Then I am your man.”</p>\n<p>“I was sure that I might rely on you.”</p>",
        "<p>“But what is it you wish?”</p>\n<p>“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.</p>\n<p>Now,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our</p>\n<p>landlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not</p>\n<p>much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene</p>\n<p>of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at</p>\n<p>seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”</p>",
        "<p>“And what then?”</p>\n<p>“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.</p>\n<p>There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,</p>\n<p>come what may. You understand?”</p>\n<p>“I am to be neutral?”</p>\n<p>“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small</p>\n<p>unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed</p>",
        "<p>into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window</p>\n<p>will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give</p>\n<p>you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You</p>",
        "<p>quite follow me?”</p>\n<p>“Entirely.”</p>\n<p>“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped</p>\n<p>roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted</p>\n<p>with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is</p>\n<p>confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up</p>\n<p>by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the</p>",
        "<p>street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made</p>\n<p>myself clear?”</p>\n<p>“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at</p>\n<p>the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and</p>\n<p>to wait you at the corner of the street.”</p>\n<p>“Precisely.”</p>\n<p>“Then you may entirely rely on me.”</p>",
        "<p>“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare</p>\n<p>for the new role I have to play.”</p>\n<p>He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the</p>\n<p>character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His</p>\n<p>broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic</p>\n<p>smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such</p>\n<p>as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that</p>",
        "<p>Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul</p>\n<p>seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a</p>\n<p>fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a</p>\n<p>specialist in crime.</p>\n<p>It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still</p>\n<p>wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine</p>\n<p>Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as</p>",
        "<p>we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming</p>\n<p>of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be</p>\n<p>less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a</p>\n<p>quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of</p>\n<p>shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a</p>\n<p>scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a</p>",
        "<p>nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and</p>\n<p>down with cigars in their mouths.</p>\n<p>“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the</p>\n<p>house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes</p>\n<p>a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse</p>\n<p>to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming</p>\n<p>to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find</p>",
        "<p>the photograph?”</p>\n<p>“Where, indeed?”</p>\n<p>“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet</p>\n<p>size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows</p>\n<p>that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two</p>\n<p>attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that</p>\n<p>she does not carry it about with her.”</p>",
        "<p>“Where, then?”</p>\n<p>“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am</p>\n<p>inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like</p>\n<p>to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?</p>\n<p>She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what</p>\n<p>indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a</p>\n<p>business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within</p>",
        "<p>a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be</p>\n<p>in her own house.”</p>\n<p>“But it has twice been burgled.”</p>\n<p>“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”</p>\n<p>“But how will you look?”</p>\n<p>“I will not look.”</p>\n<p>“What then?”</p>",
        "<p>“I will get her to show me.”</p>\n<p>“But she will refuse.”</p>\n<p>“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her</p>\n<p>carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”</p>\n<p>As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the</p>\n<p>curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to</p>\n<p>the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at</p>",
        "<p>the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a</p>\n<p>copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with</p>\n<p>the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by</p>\n<p>the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the</p>\n<p>scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was</p>\n<p>struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,</p>\n<p>was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who</p>",
        "<p>struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes</p>\n<p>dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,</p>\n<p>he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely</p>\n<p>down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one</p>\n<p>direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better</p>\n<p>dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,</p>\n<p>crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene</p>",
        "<p>Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she</p>\n<p>stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of</p>\n<p>the hall, looking back into the street.</p>\n<p>“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“He is dead,” cried several voices.</p>\n<p>“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone</p>\n<p>before you can get him to hospital.”</p>",
        "<p>“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s</p>\n<p>purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a</p>\n<p>rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”</p>\n<p>“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”</p>\n<p>“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.</p>\n<p>This way, please!”</p>\n<p>Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the</p>",
        "<p>principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by</p>\n<p>the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,</p>\n<p>so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know</p>\n<p>whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he</p>\n<p>was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of</p>\n<p>myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I</p>\n<p>was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon</p>",
        "<p>the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes</p>\n<p>to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened</p>\n<p>my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I</p>\n<p>thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from</p>\n<p>injuring another.</p>\n<p>Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who</p>\n<p>is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At</p>",
        "<p>the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my</p>\n<p>rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out</p>\n<p>of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and</p>\n<p>ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of</p>\n<p>“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the</p>\n<p>open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later</p>\n<p>the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false</p>",
        "<p>alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner</p>\n<p>of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm</p>\n<p>in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly</p>\n<p>and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the</p>\n<p>quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.</p>\n<p>“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been</p>\n<p>better. It is all right.”</p>",
        "<p>“You have the photograph?”</p>\n<p>“I know where it is.”</p>\n<p>“And how did you find out?”</p>\n<p>“She showed me, as I told you she would.”</p>\n<p>“I am still in the dark.”</p>\n<p>“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was</p>\n<p>perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was</p>",
        "<p>an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”</p>\n<p>“I guessed as much.”</p>\n<p>“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the</p>\n<p>palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my</p>\n<p>face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”</p>\n<p>“That also I could fathom.”</p>\n<p>“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could</p>",
        "<p>she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I</p>\n<p>suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to</p>\n<p>see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were</p>\n<p>compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”</p>\n<p>“How did that help you?”</p>\n<p>“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,</p>\n<p>her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It</p>",
        "<p>is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken</p>\n<p>advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it</p>\n<p>was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married</p>\n<p>woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.</p>\n<p>Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house</p>\n<p>more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to</p>\n<p>secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting</p>",
        "<p>were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The</p>\n<p>photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right</p>\n<p>bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as</p>\n<p>she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she</p>\n<p>replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have</p>\n<p>not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the</p>\n<p>house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;</p>",
        "<p>but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it</p>\n<p>seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”</p>\n<p>“And now?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King</p>\n<p>to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown</p>\n<p>into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that</p>\n<p>when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be</p>",
        "<p>a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”</p>\n<p>“And when will you call?”</p>\n<p>“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a</p>\n<p>clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a</p>\n<p>complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without</p>\n<p>delay.”</p>\n<p>We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was</p>",
        "<p>searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:</p>\n<p>“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”</p>\n<p>There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting</p>\n<p>appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit</p>\n<p>street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”</p>\n<p>III.</p>",
        "<p>I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast</p>\n<p>and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either</p>\n<p>shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.</p>\n<p>“Not yet.”</p>\n<p>“But you have hopes?”</p>",
        "<p>“I have hopes.”</p>\n<p>“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”</p>\n<p>“We must have a cab.”</p>\n<p>“No, my brougham is waiting.”</p>\n<p>“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once</p>\n<p>more for Briony Lodge.</p>\n<p>“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.</p>",
        "<p>“Married! When?”</p>\n<p>“Yesterday.”</p>\n<p>“But to whom?”</p>\n<p>“To an English lawyer named Norton.”</p>\n<p>“But she could not love him.”</p>\n<p>“I am in hopes that she does.”</p>\n<p>“And why in hopes?”</p>",
        "<p>“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If</p>\n<p>the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does</p>\n<p>not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with</p>\n<p>your Majesty’s plan.”</p>\n<p>“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!</p>\n<p>What a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,</p>\n<p>which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.</p>",
        "<p>The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the</p>\n<p>steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the</p>\n<p>brougham.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.</p>\n<p>“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a</p>\n<p>questioning and rather startled gaze.</p>\n<p>“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left</p>",
        "<p>this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for</p>\n<p>the Continent.”</p>\n<p>“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and</p>\n<p>surprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”</p>\n<p>“Never to return.”</p>\n<p>“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.”</p>\n<p>“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the</p>",
        "<p>drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was</p>\n<p>scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open</p>\n<p>drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.</p>\n<p>Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,</p>\n<p>plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The</p>\n<p>photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was</p>\n<p>superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My</p>",
        "<p>friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at</p>\n<p>midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:</p>\n<p>“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took</p>\n<p>me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a</p>\n<p>suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I</p>\n<p>began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had</p>\n<p>been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly</p>",
        "<p>be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you</p>\n<p>made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became</p>\n<p>suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old</p>\n<p>clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.</p>\n<p>Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the</p>\n<p>freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,</p>\n<p>ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came</p>",
        "<p>down just as you departed.</p>\n<p>“Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was</p>\n<p>really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.</p>\n<p>Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for</p>\n<p>the Temple to see my husband.</p>\n<p>“We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so</p>\n<p>formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you</p>",
        "<p>call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in</p>\n<p>peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do</p>\n<p>what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly</p>\n<p>wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a</p>\n<p>weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might</p>\n<p>take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to</p>\n<p>possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,</p>",
        "<p>“Very truly yours,</p>\n<p>“IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.”</p>\n<p>“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had</p>\n<p>all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute</p>\n<p>she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity</p>\n<p>that she was not on my level?”</p>\n<p>“From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very</p>",
        "<p>different level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that</p>\n<p>I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more</p>\n<p>successful conclusion.”</p>\n<p>“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more</p>\n<p>successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as</p>\n<p>safe as if it were in the fire.”</p>\n<p>“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward</p>\n<p>you. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and</p>\n<p>held it out upon the palm of his hand.</p>\n<p>“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”</p>\n<p>said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“You have but to name it.”</p>\n<p>“This photograph!”</p>",
        "<p>The King stared at him in amazement.</p>\n<p>“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”</p>\n<p>“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.</p>\n<p>I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and,</p>\n<p>turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched</p>\n<p>out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.</p>\n<p>And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of</p>",
        "<p>Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a</p>\n<p>woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I</p>\n<p>have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or</p>\n<p>when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable</p>\n<p>title of _the_ woman.</p>",
        "<h3>The Red-Headed League</h3>\n<p>II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</p>\n<p>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the</p>\n<p>autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very</p>\n<p>stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an</p>\n<p>apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled</p>\n<p>me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.</p>",
        "<p>“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he</p>\n<p>said cordially.</p>\n<p>“I was afraid that you were engaged.”</p>\n<p>“So I am. Very much so.”</p>\n<p>“Then I can wait in the next room.”</p>\n<p>“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper</p>\n<p>in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will</p>",
        "<p>be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”</p>\n<p>The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of</p>\n<p>greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small</p>\n<p>fat-encircled eyes.</p>\n<p>“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting</p>\n<p>his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I</p>\n<p>know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and</p>",
        "<p>outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have</p>\n<p>shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to</p>\n<p>chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish</p>\n<p>so many of my own little adventures.”</p>\n<p>“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I</p>\n<p>observed.</p>\n<p>“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went</p>",
        "<p>into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that</p>\n<p>for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life</p>\n<p>itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the</p>\n<p>imagination.”</p>\n<p>“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”</p>\n<p>“You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for</p>\n<p>otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your</p>",
        "<p>reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.</p>\n<p>Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,</p>\n<p>and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular</p>\n<p>which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that</p>\n<p>the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with</p>\n<p>the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where</p>\n<p>there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.</p>",
        "<p>As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the</p>\n<p>present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events</p>\n<p>is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence</p>\n<p>your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has</p>\n<p>not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the</p>\n<p>story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As</p>",
        "<p>a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of</p>\n<p>events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar</p>\n<p>cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to</p>\n<p>admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”</p>\n<p>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some</p>\n<p>little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside</p>\n<p>pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,</p>",
        "<p>with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,</p>\n<p>I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my</p>\n<p>companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his</p>\n<p>dress or appearance.</p>\n<p>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore</p>\n<p>every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,</p>\n<p>pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers,</p>",
        "<p>a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab</p>\n<p>waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of</p>\n<p>metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown</p>\n<p>overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.</p>\n<p>Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man</p>\n<p>save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and</p>\n<p>discontent upon his features.</p>",
        "<p>Sherlock Holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head</p>\n<p>with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the obvious</p>\n<p>facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,</p>\n<p>that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done</p>\n<p>a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the</p>\n<p>paper, but his eyes upon my companion.</p>",
        "<p>“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?”</p>\n<p>he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.</p>\n<p>It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”</p>\n<p>“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than</p>\n<p>your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more</p>\n<p>developed.”</p>\n<p>“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”</p>",
        "<p>“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,</p>\n<p>especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use</p>\n<p>an arc-and-compass breastpin.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”</p>\n<p>“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five</p>\n<p>inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you</p>\n<p>rest it upon the desk?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, but China?”</p>\n<p>“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist</p>\n<p>could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo</p>\n<p>marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That</p>\n<p>trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite</p>\n<p>peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from</p>\n<p>your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought</p>\n<p>at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was</p>\n<p>nothing in it after all.”</p>\n<p>“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in</p>\n<p>explaining. ‘_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_,’ you know, and my poor</p>\n<p>little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so</p>\n<p>candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted</p>\n<p>halfway down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it all. You</p>\n<p>just read it for yourself, sir.”</p>\n<p>I took the paper from him and read as follows:</p>\n<p>“TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late</p>\n<p>Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another</p>\n<p>vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of £ 4 a</p>",
        "<p>week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in</p>\n<p>body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.</p>\n<p>Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the</p>\n<p>offices of the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.”</p>\n<p>“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated after I had twice read</p>\n<p>over the extraordinary announcement.</p>\n<p>Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in</p>",
        "<p>high spirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he.</p>\n<p>“And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about</p>\n<p>yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had</p>\n<p>upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper</p>\n<p>and the date.”</p>\n<p>“It is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”</p>\n<p>“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”</p>\n<p>said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s</p>\n<p>business at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large affair,</p>\n<p>and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I</p>\n<p>used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I</p>\n<p>would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half</p>\n<p>wages so as to learn the business.”</p>",
        "<p>“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.</p>\n<p>“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s</p>\n<p>hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;</p>\n<p>and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I</p>\n<p>am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I</p>\n<p>put ideas in his head?”</p>\n<p>“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes</p>",
        "<p>under the full market price. It is not a common experience among</p>\n<p>employers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as</p>\n<p>remarkable as your advertisement.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow</p>\n<p>for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be</p>\n<p>improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit</p>\n<p>into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on</p>",
        "<p>the whole he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”</p>\n<p>“He is still with you, I presume?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking</p>\n<p>and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a</p>\n<p>widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three</p>\n<p>of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do</p>\n<p>nothing more.</p>",
        "<p>“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he</p>\n<p>came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very</p>\n<p>paper in his hand, and he says:</p>\n<p>“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’</p>\n<p>“‘Why that?’ I asks.</p>\n<p>“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the</p>\n<p>Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets</p>",
        "<p>it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,</p>\n<p>so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.</p>\n<p>If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all</p>\n<p>ready for me to step into.’</p>\n<p>“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very</p>\n<p>stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to</p>\n<p>go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the</p>",
        "<p>door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,</p>\n<p>and I was always glad of a bit of news.</p>\n<p>“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked</p>\n<p>with his eyes open.</p>\n<p>“‘Never.’</p>\n<p>“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the</p>\n<p>vacancies.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it</p>\n<p>need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’</p>\n<p>“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the</p>\n<p>business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of</p>\n<p>hundred would have been very handy.</p>\n<p>“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for</p>\n<p>yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where</p>\n<p>you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League</p>\n<p>was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very</p>\n<p>peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great</p>\n<p>sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he</p>\n<p>had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with</p>",
        "<p>instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to</p>\n<p>men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay</p>\n<p>and very little to do.’</p>\n<p>“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would</p>\n<p>apply.’</p>\n<p>“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really</p>\n<p>confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from</p>",
        "<p>London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.</p>\n<p>Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is</p>\n<p>light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery</p>\n<p>red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;</p>\n<p>but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of</p>\n<p>the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’</p>\n<p>“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my</p>",
        "<p>hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if</p>\n<p>there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance</p>\n<p>as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so</p>\n<p>much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered</p>\n<p>him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.</p>\n<p>He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and</p>\n<p>started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.</p>",
        "<p>“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From</p>\n<p>north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his</p>\n<p>hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet</p>\n<p>Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a</p>\n<p>coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in</p>\n<p>the whole country as were brought together by that single</p>\n<p>advertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange,</p>",
        "<p>brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were</p>\n<p>not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how</p>\n<p>many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding</p>\n<p>would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed</p>\n<p>and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up</p>\n<p>to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon</p>\n<p>the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we</p>",
        "<p>wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”</p>\n<p>“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes as</p>\n<p>his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.</p>\n<p>“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”</p>\n<p>“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a</p>\n<p>deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even</p>\n<p>redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up,</p>",
        "<p>and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would</p>\n<p>disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy</p>\n<p>matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much</p>\n<p>more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door</p>\n<p>as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.</p>\n<p>“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to</p>\n<p>fill a vacancy in the League.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every</p>\n<p>requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He</p>\n<p>took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair</p>\n<p>until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my</p>\n<p>hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.</p>\n<p>“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am</p>\n<p>sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized</p>",
        "<p>my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.</p>\n<p>‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive</p>\n<p>that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have</p>\n<p>twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales</p>\n<p>of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped</p>\n<p>over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that</p>\n<p>the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,</p>",
        "<p>and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was</p>\n<p>not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.</p>\n<p>“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the</p>\n<p>pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a</p>\n<p>married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’</p>\n<p>“I answered that I had not.</p>\n<p>“His face fell immediately.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry</p>\n<p>to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and</p>\n<p>spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is</p>\n<p>exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’</p>\n<p>“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not</p>\n<p>to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few</p>\n<p>minutes he said that it would be all right.</p>",
        "<p>“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but</p>\n<p>we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as</p>\n<p>yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’</p>\n<p>“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I</p>\n<p>should be able to look after that for you.’</p>\n<p>“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Ten to two.’</p>\n<p>“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,</p>\n<p>especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;</p>\n<p>so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.</p>\n<p>Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see</p>\n<p>to anything that turned up.</p>\n<p>“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Is £ 4 a week.’</p>\n<p>“‘And the work?’</p>\n<p>“‘Is purely nominal.’</p>\n<p>“‘What do you call purely nominal?’</p>\n<p>“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the</p>\n<p>whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The</p>\n<p>will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the</p>",
        "<p>conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’</p>\n<p>“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said</p>\n<p>I.</p>\n<p>“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor</p>\n<p>business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your</p>\n<p>billet.’</p>\n<p>“‘And the work?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Is to copy out the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. There is the first</p>\n<p>volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and</p>\n<p>blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready</p>\n<p>to-morrow?’</p>\n<p>“‘Certainly,’ I answered.</p>\n<p>“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once</p>\n<p>more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to</p>",
        "<p>gain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,</p>\n<p>hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good</p>\n<p>fortune.</p>\n<p>“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low</p>\n<p>spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair</p>\n<p>must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I</p>\n<p>could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could</p>",
        "<p>make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything</p>\n<p>so simple as copying out the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. Vincent</p>\n<p>Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had</p>\n<p>reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I</p>\n<p>determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of</p>\n<p>ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I</p>\n<p>started off for Pope’s Court.</p>",
        "<p>“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.</p>\n<p>The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to</p>\n<p>see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and</p>\n<p>then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all</p>\n<p>was right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me</p>\n<p>upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office</p>\n<p>after me.</p>",
        "<p>“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager</p>\n<p>came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It</p>\n<p>was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I</p>\n<p>was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.</p>\n<p>Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a</p>\n<p>time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to</p>\n<p>leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,</p>",
        "<p>and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would</p>\n<p>not risk the loss of it.</p>\n<p>“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and</p>\n<p>Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with</p>\n<p>diligence that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me</p>\n<p>something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my</p>\n<p>writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”</p>",
        "<p>“To an end?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual</p>\n<p>at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square</p>\n<p>of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here</p>\n<p>it is, and you can read for yourself.”</p>\n<p>He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of</p>\n<p>note-paper. It read in this fashion:</p>",
        "<p>“THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful</p>\n<p>face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely</p>\n<p>overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar</p>\n<p>of laughter.</p>\n<p>“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,</p>\n<p>flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing</p>",
        "<p>better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he</p>\n<p>had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is</p>\n<p>most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying</p>\n<p>so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you</p>\n<p>take when you found the card upon the door?”</p>\n<p>“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the</p>",
        "<p>offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.</p>\n<p>Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the</p>\n<p>ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of</p>\n<p>the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such</p>\n<p>body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the</p>\n<p>name was new to him.</p>\n<p>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘What, the red-headed man?’</p>\n<p>“‘Yes.’</p>\n<p>“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and</p>\n<p>was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises</p>\n<p>were ready. He moved out yesterday.’</p>\n<p>“‘Where could I find him?’</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King</p>",
        "<p>Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’</p>\n<p>“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a</p>\n<p>manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of</p>\n<p>either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”</p>\n<p>“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.</p>\n<p>“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my</p>\n<p>assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that</p>",
        "<p>if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,</p>\n<p>Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,</p>\n<p>as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk</p>\n<p>who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”</p>\n<p>“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly</p>\n<p>remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you</p>\n<p>have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from</p>",
        "<p>it than might at first sight appear.”</p>\n<p>“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a</p>\n<p>week.”</p>\n<p>“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not</p>\n<p>see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On</p>\n<p>the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say</p>\n<p>nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject</p>",
        "<p>which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”</p>\n<p>“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what</p>\n<p>their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It</p>\n<p>was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty</p>\n<p>pounds.”</p>\n<p>“We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one</p>\n<p>or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called</p>",
        "<p>your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”</p>\n<p>“About a month then.”</p>\n<p>“How did he come?”</p>\n<p>“In answer to an advertisement.”</p>\n<p>“Was he the only applicant?”</p>\n<p>“No, I had a dozen.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you pick him?”</p>",
        "<p>“Because he was handy and would come cheap.”</p>\n<p>“At half wages, in fact.”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”</p>\n<p>“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,</p>\n<p>though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his</p>\n<p>forehead.”</p>",
        "<p>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as</p>\n<p>much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for</p>\n<p>earrings?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a</p>\n<p>lad.”</p>\n<p>“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with</p>\n<p>you?”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.”</p>\n<p>“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a</p>\n<p>morning.”</p>\n<p>“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon</p>\n<p>the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I</p>\n<p>hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, Watson,” said Holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you</p>\n<p>make of it all?”</p>\n<p>“I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most mysterious</p>\n<p>business.”</p>\n<p>“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less</p>\n<p>mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes</p>\n<p>which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most</p>",
        "<p>difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”</p>\n<p>“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg</p>\n<p>that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in</p>\n<p>his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and</p>\n<p>there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out</p>\n<p>like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that</p>",
        "<p>he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly</p>\n<p>sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his</p>\n<p>mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.</p>\n<p>“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked.</p>\n<p>“What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few</p>\n<p>hours?”</p>\n<p>“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and</p>\n<p>we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal</p>\n<p>of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than</p>\n<p>Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come</p>\n<p>along!”</p>\n<p>We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk</p>\n<p>took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we</p>",
        "<p>had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel</p>\n<p>place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out</p>\n<p>into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few</p>\n<p>clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden</p>\n<p>and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with</p>\n<p>“JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the</p>\n<p>place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock</p>",
        "<p>Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it</p>\n<p>all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he</p>\n<p>walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still</p>\n<p>looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s,</p>\n<p>and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or</p>\n<p>three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly</p>\n<p>opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to</p>",
        "<p>step in.</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go</p>\n<p>from here to the Strand.”</p>\n<p>“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing</p>\n<p>the door.</p>\n<p>“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my</p>\n<p>judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not</p>",
        "<p>sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him</p>\n<p>before.”</p>\n<p>“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in</p>\n<p>this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your</p>\n<p>way merely in order that you might see him.”</p>\n<p>“Not him.”</p>\n<p>“What then?”</p>",
        "<p>“The knees of his trousers.”</p>\n<p>“And what did you see?”</p>\n<p>“What I expected to see.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you beat the pavement?”</p>\n<p>“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are</p>\n<p>spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.</p>\n<p>Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”</p>",
        "<p>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from</p>\n<p>the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as</p>\n<p>the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main</p>\n<p>arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.</p>\n<p>The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in</p>\n<p>a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with</p>\n<p>the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we</p>",
        "<p>looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that</p>\n<p>they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant</p>\n<p>square which we had just quitted.</p>\n<p>“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along</p>\n<p>the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.</p>\n<p>It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is</p>\n<p>Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg</p>",
        "<p>branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and</p>\n<p>McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the</p>\n<p>other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had</p>\n<p>some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,</p>\n<p>where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no</p>\n<p>red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”</p>\n<p>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very</p>",
        "<p>capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the</p>\n<p>afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,</p>\n<p>gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his</p>\n<p>gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those</p>\n<p>of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,</p>\n<p>ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his</p>\n<p>singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his</p>",
        "<p>extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,</p>\n<p>the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which</p>\n<p>occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from</p>\n<p>extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never</p>\n<p>so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in</p>\n<p>his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.</p>\n<p>Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,</p>",
        "<p>and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of</p>\n<p>intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would</p>\n<p>look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other</p>\n<p>mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.</p>\n<p>James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom</p>\n<p>he had set himself to hunt down.</p>\n<p>“You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, it would be as well.”</p>\n<p>“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This</p>\n<p>business at Coburg Square is serious.”</p>\n<p>“Why serious?”</p>\n<p>“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to</p>\n<p>believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday</p>\n<p>rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”</p>",
        "<p>“At what time?”</p>\n<p>“Ten will be early enough.”</p>\n<p>“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”</p>\n<p>“Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so</p>\n<p>kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand,</p>\n<p>turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.</p>\n<p>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always</p>",
        "<p>oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock</p>\n<p>Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had</p>\n<p>seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not</p>\n<p>only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the</p>\n<p>whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my</p>\n<p>house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story</p>\n<p>of the red-headed copier of the _Encyclopædia_ down to the visit to</p>",
        "<p>Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from</p>\n<p>me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?</p>\n<p>Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes</p>\n<p>that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a</p>\n<p>man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it</p>\n<p>up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an</p>\n<p>explanation.</p>",
        "<p>It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way</p>\n<p>across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two</p>\n<p>hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard</p>\n<p>the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in</p>\n<p>animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter</p>\n<p>Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,</p>\n<p>sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable</p>",
        "<p>frock-coat.</p>\n<p>“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket</p>\n<p>and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you</p>\n<p>know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.</p>\n<p>Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”</p>\n<p>“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his</p>\n<p>consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a</p>",
        "<p>chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”</p>\n<p>“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”</p>\n<p>observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.</p>\n<p>“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the</p>\n<p>police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he</p>\n<p>won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,</p>\n<p>but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say</p>",
        "<p>that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the</p>\n<p>Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official</p>\n<p>force.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with</p>\n<p>deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first</p>\n<p>Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my</p>\n<p>rubber.”</p>",
        "<p>“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for</p>\n<p>a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play</p>\n<p>will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be</p>\n<p>some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you</p>\n<p>wish to lay your hands.”</p>\n<p>“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,</p>\n<p>Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would</p>",
        "<p>rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a</p>\n<p>remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,</p>\n<p>and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as</p>\n<p>his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never</p>\n<p>know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one</p>\n<p>week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.</p>\n<p>I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”</p>",
        "<p>“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve</p>\n<p>had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with</p>\n<p>you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,</p>\n<p>and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,</p>\n<p>Watson and I will follow in the second.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and</p>\n<p>lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the</p>",
        "<p>afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets</p>\n<p>until we emerged into Farrington Street.</p>\n<p>“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather</p>\n<p>is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought</p>\n<p>it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though</p>\n<p>an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He</p>\n<p>is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his</p>",
        "<p>claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”</p>\n<p>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found</p>\n<p>ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the</p>\n<p>guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and</p>\n<p>through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small</p>\n<p>corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was</p>\n<p>opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated</p>",
        "<p>at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a</p>\n<p>lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and</p>\n<p>so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was</p>\n<p>piled all round with crates and massive boxes.</p>\n<p>“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up</p>\n<p>the lantern and gazed about him.</p>\n<p>“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the</p>",
        "<p>flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he</p>\n<p>remarked, looking up in surprise.</p>\n<p>“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes</p>\n<p>severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our</p>\n<p>expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down</p>\n<p>upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”</p>\n<p>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very</p>",
        "<p>injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon</p>\n<p>the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine</p>\n<p>minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to</p>\n<p>satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his</p>\n<p>pocket.</p>\n<p>“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly</p>\n<p>take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they</p>",
        "<p>will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer</p>\n<p>time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no</p>\n<p>doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the</p>\n<p>principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,</p>\n<p>and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring</p>\n<p>criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar</p>\n<p>at present.”</p>",
        "<p>“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several</p>\n<p>warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”</p>\n<p>“Your French gold?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and</p>\n<p>borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It</p>\n<p>has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,</p>\n<p>and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit</p>",
        "<p>contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our</p>\n<p>reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a</p>\n<p>single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the</p>\n<p>subject.”</p>\n<p>“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time</p>\n<p>that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters</p>\n<p>will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the</p>",
        "<p>screen over that dark lantern.”</p>\n<p>“And sit in the dark?”</p>\n<p>“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I</p>\n<p>thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber</p>\n<p>after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far</p>\n<p>that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must</p>\n<p>choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take</p>",
        "<p>them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.</p>\n<p>I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind</p>\n<p>those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they</p>\n<p>fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”</p>\n<p>I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind</p>\n<p>which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern</p>\n<p>and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never</p>",
        "<p>before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that</p>\n<p>the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To</p>\n<p>me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was</p>\n<p>something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold</p>\n<p>dank air of the vault.</p>\n<p>“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through</p>\n<p>the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I</p>",
        "<p>asked you, Jones?”</p>\n<p>“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”</p>\n<p>“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and</p>\n<p>wait.”</p>\n<p>What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an</p>\n<p>hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have</p>\n<p>almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and</p>",
        "<p>stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up</p>\n<p>to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I</p>\n<p>could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could</p>\n<p>distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the</p>\n<p>thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look</p>\n<p>over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught</p>\n<p>the glint of a light.</p>",
        "<p>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it</p>\n<p>lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any</p>\n<p>warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,</p>\n<p>almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area</p>\n<p>of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,</p>\n<p>protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it</p>\n<p>appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which</p>",
        "<p>marked a chink between the stones.</p>\n<p>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing</p>\n<p>sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and</p>\n<p>left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a</p>\n<p>lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which</p>\n<p>looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the</p>\n<p>aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee</p>",
        "<p>rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the</p>\n<p>hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like</p>\n<p>himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.</p>\n<p>“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags?</p>\n<p>Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.</p>\n<p>The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth</p>",
        "<p>as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a</p>\n<p>revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and</p>\n<p>the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.</p>\n<p>“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at</p>\n<p>all.”</p>\n<p>“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that</p>\n<p>my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”</p>",
        "<p>“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must</p>\n<p>compliment you.”</p>\n<p>“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and</p>\n<p>effective.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at</p>\n<p>climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”</p>",
        "<p>“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our</p>\n<p>prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be</p>\n<p>aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,</p>\n<p>when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you</p>\n<p>please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your</p>\n<p>Highness to the police-station?”</p>",
        "<p>“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to</p>\n<p>the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.</p>\n<p>“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from</p>\n<p>the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most</p>\n<p>complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery</p>\n<p>that have ever come within my experience.”</p>",
        "<p>“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John</p>\n<p>Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this</p>\n<p>matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am</p>\n<p>amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,</p>\n<p>and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”</p>\n<p>“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we</p>\n<p>sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly</p>",
        "<p>obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather</p>\n<p>fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying</p>\n<p>of the _Encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker</p>\n<p>out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of</p>\n<p>managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.</p>\n<p>The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the</p>\n<p>colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must</p>",
        "<p>draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They</p>\n<p>put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other</p>\n<p>rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to</p>\n<p>secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I</p>\n<p>heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me</p>\n<p>that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”</p>\n<p>“But how could you guess what the motive was?”</p>",
        "<p>“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere</p>\n<p>vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s</p>\n<p>business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which</p>\n<p>could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure</p>\n<p>as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What</p>\n<p>could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and</p>\n<p>his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end</p>",
        "<p>of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious</p>\n<p>assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most</p>\n<p>daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the</p>\n<p>cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What</p>\n<p>could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was</p>\n<p>running a tunnel to some other building.</p>\n<p>“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I</p>",
        "<p>surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was</p>\n<p>ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It</p>\n<p>was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant</p>\n<p>answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes</p>\n<p>upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were</p>\n<p>what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,</p>\n<p>wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of</p>",
        "<p>burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I</p>\n<p>walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our</p>\n<p>friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you</p>\n<p>drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the</p>\n<p>chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”</p>\n<p>“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I</p>\n<p>asked.</p>",
        "<p>“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they</p>\n<p>cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that</p>\n<p>they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should</p>\n<p>use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be</p>\n<p>removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it</p>\n<p>would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I</p>\n<p>expected them to come to-night.”</p>",
        "<p>“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.</p>\n<p>“It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”</p>\n<p>“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel</p>\n<p>it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape</p>\n<p>from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do</p>\n<p>so.”</p>\n<p>“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.</p>",
        "<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some</p>\n<p>little use,” he remarked. “‘_L’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout_,’</p>\n<p>as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.”</p>",
        "<h3>A Case of Identity</h3>\n<p>III. A CASE OF IDENTITY</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the</p>\n<p>fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than</p>\n<p>anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to</p>\n<p>conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If</p>\n<p>we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great</p>",
        "<p>city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which</p>\n<p>are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the</p>\n<p>cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through</p>\n<p>generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all</p>\n<p>fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale</p>\n<p>and unprofitable.”</p>\n<p>“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come</p>",
        "<p>to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.</p>\n<p>We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and</p>\n<p>yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor</p>\n<p>artistic.”</p>\n<p>“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a</p>\n<p>realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police</p>\n<p>report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the</p>",
        "<p>magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the</p>\n<p>vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so</p>\n<p>unnatural as the commonplace.”</p>\n<p>I smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,”</p>\n<p>I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper</p>\n<p>to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,</p>\n<p>you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But</p>",
        "<p>here”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a</p>\n<p>practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A</p>\n<p>husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I</p>\n<p>know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There</p>\n<p>is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the</p>\n<p>bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers</p>\n<p>could invent nothing more crude.”</p>",
        "<p>“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said</p>\n<p>Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the</p>\n<p>Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing</p>\n<p>up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a</p>\n<p>teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was</p>\n<p>that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking</p>\n<p>out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will</p>",
        "<p>allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the</p>\n<p>average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge</p>\n<p>that I have scored over you in your example.”</p>\n<p>He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the</p>\n<p>centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely</p>\n<p>ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is</p>",
        "<p>a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance</p>\n<p>in the case of the Irene Adler papers.”</p>\n<p>“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which</p>\n<p>sparkled upon his finger.</p>\n<p>“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which</p>\n<p>I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to</p>\n<p>you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little</p>",
        "<p>problems.”</p>\n<p>“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.</p>\n<p>“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.</p>\n<p>They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,</p>\n<p>I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a</p>\n<p>field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and</p>\n<p>effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are</p>",
        "<p>apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a</p>\n<p>rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate</p>\n<p>matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing</p>\n<p>which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that</p>\n<p>I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this</p>\n<p>is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”</p>\n<p>He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds</p>",
        "<p>gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over</p>\n<p>his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large</p>\n<p>woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red</p>\n<p>feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess</p>\n<p>of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she</p>\n<p>peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her</p>\n<p>body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her</p>",
        "<p>glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves</p>\n<p>the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of</p>\n<p>the bell.</p>\n<p>“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his</p>\n<p>cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an</p>\n<p>_affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the</p>\n<p>matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may</p>",
        "<p>discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no</p>\n<p>longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we</p>\n<p>may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so</p>\n<p>much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to</p>\n<p>resolve our doubts.”</p>\n<p>As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered</p>\n<p>to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind</p>",
        "<p>his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny</p>\n<p>pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for</p>\n<p>which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into</p>\n<p>an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted</p>\n<p>fashion which was peculiar to him.</p>\n<p>“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little</p>\n<p>trying to do so much typewriting?”</p>",
        "<p>“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are</p>\n<p>without looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his</p>\n<p>words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and</p>\n<p>astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You’ve heard about</p>\n<p>me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?”</p>\n<p>“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why</p>",
        "<p>should you come to consult me?”</p>\n<p>“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose</p>\n<p>husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up</p>\n<p>for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not</p>\n<p>rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the</p>\n<p>little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what</p>\n<p>has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</p>",
        "<p>“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock</p>\n<p>Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary</p>\n<p>Sutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made</p>\n<p>me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my</p>\n<p>father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go</p>\n<p>to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that</p>",
        "<p>there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things</p>\n<p>and came right away to you.”</p>\n<p>“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is</p>\n<p>different.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,</p>\n<p>for he is only five years and two months older than myself.”</p>\n<p>“And your mother is alive?”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,</p>\n<p>when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was</p>\n<p>nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the</p>\n<p>Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which</p>\n<p>mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank</p>\n<p>came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a</p>\n<p>traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,</p>",
        "<p>which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been</p>\n<p>alive.”</p>\n<p>I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and</p>\n<p>inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with</p>\n<p>the greatest concentration of attention.</p>\n<p>“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in</p>",
        "<p>Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand</p>\n<p>five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”</p>\n<p>“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large</p>\n<p>a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no</p>\n<p>doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that</p>\n<p>a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”</p>\n<p>“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand</p>",
        "<p>that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and</p>\n<p>so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of</p>\n<p>course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest</p>\n<p>every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do</p>\n<p>pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a</p>\n<p>sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”</p>\n<p>“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is</p>",
        "<p>my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before</p>\n<p>myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer</p>\n<p>Angel.”</p>\n<p>A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at</p>\n<p>the fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,”</p>\n<p>she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then</p>\n<p>afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank</p>",
        "<p>did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would</p>\n<p>get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But</p>\n<p>this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to</p>\n<p>prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all</p>\n<p>father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit</p>\n<p>to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken</p>\n<p>out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to</p>",
        "<p>France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with</p>\n<p>Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.</p>\n<p>Hosmer Angel.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from</p>\n<p>France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and</p>\n<p>shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a</p>",
        "<p>woman, for she would have her way.”</p>\n<p>“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a</p>\n<p>gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we</p>\n<p>had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr.</p>\n<p>Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back</p>\n<p>again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”</p>",
        "<p>“No?”</p>\n<p>“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t</p>\n<p>have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman</p>\n<p>should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to</p>\n<p>mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got</p>\n<p>mine yet.”</p>\n<p>“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote</p>\n<p>and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until</p>\n<p>he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every</p>\n<p>day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for</p>\n<p>father to know.”</p>\n<p>“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we</p>",
        "<p>took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall</p>\n<p>Street—and—”</p>\n<p>“What office?”</p>\n<p>“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Where did he live, then?”</p>\n<p>“He slept on the premises.”</p>\n<p>“And you don’t know his address?”</p>",
        "<p>“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”</p>\n<p>“Where did you address your letters, then?”</p>\n<p>“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He</p>\n<p>said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all</p>\n<p>the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to</p>\n<p>typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said</p>\n<p>that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were</p>",
        "<p>typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That</p>\n<p>will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little</p>\n<p>things that he would think of.”</p>\n<p>“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of</p>\n<p>mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you</p>\n<p>remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”</p>\n<p>“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the</p>",
        "<p>evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be</p>\n<p>conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was</p>\n<p>gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he</p>\n<p>told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,</p>\n<p>whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and</p>\n<p>plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted</p>\n<p>glasses against the glare.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned</p>\n<p>to France?”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should</p>\n<p>marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me</p>\n<p>swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would</p>\n<p>always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,</p>\n<p>and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour</p>",
        "<p>from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they</p>\n<p>talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but</p>\n<p>they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him</p>\n<p>afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I</p>\n<p>didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask</p>\n<p>his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want</p>\n<p>to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the</p>",
        "<p>company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the</p>\n<p>very morning of the wedding.”</p>\n<p>“It missed him, then?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”</p>\n<p>“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the</p>\n<p>Friday. Was it to be in church?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s</p>",
        "<p>Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras</p>\n<p>Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he</p>\n<p>put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which</p>\n<p>happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church</p>\n<p>first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step</p>\n<p>out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and</p>\n<p>looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not</p>",
        "<p>imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own</p>\n<p>eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard</p>\n<p>anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said</p>\n<p>Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the</p>\n<p>morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;</p>",
        "<p>and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I</p>\n<p>was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would</p>\n<p>claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a</p>\n<p>wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”</p>\n<p>“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some</p>\n<p>unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not</p>",
        "<p>have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”</p>\n<p>“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”</p>\n<p>“None.”</p>\n<p>“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”</p>\n<p>“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter</p>\n<p>again.”</p>\n<p>“And your father? Did you tell him?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and</p>\n<p>that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could</p>\n<p>anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving</p>\n<p>me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got</p>\n<p>my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was</p>\n<p>very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of</p>\n<p>mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?</p>",
        "<p>Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at</p>\n<p>night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to</p>\n<p>sob heavily into it.</p>\n<p>“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising, “and I</p>\n<p>have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight</p>\n<p>of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it</p>\n<p>further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your</p>",
        "<p>memory, as he has done from your life.”</p>\n<p>“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”</p>\n<p>“I fear not.”</p>\n<p>“Then what has happened to him?”</p>\n<p>“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate</p>\n<p>description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”</p>\n<p>“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s _Chronicle_,” said she. “Here</p>",
        "<p>is the slip and here are four letters from him.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. And your address?”</p>\n<p>“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your</p>\n<p>father’s place of business?”</p>\n<p>“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of</p>\n<p>Fenchurch Street.”</p>",
        "<p>“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave</p>\n<p>the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let</p>\n<p>the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your</p>\n<p>life.”</p>\n<p>“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true</p>\n<p>to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”</p>\n<p>For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something</p>",
        "<p>noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.</p>\n<p>She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,</p>\n<p>with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still</p>\n<p>pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze</p>\n<p>directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old</p>\n<p>and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit</p>",
        "<p>it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths</p>\n<p>spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.</p>\n<p>“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her</p>\n<p>more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather</p>\n<p>a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in</p>\n<p>Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last</p>\n<p>year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which</p>",
        "<p>were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”</p>\n<p>“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to</p>\n<p>me,” I remarked.</p>\n<p>“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,</p>\n<p>and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to</p>\n<p>realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,</p>\n<p>or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you</p>",
        "<p>gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”</p>\n<p>“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a</p>\n<p>feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn</p>\n<p>upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was</p>\n<p>brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at</p>\n<p>the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at</p>\n<p>the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round,</p>",
        "<p>hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in</p>\n<p>a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.</p>\n<p>“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have</p>\n<p>really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed</p>\n<p>everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you</p>\n<p>have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my</p>",
        "<p>boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always</p>\n<p>at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the</p>\n<p>knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her</p>\n<p>sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double</p>\n<p>line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against</p>\n<p>the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand</p>\n<p>type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side</p>",
        "<p>of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the</p>\n<p>broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing</p>\n<p>the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark</p>\n<p>upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”</p>\n<p>“It surprised me.”</p>\n<p>“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested</p>\n<p>on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was</p>",
        "<p>wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one</p>\n<p>having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was</p>\n<p>buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at</p>\n<p>the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,</p>\n<p>otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,</p>\n<p>half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a</p>\n<p>hurry.”</p>",
        "<p>“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my</p>\n<p>friend’s incisive reasoning.</p>\n<p>“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home</p>\n<p>but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was</p>\n<p>torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove</p>\n<p>and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and</p>\n<p>dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark</p>",
        "<p>would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though</p>\n<p>rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you</p>\n<p>mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”</p>\n<p>I held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said, “on</p>\n<p>the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About</p>\n<p>five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black</p>\n<p>hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and</p>",
        "<p>moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,</p>\n<p>when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,</p>\n<p>gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters</p>\n<p>over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in</p>\n<p>Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,” &c, &c.</p>\n<p>“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued,</p>\n<p>glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in</p>",
        "<p>them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one</p>\n<p>remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”</p>\n<p>“They are typewritten,” I remarked.</p>\n<p>“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat</p>\n<p>little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no</p>\n<p>superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The</p>\n<p>point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it</p>",
        "<p>conclusive.”</p>\n<p>“Of what?”</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears</p>\n<p>upon the case?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to</p>\n<p>deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”</p>\n<p>“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which</p>",
        "<p>should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to</p>\n<p>the young lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could</p>\n<p>meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that</p>\n<p>we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can</p>\n<p>do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our</p>\n<p>little problem upon the shelf for the interim.”</p>\n<p>I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of</p>",
        "<p>reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must</p>\n<p>have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which</p>\n<p>he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to</p>\n<p>fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of</p>\n<p>Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to</p>\n<p>the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary</p>\n<p>circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would</p>",
        "<p>be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.</p>\n<p>I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the</p>\n<p>conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that</p>\n<p>he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity</p>\n<p>of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.</p>\n<p>A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at</p>\n<p>the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the</p>",
        "<p>sufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself</p>\n<p>free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,</p>\n<p>half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of</p>\n<p>the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half</p>\n<p>asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his</p>\n<p>armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the</p>\n<p>pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent</p>",
        "<p>his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.</p>\n<p>“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.</p>\n<p>“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”</p>\n<p>“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There</p>\n<p>was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some</p>\n<p>of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no</p>",
        "<p>law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”</p>\n<p>“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss</p>\n<p>Sutherland?”</p>\n<p>The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened</p>\n<p>his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a</p>\n<p>tap at the door.</p>\n<p>“This is the girl’s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He</p>",
        "<p>has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”</p>\n<p>The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty</p>\n<p>years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,</p>\n<p>insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating</p>\n<p>grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny</p>\n<p>top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the</p>\n<p>nearest chair.</p>",
        "<p>“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this</p>\n<p>typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with</p>\n<p>me for six o’clock?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my</p>\n<p>own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you</p>\n<p>about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash</p>\n<p>linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she</p>",
        "<p>came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have</p>\n<p>noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind</p>\n<p>on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not</p>\n<p>connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a</p>\n<p>family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless</p>\n<p>expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”</p>\n<p>“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe</p>",
        "<p>that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am</p>\n<p>delighted to hear it,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really</p>\n<p>quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are</p>\n<p>quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more</p>\n<p>worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in</p>",
        "<p>this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some</p>\n<p>little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the</p>\n<p>‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more</p>\n<p>obvious.”</p>\n<p>“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no</p>\n<p>doubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at</p>\n<p>Holmes with his bright little eyes.</p>",
        "<p>“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.</p>\n<p>Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little</p>\n<p>monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to</p>\n<p>crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I</p>\n<p>have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They</p>\n<p>are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and</p>\n<p>the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my</p>",
        "<p>magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I</p>\n<p>have alluded are there as well.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot</p>\n<p>waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If</p>\n<p>you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the</p>",
        "<p>door. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”</p>\n<p>“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and</p>\n<p>glancing about him like a rat in a trap.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes suavely. “There is no</p>\n<p>possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,</p>\n<p>and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible</p>\n<p>for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us</p>",
        "<p>talk it over.”</p>\n<p>Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter</p>\n<p>of moisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.</p>\n<p>“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,</p>\n<p>Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty</p>\n<p>way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of</p>\n<p>events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.”</p>",
        "<p>The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his</p>\n<p>breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on</p>\n<p>the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his</p>\n<p>pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.</p>\n<p>“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,”</p>\n<p>said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long</p>\n<p>as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their</p>",
        "<p>position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It</p>\n<p>was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable</p>\n<p>disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it</p>\n<p>was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little</p>\n<p>income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her</p>\n<p>marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what</p>\n<p>does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of</p>",
        "<p>keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of</p>\n<p>her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She</p>\n<p>became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her</p>\n<p>positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever</p>\n<p>stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head</p>\n<p>than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he</p>\n<p>disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked</p>",
        "<p>the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear</p>\n<p>voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the</p>\n<p>girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other</p>\n<p>lovers by making love himself.”</p>\n<p>“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought</p>\n<p>that she would have been so carried away.”</p>\n<p>“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very</p>",
        "<p>decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her</p>\n<p>stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an</p>\n<p>instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s</p>\n<p>attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed</p>\n<p>admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was</p>\n<p>obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a</p>\n<p>real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an</p>",
        "<p>engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from</p>\n<p>turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up</p>\n<p>forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The</p>\n<p>thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a</p>\n<p>dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the</p>\n<p>young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor</p>\n<p>for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a</p>",
        "<p>Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something</p>\n<p>happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished</p>\n<p>Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to</p>\n<p>his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen</p>\n<p>to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as</p>\n<p>he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick</p>\n<p>of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I</p>",
        "<p>think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”</p>\n<p>Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had</p>\n<p>been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his</p>\n<p>pale face.</p>\n<p>“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so</p>\n<p>very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are</p>\n<p>breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from</p>",
        "<p>the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself</p>\n<p>open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”</p>\n<p>“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and</p>\n<p>throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved</p>\n<p>punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought</p>\n<p>to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing</p>\n<p>up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not</p>",
        "<p>part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I</p>\n<p>think I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the</p>\n<p>whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps</p>\n<p>upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we</p>\n<p>could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the</p>\n<p>road.</p>\n<p>“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw</p>",
        "<p>himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from</p>\n<p>crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.</p>\n<p>The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”</p>\n<p>“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I</p>\n<p>remarked.</p>\n<p>“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer</p>\n<p>Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was</p>",
        "<p>equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as</p>\n<p>far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men</p>\n<p>were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other</p>\n<p>was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious</p>\n<p>voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My</p>\n<p>suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his</p>\n<p>signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so</p>",
        "<p>familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of</p>\n<p>it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,</p>\n<p>all pointed in the same direction.”</p>\n<p>“And how did you verify them?”</p>\n<p>“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew</p>\n<p>the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed</p>\n<p>description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result</p>",
        "<p>of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to</p>\n<p>the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered</p>\n<p>to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed</p>\n<p>the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at</p>\n<p>his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected,</p>\n<p>his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but</p>\n<p>characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from</p>",
        "<p>Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description</p>\n<p>tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank.</p>\n<p>_Voilà tout_!”</p>\n<p>“And Miss Sutherland?”</p>\n<p>“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old</p>\n<p>Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and</p>\n<p>danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as</p>",
        "<p>much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”</p>",
        "<h3>The Boscombe Valley Mystery</h3>\n<p>IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY</p>\n<p>We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid</p>\n<p>brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:</p>\n<p>“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the</p>\n<p>west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be</p>\n<p>glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave</p>",
        "<p>Paddington by the 11:15.”</p>\n<p>“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “Will you</p>\n<p>go?”</p>\n<p>“I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at</p>\n<p>present.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a</p>\n<p>little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you</p>",
        "<p>are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’ cases.”</p>\n<p>“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one</p>\n<p>of them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I</p>\n<p>have only half an hour.”</p>\n<p>My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect</p>\n<p>of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and</p>\n<p>simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my</p>",
        "<p>valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing</p>\n<p>up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and</p>\n<p>taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.</p>\n<p>“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It makes a</p>\n<p>considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can</p>\n<p>thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.</p>\n<p>If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”</p>",
        "<p>We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers</p>\n<p>which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,</p>\n<p>with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past</p>\n<p>Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and</p>\n<p>tossed them up onto the rack.</p>\n<p>“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”</p>",
        "<p>“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been</p>\n<p>looking through all the recent papers in order to master the</p>\n<p>particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple</p>\n<p>cases which are so extremely difficult.”</p>\n<p>“That sounds a little paradoxical.”</p>\n<p>“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue.</p>\n<p>The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it</p>",
        "<p>is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a</p>\n<p>very serious case against the son of the murdered man.”</p>\n<p>“It is a murder, then?”</p>\n<p>“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted</p>\n<p>until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will</p>\n<p>explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to</p>\n<p>understand it, in a very few words.</p>",
        "<p>“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in</p>\n<p>Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John</p>\n<p>Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to</p>\n<p>the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was</p>\n<p>let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had</p>\n<p>known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that</p>\n<p>when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as</p>",
        "<p>possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his</p>\n<p>tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as</p>\n<p>they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,</p>\n<p>and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them</p>\n<p>had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the</p>\n<p>neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though</p>\n<p>both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the</p>",
        "<p>race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a man</p>\n<p>and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the</p>\n<p>least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the</p>\n<p>families. Now for the facts.</p>\n<p>“On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at</p>\n<p>Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe</p>\n<p>Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream</p>",
        "<p>which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his</p>\n<p>serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he</p>\n<p>must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.</p>\n<p>From that appointment he never came back alive.</p>\n<p>“From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,</p>\n<p>and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old</p>\n<p>woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,</p>",
        "<p>a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose</p>\n<p>that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a</p>\n<p>few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.</p>\n<p>James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the</p>\n<p>best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and</p>\n<p>the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he</p>\n<p>heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.</p>",
        "<p>“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the</p>\n<p>game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded</p>\n<p>round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl</p>\n<p>of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of</p>\n<p>the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.</p>\n<p>She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood</p>\n<p>and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared</p>",
        "<p>to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using</p>\n<p>very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his</p>\n<p>hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their</p>\n<p>violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home</p>\n<p>that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and</p>\n<p>that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said</p>\n<p>the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say</p>",
        "<p>that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help</p>\n<p>of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his</p>\n<p>hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with</p>\n<p>fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out</p>\n<p>upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated</p>\n<p>blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might</p>\n<p>very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which</p>",
        "<p>was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under</p>\n<p>these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict</p>\n<p>of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he</p>\n<p>was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have</p>\n<p>referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the</p>\n<p>case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”</p>\n<p>“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever</p>",
        "<p>circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”</p>\n<p>“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes</p>\n<p>thoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if</p>\n<p>you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in</p>\n<p>an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It</p>\n<p>must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave</p>\n<p>against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the</p>",
        "<p>culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and</p>\n<p>among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who</p>\n<p>believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may</p>\n<p>recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case</p>\n<p>in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case</p>\n<p>to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying</p>\n<p>westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their</p>",
        "<p>breakfasts at home.”</p>\n<p>“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will</p>\n<p>find little credit to be gained out of this case.”</p>\n<p>“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,</p>\n<p>laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts</p>\n<p>which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me</p>\n<p>too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either</p>",
        "<p>confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of</p>\n<p>employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,</p>\n<p>I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the</p>\n<p>right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have</p>\n<p>noted even so self-evident a thing as that.”</p>\n<p>“How on earth—”</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which</p>",
        "<p>characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you</p>\n<p>shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete</p>\n<p>as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively</p>\n<p>slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear</p>\n<p>that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine</p>\n<p>a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being</p>\n<p>satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of</p>",
        "<p>observation and inference. Therein lies my _métier_, and it is just</p>\n<p>possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies</p>\n<p>before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in</p>\n<p>the inquest, and which are worth considering.”</p>\n<p>“What are they?”</p>\n<p>“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the</p>\n<p>return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing</p>",
        "<p>him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to</p>\n<p>hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of</p>\n<p>his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might</p>\n<p>have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”</p>\n<p>“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.</p>\n<p>“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”</p>\n<p>“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least</p>",
        "<p>a most suspicious remark.”</p>\n<p>“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can</p>\n<p>at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could</p>\n<p>not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances</p>\n<p>were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own</p>\n<p>arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as</p>\n<p>highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural</p>",
        "<p>under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to</p>\n<p>a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as</p>\n<p>either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint</p>\n<p>and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not</p>\n<p>unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his</p>\n<p>father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far</p>\n<p>forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,</p>",
        "<p>according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise</p>\n<p>his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which</p>\n<p>are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy</p>\n<p>mind rather than of a guilty one.”</p>\n<p>I shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”</p>\n<p>I remarked.</p>\n<p>“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”</p>",
        "<p>“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”</p>\n<p>“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though</p>\n<p>there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find</p>\n<p>it here, and may read it for yourself.”</p>\n<p>He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,</p>\n<p>and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which</p>\n<p>the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had</p>",
        "<p>occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read</p>\n<p>it very carefully. It ran in this way:</p>\n<p>“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and</p>\n<p>gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at</p>\n<p>Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,</p>\n<p>the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and</p>\n<p>I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John</p>",
        "<p>Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap</p>\n<p>in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk</p>\n<p>rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he</p>\n<p>was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the</p>\n<p>Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which</p>\n<p>is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the</p>\n<p>game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in</p>",
        "<p>thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in</p>\n<p>front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of</p>\n<p>“Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then</p>\n<p>hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be</p>\n<p>much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was</p>\n<p>doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost</p>\n<p>to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that</p>",
        "<p>his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards</p>\n<p>Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I</p>\n<p>heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I</p>\n<p>found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly</p>\n<p>injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost</p>\n<p>instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made</p>\n<p>my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to</p>",
        "<p>ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I</p>\n<p>have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,</p>\n<p>being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far</p>\n<p>as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’</p>\n<p>“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?</p>\n<p>“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion</p>\n<p>to a rat.</p>",
        "<p>“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?</p>\n<p>“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was</p>\n<p>delirious.</p>\n<p>“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had</p>\n<p>this final quarrel?</p>\n<p>“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.</p>\n<p>“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.</p>",
        "<p>“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you</p>\n<p>that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.</p>\n<p>“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to</p>\n<p>you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably</p>\n<p>in any future proceedings which may arise.</p>\n<p>“Witness: I must still refuse.</p>\n<p>“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal</p>",
        "<p>between you and your father?</p>\n<p>“Witness: It was.</p>\n<p>“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,</p>\n<p>and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?</p>\n<p>“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.</p>\n<p>“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you</p>\n<p>returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?</p>",
        "<p>“Witness: Nothing definite.</p>\n<p>“The Coroner: What do you mean?</p>\n<p>“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,</p>\n<p>that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague</p>\n<p>impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the</p>\n<p>left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of</p>\n<p>some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked</p>",
        "<p>round for it, but it was gone.</p>\n<p>“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’</p>\n<p>“‘Yes, it was gone.’</p>\n<p>“‘You cannot say what it was?’</p>\n<p>“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’</p>\n<p>“‘How far from the body?’</p>\n<p>“‘A dozen yards or so.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’</p>\n<p>“‘About the same.’</p>\n<p>“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of</p>\n<p>it?’</p>\n<p>“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’</p>\n<p>“This concluded the examination of the witness.”</p>\n<p>“I see,” said I as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his</p>",
        "<p>concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls</p>\n<p>attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having</p>\n<p>signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details</p>\n<p>of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his</p>\n<p>father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against</p>\n<p>the son.”</p>\n<p>Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the</p>",
        "<p>cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,”</p>\n<p>said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s</p>\n<p>favour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having</p>\n<p>too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent</p>\n<p>a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too</p>\n<p>much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so</p>\n<p>_outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the</p>",
        "<p>vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of</p>\n<p>view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither</p>\n<p>that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and</p>\n<p>not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of</p>\n<p>action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty</p>\n<p>minutes.”</p>\n<p>It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the</p>",
        "<p>beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found</p>\n<p>ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,</p>\n<p>ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the</p>\n<p>platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings</p>\n<p>which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no</p>\n<p>difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove</p>\n<p>to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.</p>",
        "<p>“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.</p>\n<p>“I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until</p>\n<p>you had been on the scene of the crime.”</p>\n<p>“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is</p>\n<p>entirely a question of barometric pressure.”</p>\n<p>Lestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.</p>\n<p>“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the</p>",
        "<p>sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the</p>\n<p>sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do</p>\n<p>not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”</p>\n<p>Lestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your</p>\n<p>conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a</p>\n<p>pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,</p>\n<p>of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.</p>",
        "<p>She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly</p>\n<p>told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not</p>\n<p>already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”</p>\n<p>He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most</p>\n<p>lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes</p>\n<p>shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of</p>\n<p>her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of</p>\n<p>us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my</p>\n<p>companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell</p>\n<p>you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to</p>\n<p>start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon</p>\n<p>that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and</p>\n<p>I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to</p>",
        "<p>hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”</p>\n<p>“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may</p>\n<p>rely upon my doing all that I can.”</p>\n<p>“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do</p>\n<p>you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he</p>\n<p>is innocent?”</p>\n<p>“I think that it is very probable.”</p>",
        "<p>“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly</p>\n<p>at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”</p>\n<p>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has</p>\n<p>been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.</p>\n<p>“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And</p>\n<p>about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he</p>\n<p>would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in</p>",
        "<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“In what way?” asked Holmes.</p>\n<p>“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many</p>\n<p>disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should</p>\n<p>be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as</p>\n<p>brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little</p>\n<p>of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything</p>",
        "<p>like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favour of such a union?”</p>\n<p>“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of</p>\n<p>it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one</p>\n<p>of his keen, questioning glances at her.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I</p>",
        "<p>call to-morrow?”</p>\n<p>“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”</p>\n<p>“The doctor?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years</p>\n<p>back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,</p>\n<p>and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is</p>\n<p>shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the</p>",
        "<p>old days in Victoria.”</p>\n<p>“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, at the mines.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made</p>\n<p>his money.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, certainly.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”</p>",
        "<p>“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go</p>\n<p>to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that</p>\n<p>I know him to be innocent.”</p>\n<p>“I will, Miss Turner.”</p>\n<p>“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I</p>\n<p>leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried</p>\n<p>from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the</p>",
        "<p>wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.</p>\n<p>“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade with dignity after a few</p>\n<p>minutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to</p>\n<p>disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”</p>\n<p>“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Have you an order to see him in prison?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but only for you and me.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still</p>\n<p>time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”</p>\n<p>“Ample.”</p>\n<p>“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but</p>\n<p>I shall only be away a couple of hours.”</p>\n<p>I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the</p>\n<p>streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay</p>",
        "<p>upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.</p>\n<p>The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the</p>\n<p>deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention</p>\n<p>wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung</p>\n<p>it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of</p>\n<p>the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story</p>\n<p>were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely</p>",
        "<p>unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the</p>\n<p>time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by</p>\n<p>his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and</p>\n<p>deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal</p>\n<p>something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the</p>\n<p>weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.</p>\n<p>In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of</p>",
        "<p>the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been</p>\n<p>shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon</p>\n<p>my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.</p>\n<p>That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen</p>\n<p>quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go</p>\n<p>for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the</p>\n<p>blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to</p>",
        "<p>it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could</p>\n<p>that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow</p>\n<p>does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an</p>\n<p>attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I</p>\n<p>cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the</p>\n<p>incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true</p>\n<p>the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his</p>",
        "<p>overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and</p>\n<p>to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back</p>\n<p>turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and</p>\n<p>improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s</p>\n<p>opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I</p>\n<p>could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen</p>\n<p>his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.</p>",
        "<p>It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for</p>\n<p>Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.</p>\n<p>“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down. “It is</p>\n<p>of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the</p>\n<p>ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest</p>\n<p>for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by</p>\n<p>a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”</p>",
        "<p>“And what did you learn from him?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Could he throw no light?”</p>\n<p>“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had</p>\n<p>done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is</p>\n<p>as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,</p>\n<p>though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.”</p>",
        "<p>“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that</p>\n<p>he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss</p>\n<p>Turner.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,</p>\n<p>insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a</p>\n<p>lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at</p>\n<p>a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of</p>",
        "<p>a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a</p>\n<p>word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him</p>\n<p>to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,</p>\n<p>but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of</p>\n<p>this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his</p>\n<p>father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss</p>\n<p>Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and</p>",
        "<p>his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown</p>\n<p>him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife</p>\n<p>that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did</p>\n<p>not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has</p>\n<p>come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers</p>\n<p>that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him</p>\n<p>over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband</p>",
        "<p>already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between</p>\n<p>them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all</p>\n<p>that he has suffered.”</p>\n<p>“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”</p>\n<p>“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.</p>\n<p>One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the</p>\n<p>pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was</p>",
        "<p>away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the</p>\n<p>murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had</p>\n<p>returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And</p>\n<p>now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall</p>\n<p>leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright</p>\n<p>and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the</p>",
        "<p>carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.</p>\n<p>“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said</p>\n<p>that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”</p>\n<p>“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life</p>\n<p>abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business</p>\n<p>has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s,</p>",
        "<p>and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he</p>\n<p>gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about</p>\n<p>here speaks of his kindness to him.”</p>\n<p>“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this</p>\n<p>McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been</p>",
        "<p>under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son</p>\n<p>to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and</p>\n<p>that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a</p>\n<p>proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we</p>\n<p>know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us</p>\n<p>as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”</p>\n<p>“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,</p>",
        "<p>winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without</p>\n<p>flying away after theories and fancies.”</p>\n<p>“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to</p>\n<p>tackle the facts.”</p>\n<p>“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to</p>\n<p>get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.</p>\n<p>“And that is—”</p>",
        "<p>“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all</p>\n<p>theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”</p>\n<p>“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing.</p>\n<p>“But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the</p>\n<p>left.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,</p>\n<p>two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon</p>",
        "<p>the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,</p>\n<p>gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay</p>\n<p>heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’</p>\n<p>request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his</p>\n<p>death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had</p>\n<p>then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight</p>\n<p>different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from</p>",
        "<p>which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as</p>\n<p>this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker</p>\n<p>Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and</p>\n<p>darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his</p>\n<p>eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was</p>\n<p>bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins</p>",
        "<p>stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed</p>\n<p>to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so</p>\n<p>absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or</p>\n<p>remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a</p>\n<p>quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way</p>\n<p>along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the</p>\n<p>woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that</p>",
        "<p>district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and</p>\n<p>amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes</p>\n<p>would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little</p>\n<p>detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective</p>\n<p>indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the</p>\n<p>interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions</p>\n<p>was directed towards a definite end.</p>",
        "<p>The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some</p>\n<p>fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley</p>\n<p>Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods</p>\n<p>which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting</p>\n<p>pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On</p>\n<p>the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was</p>\n<p>a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of</p>",
        "<p>the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the</p>\n<p>exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was</p>\n<p>the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by</p>\n<p>the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager</p>\n<p>face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the</p>\n<p>trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and</p>\n<p>then turned upon my companion.</p>",
        "<p>“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or</p>\n<p>other trace. But how on earth—”</p>\n<p>“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward</p>\n<p>twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it</p>\n<p>vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I</p>\n<p>been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over</p>",
        "<p>it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have</p>\n<p>covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are</p>\n<p>three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay</p>\n<p>down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time</p>\n<p>rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice</p>\n<p>he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply</p>\n<p>marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran</p>",
        "<p>when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet</p>\n<p>as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the</p>\n<p>gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?</p>\n<p>Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,</p>\n<p>they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they</p>\n<p>come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the</p>\n<p>track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the</p>",
        "<p>shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes</p>\n<p>traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon</p>\n<p>his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained</p>\n<p>there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what</p>\n<p>seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens</p>\n<p>not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could</p>\n<p>reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he</p>",
        "<p>carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the</p>\n<p>wood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.</p>\n<p>“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning</p>\n<p>to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must</p>\n<p>be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and</p>\n<p>perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our</p>\n<p>luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”</p>",
        "<p>It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into</p>\n<p>Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up</p>\n<p>in the wood.</p>\n<p>“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The</p>\n<p>murder was done with it.”</p>\n<p>“I see no marks.”</p>\n<p>“There are none.”</p>",
        "<p>“How do you know, then?”</p>\n<p>“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.</p>\n<p>There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds</p>\n<p>with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”</p>\n<p>“And the murderer?”</p>\n<p>“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears</p>\n<p>thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses</p>",
        "<p>a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are</p>\n<p>several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our</p>\n<p>search.”</p>\n<p>Lestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed</p>\n<p>British jury.”</p>\n<p>“_Nous verrons_,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your own method,</p>",
        "<p>and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall</p>\n<p>probably return to London by the evening train.”</p>\n<p>“And leave your case unfinished?”</p>\n<p>“No, finished.”</p>\n<p>“But the mystery?”</p>\n<p>“It is solved.”</p>\n<p>“Who was the criminal, then?”</p>",
        "<p>“The gentleman I describe.”</p>\n<p>“But who is he?”</p>\n<p>“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a</p>\n<p>populous neighbourhood.”</p>\n<p>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said, “and</p>\n<p>I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a</p>\n<p>left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the</p>",
        "<p>laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here</p>\n<p>are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”</p>\n<p>Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we</p>\n<p>found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought</p>\n<p>with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a</p>\n<p>perplexing position.</p>",
        "<p>“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down</p>\n<p>in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t know quite</p>\n<p>what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me</p>\n<p>expound.”</p>\n<p>“Pray do so.”</p>\n<p>“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young</p>\n<p>McCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they</p>",
        "<p>impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that</p>\n<p>his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing</p>\n<p>him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled</p>\n<p>several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s</p>\n<p>ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will</p>\n<p>begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”</p>\n<p>“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as</p>\n<p>far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within</p>\n<p>earshot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it</p>\n<p>was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly</p>\n<p>Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a</p>\n<p>strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him</p>\n<p>at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.”</p>",
        "<p>“What of the rat, then?”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it</p>\n<p>out on the table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I wired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of</p>\n<p>the map. “What do you read?”</p>\n<p>“ARAT,” I read.</p>\n<p>“And now?” He raised his hand.</p>",
        "<p>“BALLARAT.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only</p>\n<p>caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his</p>\n<p>murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.”</p>\n<p>“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.</p>\n<p>“It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down</p>\n<p>considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,</p>",
        "<p>granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have</p>\n<p>come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an</p>\n<p>Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly.”</p>\n<p>“And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be</p>\n<p>approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly</p>\n<p>wander.”</p>",
        "<p>“Quite so.”</p>\n<p>“Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I</p>\n<p>gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as</p>\n<p>to the personality of the criminal.”</p>\n<p>“But how did you gain them?”</p>\n<p>“You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.”</p>\n<p>“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his</p>",
        "<p>stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”</p>\n<p>“But his lameness?”</p>\n<p>“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his</p>\n<p>left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”</p>\n<p>“But his left-handedness.”</p>\n<p>“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by</p>",
        "<p>the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately</p>\n<p>behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it</p>\n<p>were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the</p>\n<p>interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found</p>\n<p>the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables</p>\n<p>me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some</p>\n<p>attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140</p>",
        "<p>different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found</p>\n<p>the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss</p>\n<p>where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which</p>\n<p>are rolled in Rotterdam.”</p>\n<p>“And the cigar-holder?”</p>\n<p>“I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used</p>\n<p>a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not</p>",
        "<p>a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.”</p>\n<p>“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he</p>\n<p>cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if</p>\n<p>you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in</p>\n<p>which all this points. The culprit is—”</p>\n<p>“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our</p>\n<p>sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.</p>",
        "<p>The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,</p>\n<p>limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,</p>\n<p>and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs</p>\n<p>showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of</p>\n<p>character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping</p>\n<p>eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his</p>\n<p>appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the</p>",
        "<p>corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear</p>\n<p>to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic</p>\n<p>disease.</p>\n<p>“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes gently. “You had my note?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see</p>\n<p>me here to avoid scandal.”</p>\n<p>“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”</p>",
        "<p>“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with</p>\n<p>despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is</p>\n<p>so. I know all about McCarthy.”</p>\n<p>The old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I</p>\n<p>would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that</p>\n<p>I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes gravely.</p>\n<p>“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would</p>\n<p>break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am</p>\n<p>arrested.”</p>\n<p>“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“What?”</p>\n<p>“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who</p>",
        "<p>required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young</p>\n<p>McCarthy must be got off, however.”</p>\n<p>“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My</p>\n<p>doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would</p>\n<p>rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”</p>\n<p>Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a</p>\n<p>bundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I shall</p>",
        "<p>jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.</p>\n<p>Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save</p>\n<p>young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is</p>\n<p>absolutely needed.”</p>\n<p>“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live</p>\n<p>to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare</p>\n<p>Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has</p>",
        "<p>been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.</p>\n<p>“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I</p>\n<p>tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.</p>\n<p>His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my</p>\n<p>life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.</p>\n<p>“It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then,</p>\n<p>hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got</p>",
        "<p>among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to</p>\n<p>the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway</p>\n<p>robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,</p>\n<p>sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the</p>\n<p>road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,</p>\n<p>and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.</p>\n<p>“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay</p>",
        "<p>in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,</p>\n<p>so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the</p>\n<p>first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the</p>\n<p>swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this</p>\n<p>very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I</p>\n<p>spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as</p>\n<p>though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became</p>",
        "<p>wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.</p>\n<p>There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a</p>\n<p>quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be</p>\n<p>in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to</p>\n<p>make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and</p>\n<p>though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when</p>\n<p>she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path</p>",
        "<p>as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and</p>\n<p>did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy</p>\n<p>laid his grip upon me.</p>\n<p>“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent</p>\n<p>Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.</p>\n<p>“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as</p>\n<p>good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can</p>",
        "<p>have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country</p>\n<p>is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’</p>\n<p>“Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them</p>\n<p>off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.</p>\n<p>There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I</p>\n<p>would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse</p>\n<p>as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my</p>",
        "<p>past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever</p>\n<p>it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last</p>\n<p>he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.</p>\n<p>“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known</p>\n<p>to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad</p>\n<p>should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not</p>\n<p>have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to</p>",
        "<p>the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.</p>\n<p>McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at</p>\n<p>the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.</p>\n<p>“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a</p>\n<p>cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I</p>\n<p>listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come</p>\n<p>uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little</p>",
        "<p>regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the</p>\n<p>streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear</p>\n<p>should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the</p>\n<p>bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind</p>\n<p>and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my</p>\n<p>memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that</p>\n<p>foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I</p>",
        "<p>have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that</p>\n<p>my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more</p>\n<p>than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if</p>\n<p>he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;</p>\n<p>but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back</p>\n<p>to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true</p>\n<p>story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes as the old man</p>\n<p>signed the statement which had been drawn out. “I pray that we may</p>\n<p>never be exposed to such a temptation.”</p>\n<p>“I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?”</p>\n<p>“In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will</p>\n<p>soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I</p>\n<p>will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be</p>",
        "<p>forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and</p>\n<p>your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”</p>\n<p>“Farewell, then,” said the old man solemnly. “Your own deathbeds, when</p>\n<p>they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you</p>\n<p>have given to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he</p>\n<p>stumbled slowly from the room.</p>\n<p>“God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does fate play</p>",
        "<p>such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as</p>\n<p>this that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for</p>\n<p>the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”</p>\n<p>James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number</p>\n<p>of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the</p>\n<p>defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our</p>\n<p>interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son</p>",
        "<p>and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the</p>\n<p>black cloud which rests upon their past.</p>"

        "<h3>The Five Orange Pips</h3>\n<p>V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS</p>\n<p>When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases</p>\n<p>between the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present</p>\n<p>strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know</p>\n<p>which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained</p>\n<p>publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for</p>",
        "<p>those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,</p>\n<p>and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too,</p>\n<p>have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,</p>\n<p>beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially</p>\n<p>cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture</p>\n<p>and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to</p>\n<p>him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in</p>",
        "<p>its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give</p>\n<p>some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in</p>\n<p>connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,</p>\n<p>entirely cleared up.</p>\n<p>The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or</p>\n<p>less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under</p>\n<p>this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the</p>",
        "<p>Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious</p>\n<p>club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts</p>\n<p>connected with the loss of the British barque _Sophy Anderson_, of the</p>\n<p>singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and</p>\n<p>finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be</p>\n<p>remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s</p>\n<p>watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that</p>",
        "<p>therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction</p>\n<p>which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these</p>\n<p>I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such</p>\n<p>singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have</p>\n<p>now taken up my pen to describe.</p>\n<p>It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had</p>\n<p>set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the</p>",
        "<p>rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of</p>\n<p>great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the</p>\n<p>instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those</p>\n<p>great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his</p>\n<p>civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the</p>\n<p>storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a</p>\n<p>child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the</p>",
        "<p>fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was</p>\n<p>deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the</p>\n<p>gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the</p>\n<p>rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was</p>\n<p>on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once</p>\n<p>more in my old quarters at Baker Street.</p>\n<p>“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell.</p>",
        "<p>Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage</p>\n<p>visitors.”</p>\n<p>“A client, then?”</p>\n<p>“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on</p>\n<p>such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to</p>\n<p>be some crony of the landlady’s.”</p>",
        "<p>Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a</p>\n<p>step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his</p>\n<p>long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant</p>\n<p>chair upon which a newcomer must sit.</p>\n<p>“Come in!” said he.</p>\n<p>The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,</p>\n<p>well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy</p>",
        "<p>in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and</p>\n<p>his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he</p>\n<p>had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I</p>\n<p>could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a</p>\n<p>man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.</p>\n<p>“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his</p>\n<p>eyes. “I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some</p>",
        "<p>traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”</p>\n<p>“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here on</p>\n<p>the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the</p>\n<p>south-west, I see.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, from Horsham.”</p>\n<p>“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite</p>\n<p>distinctive.”</p>",
        "<p>“I have come for advice.”</p>\n<p>“That is easily got.”</p>\n<p>“And help.”</p>\n<p>“That is not always so easy.”</p>\n<p>“I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how</p>\n<p>you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”</p>",
        "<p>“He said that you could solve anything.”</p>\n<p>“He said too much.”</p>\n<p>“That you are never beaten.”</p>\n<p>“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a</p>\n<p>woman.”</p>\n<p>“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”</p>\n<p>“It is true that I have been generally successful.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then you may be so with me.”</p>\n<p>“I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with</p>\n<p>some details as to your case.”</p>\n<p>“It is no ordinary one.”</p>\n<p>“None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”</p>\n<p>“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have</p>\n<p>ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events</p>",
        "<p>than those which have happened in my own family.”</p>\n<p>“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes. “Pray give us the essential</p>\n<p>facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to</p>\n<p>those details which seem to me to be most important.”</p>\n<p>The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards</p>\n<p>the blaze.</p>\n<p>“My name,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far</p>",
        "<p>as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a</p>\n<p>hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must</p>\n<p>go back to the commencement of the affair.</p>\n<p>“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my</p>\n<p>father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he</p>\n<p>enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee</p>\n<p>of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such</p>",
        "<p>success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome</p>\n<p>competence.</p>\n<p>“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became</p>\n<p>a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At</p>\n<p>the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under</p>\n<p>Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my</p>\n<p>uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four</p>",
        "<p>years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small</p>\n<p>estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune</p>\n<p>in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the</p>\n<p>negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the</p>\n<p>franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered,</p>\n<p>very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring</p>\n<p>disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if</p>",
        "<p>ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields</p>\n<p>round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very</p>\n<p>often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great</p>\n<p>deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and</p>\n<p>did not want any friends, not even his own brother.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time</p>\n<p>when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be</p>",
        "<p>in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He</p>\n<p>begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in</p>\n<p>his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and</p>\n<p>draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the</p>\n<p>servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was</p>\n<p>sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could</p>\n<p>go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him</p>",
        "<p>in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a</p>\n<p>single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably</p>\n<p>locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to</p>\n<p>enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I</p>\n<p>was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and</p>\n<p>bundles as would be expected in such a room.</p>\n<p>“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon</p>",
        "<p>the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing</p>\n<p>for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,</p>\n<p>and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it</p>\n<p>up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out</p>\n<p>there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon</p>\n<p>his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my</p>\n<p>lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were</p>",
        "<p>protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope</p>\n<p>which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and</p>\n<p>then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’</p>\n<p>“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.</p>\n<p>“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,</p>\n<p>leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw</p>\n<p>scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter</p>",
        "<p>K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried</p>\n<p>pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the</p>\n<p>breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with</p>\n<p>an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,</p>\n<p>and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.</p>\n<p>“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he</p>\n<p>with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,</p>",
        "<p>and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’</p>\n<p>“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step</p>\n<p>up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there</p>\n<p>was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass</p>\n<p>box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,</p>\n<p>with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had</p>\n<p>read in the morning upon the envelope.</p>",
        "<p>“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my</p>\n<p>estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my</p>\n<p>brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you</p>\n<p>can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my</p>\n<p>advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to</p>\n<p>give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are</p>\n<p>going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’</p>",
        "<p>“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.</p>\n<p>The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression</p>\n<p>upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind</p>\n<p>without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off</p>\n<p>the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation</p>\n<p>grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the</p>\n<p>usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however.</p>",
        "<p>He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of</p>\n<p>society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door</p>\n<p>locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of</p>\n<p>drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the</p>\n<p>garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of</p>\n<p>no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by</p>\n<p>man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush</p>",
        "<p>tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man</p>\n<p>who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the</p>\n<p>roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold</p>\n<p>day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.</p>\n<p>“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse</p>\n<p>your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken</p>\n<p>sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to</p>",
        "<p>search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay</p>\n<p>at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the</p>\n<p>water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his</p>\n<p>known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew</p>\n<p>how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade</p>\n<p>myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,</p>\n<p>however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of</p>",
        "<p>some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”</p>\n<p>“One moment,” Holmes interposed, “your statement is, I foresee, one of</p>\n<p>the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date</p>\n<p>of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his</p>\n<p>supposed suicide.”</p>\n<p>“The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,</p>\n<p>upon the night of May 2nd.”</p>",
        "<p>“Thank you. Pray proceed.”</p>\n<p>“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made</p>\n<p>a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We</p>\n<p>found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On</p>\n<p>the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.</p>\n<p>K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’</p>\n<p>written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers</p>",
        "<p>which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was</p>\n<p>nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered</p>\n<p>papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of</p>\n<p>them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and</p>\n<p>had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during</p>\n<p>the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned</p>\n<p>with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the</p>",
        "<p>carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.</p>\n<p>“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at</p>\n<p>Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of</p>\n<p>’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a</p>\n<p>sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There</p>\n<p>he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried</p>\n<p>orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always</p>",
        "<p>laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but</p>\n<p>he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon</p>\n<p>himself.</p>\n<p>“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.</p>\n<p>“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.</p>\n<p>“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the</p>\n<p>very letters. But what is this written above them?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.</p>\n<p>“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the</p>\n<p>papers must be those that are destroyed.’</p>\n<p>“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised</p>\n<p>land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the</p>\n<p>thing come from?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.</p>\n<p>“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with</p>\n<p>sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’</p>\n<p>“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.</p>\n<p>“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’</p>\n<p>“‘Then let me do so?’</p>\n<p>“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’</p>",
        "<p>“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I</p>\n<p>went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.</p>\n<p>“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from</p>\n<p>home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command</p>\n<p>of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,</p>\n<p>for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away</p>\n<p>from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his</p>",
        "<p>absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at</p>\n<p>once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound</p>\n<p>in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.</p>\n<p>I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his</p>\n<p>consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in</p>\n<p>the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit</p>\n<p>unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death</p>",
        "<p>from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected</p>\n<p>with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the</p>\n<p>idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no</p>\n<p>robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And</p>\n<p>yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I</p>\n<p>was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.</p>\n<p>“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I</p>",
        "<p>did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our</p>\n<p>troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s</p>\n<p>life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in</p>\n<p>another.</p>\n<p>“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years</p>\n<p>and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived</p>\n<p>happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed</p>",
        "<p>away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I</p>\n<p>had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow</p>\n<p>fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”</p>\n<p>The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning</p>\n<p>to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.</p>\n<p>“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The postmark is London—eastern</p>\n<p>division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last</p>",
        "<p>message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”</p>\n<p>“What have you done?” asked Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Nothing?”</p>\n<p>“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I have</p>\n<p>felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the</p>\n<p>snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some</p>",
        "<p>resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can</p>\n<p>guard against.”</p>\n<p>“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost.</p>\n<p>Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”</p>\n<p>“I have seen the police.”</p>\n<p>“Ah!”</p>\n<p>“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the</p>",
        "<p>inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical</p>\n<p>jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as</p>\n<p>the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”</p>\n<p>Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he</p>\n<p>cried.</p>\n<p>“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the</p>\n<p>house with me.”</p>",
        "<p>“Has he come with you to-night?”</p>\n<p>“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”</p>\n<p>Again Holmes raved in the air.</p>\n<p>“Why did you come to me?” he said, “and, above all, why did you not</p>\n<p>come at once?”</p>\n<p>“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast</p>\n<p>about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.”</p>",
        "<p>“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted</p>\n<p>before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which</p>\n<p>you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”</p>\n<p>“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat</p>\n<p>pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he</p>\n<p>laid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that</p>\n<p>on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,</p>",
        "<p>unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular</p>\n<p>colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am</p>\n<p>inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,</p>\n<p>fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped</p>\n<p>destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us</p>\n<p>much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The</p>\n<p>writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”</p>",
        "<p>Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which</p>\n<p>showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It</p>\n<p>was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical</p>\n<p>notices:</p>\n<p>“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.</p>\n<p>“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.</p>\n<p>Augustine.</p>",
        "<p>“9th. McCauley cleared.</p>\n<p>“10th. John Swain cleared.</p>\n<p>“12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you!” said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our</p>\n<p>visitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We</p>\n<p>cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get</p>\n<p>home instantly and act.”</p>",
        "<p>“What shall I do?”</p>\n<p>“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put</p>\n<p>this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which</p>\n<p>you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the</p>\n<p>other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one</p>\n<p>which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry</p>\n<p>conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box</p>",
        "<p>out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?”</p>\n<p>“Entirely.”</p>\n<p>“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think</p>\n<p>that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to</p>\n<p>weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to</p>\n<p>remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear</p>\n<p>up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.”</p>",
        "<p>“I thank you,” said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.</p>\n<p>“You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you</p>\n<p>advise.”</p>\n<p>“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the</p>\n<p>meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are</p>\n<p>threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”</p>\n<p>“By train from Waterloo.”</p>",
        "<p>“It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you</p>\n<p>may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”</p>\n<p>“I am armed.”</p>\n<p>“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”</p>\n<p>“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”</p>\n<p>“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”</p>\n<p>“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to</p>",
        "<p>the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.”</p>\n<p>He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still</p>\n<p>screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This</p>\n<p>strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad</p>\n<p>elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to</p>\n<p>have been reabsorbed by them once more.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk</p>",
        "<p>forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit</p>\n<p>his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings</p>\n<p>as they chased each other up to the ceiling.</p>\n<p>“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have</p>\n<p>had none more fantastic than this.”</p>\n<p>“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”</p>\n<p>“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me</p>",
        "<p>to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”</p>\n<p>“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what</p>\n<p>these perils are?”</p>\n<p>“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.</p>\n<p>“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this</p>\n<p>unhappy family?”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of</p>",
        "<p>his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he</p>\n<p>remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its</p>\n<p>bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up</p>\n<p>to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier</p>\n<p>could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a</p>\n<p>single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in</p>\n<p>a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other</p>",
        "<p>ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which</p>\n<p>the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study</p>\n<p>which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of</p>\n<p>their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is</p>\n<p>necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts</p>\n<p>which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you</p>\n<p>will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these</p>",
        "<p>days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare</p>\n<p>accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should</p>\n<p>possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,</p>\n<p>and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,</p>\n<p>you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my</p>\n<p>limits in a very precise fashion.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy,</p>",
        "<p>astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany</p>\n<p>variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region</p>\n<p>within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,</p>\n<p>sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,</p>\n<p>swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I</p>\n<p>think, were the main points of my analysis.”</p>\n<p>Holmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said</p>",
        "<p>then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all</p>\n<p>the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in</p>\n<p>the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.</p>\n<p>Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us</p>\n<p>to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me</p>\n<p>down the letter K of the _American Encyclopædia_ which stands upon the</p>\n<p>shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see</p>",
        "<p>what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a</p>\n<p>strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason</p>\n<p>for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their</p>\n<p>habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the</p>\n<p>lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude</p>\n<p>in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or</p>\n<p>something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of</p>",
        "<p>someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he</p>\n<p>feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters</p>\n<p>which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the</p>\n<p>postmarks of those letters?”</p>\n<p>“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third</p>\n<p>from London.”</p>\n<p>“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”</p>",
        "<p>“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”</p>\n<p>“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the</p>\n<p>probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a</p>\n<p>ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of</p>\n<p>Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,</p>\n<p>in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest</p>\n<p>anything?”</p>",
        "<p>“A greater distance to travel.”</p>\n<p>“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”</p>\n<p>“Then I do not see the point.”</p>\n<p>“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or</p>\n<p>men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their</p>\n<p>singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.</p>\n<p>You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from</p>",
        "<p>Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have</p>\n<p>arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven</p>\n<p>weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the</p>\n<p>difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the</p>\n<p>sailing vessel which brought the writer.”</p>\n<p>“It is possible.”</p>\n<p>“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of</p>",
        "<p>this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has</p>\n<p>always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to</p>\n<p>travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we</p>\n<p>cannot count upon delay.”</p>\n<p>“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”</p>\n<p>“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to</p>\n<p>the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite</p>",
        "<p>clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not</p>\n<p>have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s</p>\n<p>jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men</p>\n<p>of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the</p>\n<p>holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be</p>\n<p>the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.”</p>\n<p>“But of what society?”</p>",
        "<p>“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his</p>\n<p>voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”</p>\n<p>“I never have.”</p>\n<p>Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it is,”</p>\n<p>said he presently:</p>\n<p>“‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the</p>\n<p>sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was</p>",
        "<p>formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the</p>\n<p>Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of</p>\n<p>the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,</p>\n<p>and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for</p>\n<p>the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from</p>\n<p>the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were</p>\n<p>usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic</p>",
        "<p>but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,</p>\n<p>melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim</p>\n<p>might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the</p>\n<p>country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon</p>\n<p>him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was</p>\n<p>the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that</p>\n<p>there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving</p>",
        "<p>it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to</p>\n<p>the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite</p>\n<p>of the efforts of the United States government and of the better</p>\n<p>classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869,</p>\n<p>the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been</p>\n<p>sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’</p>\n<p>“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the</p>",
        "<p>sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance</p>\n<p>of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause</p>\n<p>and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the</p>\n<p>more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this</p>\n<p>register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,</p>\n<p>and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is</p>\n<p>recovered.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then the page we have seen—”</p>\n<p>“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the</p>\n<p>pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then</p>\n<p>there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,</p>\n<p>and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.</p>\n<p>Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,</p>\n<p>and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime</p>",
        "<p>is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to</p>\n<p>be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget</p>\n<p>for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable</p>\n<p>ways of our fellow men.”</p>\n<p>It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued</p>\n<p>brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.</p>",
        "<p>“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I have, I</p>\n<p>foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young</p>\n<p>Openshaw’s.”</p>\n<p>“What steps will you take?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may</p>\n<p>have to go down to Horsham, after all.”</p>\n<p>“You will not go there first?”</p>",
        "<p>“No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid</p>\n<p>will bring up your coffee.”</p>\n<p>As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced</p>\n<p>my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my</p>\n<p>heart.</p>\n<p>“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”</p>\n<p>“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How was it</p>",
        "<p>done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.</p>\n<p>“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near</p>\n<p>Waterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:</p>\n<p>“‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H</p>\n<p>Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a</p>\n<p>splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,</p>\n<p>so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite</p>",
        "<p>impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by</p>\n<p>the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It</p>\n<p>proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from</p>\n<p>an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose</p>\n<p>residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been</p>\n<p>hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that</p>\n<p>in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked</p>",
        "<p>over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.</p>\n<p>The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt</p>\n<p>that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which</p>\n<p>should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to</p>\n<p>the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’”</p>\n<p>We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken</p>\n<p>than I had ever seen him.</p>",
        "<p>“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said at last. “It is a petty feeling,</p>\n<p>no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me</p>\n<p>now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.</p>\n<p>That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to</p>\n<p>his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in</p>\n<p>uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a</p>\n<p>nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.</p>",
        "<p>“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed at last. “How could they</p>\n<p>have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line</p>\n<p>to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a</p>\n<p>night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in</p>\n<p>the long run. I am going out now!”</p>\n<p>“To the police?”</p>\n<p>“No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take</p>",
        "<p>the flies, but not before.”</p>\n<p>All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the</p>\n<p>evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come</p>\n<p>back yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and</p>\n<p>worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf</p>\n<p>he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of</p>\n<p>water.</p>",
        "<p>“You are hungry,” I remarked.</p>\n<p>“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since</p>\n<p>breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Nothing?”</p>\n<p>“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”</p>\n<p>“And how have you succeeded?”</p>\n<p>“Well.”</p>",
        "<p>“You have a clue?”</p>\n<p>“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long</p>\n<p>remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark</p>\n<p>upon them. It is well thought of!”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?”</p>\n<p>He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he</p>\n<p>squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust</p>",
        "<p>them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J.</p>\n<p>O.” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun,</p>\n<p>Barque _Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.”</p>\n<p>“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may</p>\n<p>give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his</p>\n<p>fate as Openshaw did before him.”</p>\n<p>“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”</p>",
        "<p>“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”</p>\n<p>“How did you trace it, then?”</p>\n<p>He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates</p>\n<p>and names.</p>\n<p>“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and</p>\n<p>files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel</p>\n<p>which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were</p>",
        "<p>thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those</p>\n<p>months. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my</p>\n<p>attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from</p>\n<p>London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the</p>\n<p>Union.”</p>\n<p>“Texas, I think.”</p>\n<p>“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an</p>",
        "<p>American origin.”</p>\n<p>“What then?”</p>\n<p>“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _Lone</p>\n<p>Star_ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I</p>\n<p>then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of</p>\n<p>London.”</p>\n<p>“Yes?”</p>",
        "<p>“The _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert</p>\n<p>Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide</p>\n<p>this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and</p>\n<p>learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly</p>\n<p>I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from</p>\n<p>the Isle of Wight.”</p>\n<p>“What will you do, then?”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the</p>\n<p>only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and</p>\n<p>Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last</p>\n<p>night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By</p>\n<p>the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will</p>\n<p>have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police</p>\n<p>of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a</p>",
        "<p>charge of murder.”</p>\n<p>There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the</p>\n<p>murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which</p>\n<p>would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,</p>\n<p>was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial</p>\n<p>gales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone Star_ of</p>\n<p>Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere</p>",
        "<p>far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen</p>\n<p>swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved upon</p>\n<p>it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _Lone</p>\n<p>Star_.</p>",
        "<h3>The Man with the Twisted Lip</h3>\n<p>VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP</p>\n<p>Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the</p>\n<p>Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The</p>\n<p>habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he</p>\n<p>was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams</p>\n<p>and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt</p>",
        "<p>to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that</p>\n<p>the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years</p>\n<p>he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and</p>\n<p>pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,</p>\n<p>pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a</p>\n<p>chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.</p>\n<p>One night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the</p>",
        "<p>hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up</p>\n<p>in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made</p>\n<p>a little face of disappointment.</p>\n<p>“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”</p>\n<p>I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.</p>\n<p>We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon</p>\n<p>the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some</p>",
        "<p>dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.</p>\n<p>“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly</p>\n<p>losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my</p>\n<p>wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!”</p>\n<p>she cried; “I do so want a little help.”</p>\n<p>“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you</p>\n<p>startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”</p>",
        "<p>“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always</p>\n<p>the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a</p>\n<p>lighthouse.</p>\n<p>“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and</p>\n<p>water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you</p>\n<p>rather that I sent James off to bed?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa.</p>",
        "<p>He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!”</p>\n<p>It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s</p>\n<p>trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school</p>\n<p>companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.</p>\n<p>Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring</p>\n<p>him back to her?</p>\n<p>It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he</p>",
        "<p>had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest</p>\n<p>east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one</p>\n<p>day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But</p>\n<p>now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay</p>\n<p>there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison</p>\n<p>or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of</p>\n<p>it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do?</p>",
        "<p>How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place</p>\n<p>and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?</p>\n<p>There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.</p>\n<p>Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,</p>\n<p>why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as</p>\n<p>such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were</p>\n<p>alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab</p>",
        "<p>within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given</p>\n<p>me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery</p>\n<p>sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a</p>\n<p>strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only</p>\n<p>could show how strange it was to be.</p>\n<p>But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.</p>\n<p>Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves</p>",
        "<p>which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.</p>\n<p>Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of</p>\n<p>steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the</p>\n<p>den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down</p>\n<p>the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken</p>\n<p>feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found</p>\n<p>the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with</p>",
        "<p>the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the</p>\n<p>forecastle of an emigrant ship.</p>\n<p>Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in</p>\n<p>strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown</p>\n<p>back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,</p>\n<p>lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows</p>\n<p>there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as</p>",
        "<p>the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The</p>\n<p>most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked</p>\n<p>together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming</p>\n<p>in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling</p>\n<p>out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his</p>\n<p>neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal,</p>\n<p>beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old</p>",
        "<p>man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his</p>\n<p>knees, staring into the fire.</p>\n<p>As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for</p>\n<p>me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.</p>\n<p>“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of</p>\n<p>mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”</p>\n<p>There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering</p>",
        "<p>through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring</p>\n<p>out at me.</p>\n<p>“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,</p>\n<p>with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”</p>\n<p>“Nearly eleven.”</p>\n<p>“Of what day?”</p>\n<p>“Of Friday, June 19th.”</p>",
        "<p>“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you</p>\n<p>want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms and began</p>\n<p>to sob in a high treble key.</p>\n<p>“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two</p>\n<p>days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”</p>\n<p>“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few</p>\n<p>hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with</p>",
        "<p>you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have</p>\n<p>you a cab?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I have one waiting.”</p>\n<p>“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,</p>\n<p>Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.”</p>\n<p>I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,</p>\n<p>holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,</p>",
        "<p>and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by</p>\n<p>the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice</p>\n<p>whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell</p>\n<p>quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come</p>\n<p>from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,</p>\n<p>very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down</p>\n<p>from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude</p>",
        "<p>from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all</p>\n<p>my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of</p>\n<p>astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.</p>\n<p>His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had</p>\n<p>regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my</p>\n<p>surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion</p>\n<p>to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round</p>",
        "<p>to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped</p>\n<p>senility.</p>\n<p>“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”</p>\n<p>“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would</p>\n<p>have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I</p>\n<p>should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”</p>\n<p>“I have a cab outside.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he</p>\n<p>appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you</p>\n<p>also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have</p>\n<p>thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with</p>\n<p>you in five minutes.”</p>\n<p>It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’ requests, for they</p>\n<p>were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet</p>",
        "<p>air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in</p>\n<p>the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I</p>\n<p>could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in</p>\n<p>one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his</p>\n<p>existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s bill,</p>\n<p>led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a</p>\n<p>very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I</p>",
        "<p>was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he</p>\n<p>shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing</p>\n<p>quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit</p>\n<p>of laughter.</p>\n<p>“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added</p>\n<p>opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little</p>\n<p>weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.”</p>",
        "<p>“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”</p>\n<p>“But not more so than I to find you.”</p>\n<p>“I came to find a friend.”</p>\n<p>“And I to find an enemy.”</p>\n<p>“An enemy?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.</p>\n<p>Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I</p>",
        "<p>have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as</p>\n<p>I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would</p>\n<p>not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now</p>\n<p>for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to</p>\n<p>have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that</p>\n<p>building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some</p>\n<p>strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”</p>",
        "<p>“What! You do not mean bodies?”</p>\n<p>“Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every</p>\n<p>poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest</p>\n<p>murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair</p>\n<p>has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.” He</p>\n<p>put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal</p>\n<p>which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed</p>",
        "<p>shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.</p>\n<p>“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the</p>\n<p>gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side</p>\n<p>lanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”</p>\n<p>“If I can be of use.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.</p>\n<p>My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.”</p>",
        "<p>“The Cedars?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct</p>\n<p>the inquiry.”</p>\n<p>“Where is it, then?”</p>\n<p>“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”</p>\n<p>“But I am all in the dark.”</p>\n<p>“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.</p>",
        "<p>All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out</p>\n<p>for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”</p>\n<p>He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the</p>\n<p>endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened</p>\n<p>gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with</p>\n<p>the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull</p>\n<p>wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,</p>",
        "<p>regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some</p>\n<p>belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the</p>\n<p>sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts</p>\n<p>of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his</p>\n<p>breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside</p>\n<p>him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax</p>\n<p>his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of</p>",
        "<p>his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to</p>\n<p>the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,</p>\n<p>shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who</p>\n<p>has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.</p>\n<p>“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you</p>\n<p>quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for</p>\n<p>me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not</p>",
        "<p>over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little</p>\n<p>woman to-night when she meets me at the door.”</p>\n<p>“You forget that I know nothing about it.”</p>\n<p>“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get</p>\n<p>to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to</p>\n<p>go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of</p>\n<p>it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,</p>",
        "<p>Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”</p>\n<p>“Proceed, then.”</p>\n<p>“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a</p>\n<p>gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of</p>\n<p>money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and</p>\n<p>lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the</p>\n<p>neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,</p>",
        "<p>by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was</p>\n<p>interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the</p>\n<p>morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St.</p>\n<p>Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a</p>\n<p>good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with</p>\n<p>all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,</p>\n<p>as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10_s_., while</p>",
        "<p>he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.</p>\n<p>There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been</p>\n<p>weighing upon his mind.</p>\n<p>“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than</p>\n<p>usual, remarking before he started that he had two important</p>\n<p>commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a</p>\n<p>box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram</p>",
        "<p>upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect</p>\n<p>that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting</p>\n<p>was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.</p>\n<p>Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office</p>\n<p>of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam</p>\n<p>Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,</p>\n<p>started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s</p>",
        "<p>office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking</p>\n<p>through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed</p>\n<p>me so far?”</p>\n<p>“It is very clear.”</p>\n<p>“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair</p>\n<p>walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did</p>\n<p>not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was</p>",
        "<p>walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an</p>\n<p>ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down</p>\n<p>at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor</p>\n<p>window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she</p>\n<p>describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to</p>\n<p>her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to</p>\n<p>her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from</p>",
        "<p>behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that</p>\n<p>although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he</p>\n<p>had on neither collar nor necktie.</p>\n<p>“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the</p>\n<p>steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you</p>\n<p>found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to</p>\n<p>ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the</p>",
        "<p>stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,</p>\n<p>who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,</p>\n<p>pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts</p>\n<p>and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in</p>\n<p>Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their</p>\n<p>way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and</p>\n<p>in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their</p>",
        "<p>way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no</p>\n<p>sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one</p>\n<p>to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,</p>\n<p>made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one</p>\n<p>else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was</p>\n<p>their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to</p>\n<p>believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she</p>",
        "<p>sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid</p>\n<p>from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy</p>\n<p>which he had promised to bring home.</p>\n<p>“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,</p>\n<p>made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were</p>\n<p>carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The</p>\n<p>front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small</p>",
        "<p>bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between</p>\n<p>the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low</p>\n<p>tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of</p>\n<p>water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On</p>\n<p>examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and</p>\n<p>several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the</p>\n<p>bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the</p>",
        "<p>clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His</p>\n<p>boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no</p>\n<p>signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other</p>\n<p>traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently</p>\n<p>have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous</p>\n<p>bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save</p>\n<p>himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment</p>",
        "<p>of the tragedy.</p>\n<p>“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in</p>\n<p>the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,</p>\n<p>but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the</p>\n<p>foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance</p>\n<p>at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the</p>\n<p>crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that</p>",
        "<p>he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and</p>\n<p>that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing</p>\n<p>gentleman’s clothes.</p>\n<p>“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives</p>\n<p>upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last</p>\n<p>human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh</p>\n<p>Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who</p>",
        "<p>goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to</p>\n<p>avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax</p>\n<p>vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the</p>\n<p>left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in</p>\n<p>the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,</p>\n<p>cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a</p>\n<p>piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy</p>",
        "<p>leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the</p>\n<p>fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional</p>\n<p>acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has</p>\n<p>reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that</p>\n<p>no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a</p>\n<p>pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has</p>\n<p>turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair</p>",
        "<p>of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the</p>\n<p>colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of</p>\n<p>mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply</p>\n<p>to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.</p>\n<p>This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium</p>\n<p>den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are</p>\n<p>in quest.”</p>",
        "<p>“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done single-handed against</p>\n<p>a man in the prime of life?”</p>\n<p>“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other</p>\n<p>respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your</p>\n<p>medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is</p>\n<p>often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”</p>\n<p>“Pray continue your narrative.”</p>",
        "<p>“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,</p>\n<p>and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could</p>\n<p>be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who</p>\n<p>had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the</p>\n<p>premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the</p>\n<p>matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as</p>\n<p>he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated</p>",
        "<p>with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he</p>\n<p>was seized and searched, without anything being found which could</p>\n<p>incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his</p>\n<p>right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been</p>\n<p>cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,</p>\n<p>adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the</p>\n<p>stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same</p>",
        "<p>source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair</p>\n<p>and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a</p>\n<p>mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that</p>\n<p>she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she</p>\n<p>must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly</p>\n<p>protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon</p>\n<p>the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh</p>",
        "<p>clue.</p>\n<p>“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had</p>\n<p>feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.</p>\n<p>Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think</p>\n<p>they found in the pockets?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot imagine.”</p>\n<p>“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies</p>",
        "<p>and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder</p>\n<p>that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a</p>\n<p>different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the</p>\n<p>house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when</p>\n<p>the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”</p>\n<p>“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.</p>\n<p>Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”</p>",
        "<p>“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that</p>\n<p>this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there</p>\n<p>is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?</p>\n<p>It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the</p>\n<p>tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of</p>\n<p>throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not</p>\n<p>sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when</p>",
        "<p>the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard</p>\n<p>from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.</p>\n<p>There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,</p>\n<p>where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all</p>\n<p>the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure</p>\n<p>of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same</p>\n<p>with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and</p>",
        "<p>only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”</p>\n<p>“It certainly sounds feasible.”</p>\n<p>“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.</p>\n<p>Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but</p>\n<p>it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against</p>\n<p>him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life</p>\n<p>appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter</p>",
        "<p>stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what</p>\n<p>Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when</p>\n<p>there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his</p>\n<p>disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I</p>\n<p>cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first</p>\n<p>glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.”</p>\n<p>While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of</p>",
        "<p>events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town</p>\n<p>until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled</p>\n<p>along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,</p>\n<p>however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights</p>\n<p>still glimmered in the windows.</p>\n<p>“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched</p>\n<p>on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,</p>",
        "<p>passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light</p>\n<p>among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman</p>\n<p>whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink</p>\n<p>of our horse’s feet.”</p>\n<p>“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.</p>\n<p>Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest</p>",
        "<p>assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and</p>\n<p>colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her</p>\n<p>husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!”</p>\n<p>We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own</p>\n<p>grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing</p>\n<p>down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to</p>\n<p>the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde</p>",
        "<p>woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de</p>\n<p>soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She</p>\n<p>stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand</p>\n<p>upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly</p>\n<p>bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a</p>\n<p>standing question.</p>\n<p>“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of us,</p>",
        "<p>she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my</p>\n<p>companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.</p>\n<p>“No good news?”</p>\n<p>“None.”</p>\n<p>“No bad?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a</p>",
        "<p>long day.”</p>\n<p>“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in</p>\n<p>several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to</p>\n<p>bring him out and associate him with this investigation.”</p>\n<p>“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly. “You</p>\n<p>will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our</p>\n<p>arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly</p>",
        "<p>upon us.”</p>\n<p>“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I</p>\n<p>can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any</p>\n<p>assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed</p>\n<p>happy.”</p>\n<p>“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady as we entered a well-lit</p>\n<p>dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,</p>",
        "<p>“I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to</p>\n<p>which I beg that you will give a plain answer.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly, madam.”</p>\n<p>“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to</p>\n<p>fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”</p>\n<p>“Upon what point?”</p>\n<p>“In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?”</p>",
        "<p>Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly,</p>\n<p>now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at</p>\n<p>him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.</p>\n<p>“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”</p>\n<p>“You think that he is dead?”</p>\n<p>“I do.”</p>\n<p>“Murdered?”</p>",
        "<p>“I don’t say that. Perhaps.”</p>\n<p>“And on what day did he meet his death?”</p>\n<p>“On Monday.”</p>\n<p>“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is</p>\n<p>that I have received a letter from him to-day.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.</p>\n<p>“What!” he roared.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in</p>\n<p>the air.</p>\n<p>“May I see it?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly.”</p>\n<p>He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the</p>\n<p>table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my</p>\n<p>chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very</p>",
        "<p>coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the</p>\n<p>date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was</p>\n<p>considerably after midnight.</p>\n<p>“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s</p>\n<p>writing, madam.”</p>\n<p>“No, but the enclosure is.”</p>\n<p>“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and</p>",
        "<p>inquire as to the address.”</p>\n<p>“How can you tell that?”</p>\n<p>“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.</p>\n<p>The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has</p>\n<p>been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none</p>\n<p>would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and</p>\n<p>there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only</p>",
        "<p>mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but</p>\n<p>there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.</p>\n<p>Ha! there has been an enclosure here!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”</p>\n<p>“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”</p>\n<p>“One of his hands.”</p>\n<p>“One?”</p>",
        "<p>“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,</p>\n<p>and yet I know it well.”</p>\n<p>“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge</p>\n<p>error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in</p>\n<p>patience.—NEVILLE.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,</p>\n<p>octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man</p>\n<p>with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very</p>",
        "<p>much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have</p>\n<p>no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”</p>\n<p>“None. Neville wrote those words.”</p>\n<p>“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the</p>\n<p>clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is</p>\n<p>over.”</p>\n<p>“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”</p>",
        "<p>“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The</p>\n<p>ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”</p>\n<p>“No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!”</p>\n<p>“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only</p>\n<p>posted to-day.”</p>\n<p>“That is possible.”</p>\n<p>“If so, much may have happened between.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well</p>\n<p>with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if</p>\n<p>evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself</p>\n<p>in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly</p>\n<p>with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think</p>\n<p>that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his</p>\n<p>death?”</p>",
        "<p>“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be</p>\n<p>more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in</p>\n<p>this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to</p>\n<p>corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write</p>\n<p>letters, why should he remain away from you?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”</p>\n<p>“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”</p>",
        "<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”</p>\n<p>“Very much so.”</p>\n<p>“Was the window open?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Then he might have called to you?”</p>\n<p>“He might.”</p>",
        "<p>“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“A call for help, you thought?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. He waved his hands.”</p>\n<p>“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the</p>\n<p>unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”</p>\n<p>“It is possible.”</p>",
        "<p>“And you thought he was pulled back?”</p>\n<p>“He disappeared so suddenly.”</p>\n<p>“He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?”</p>\n<p>“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the</p>\n<p>Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary</p>\n<p>clothes on?”</p>",
        "<p>“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”</p>\n<p>“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”</p>\n<p>“Never.”</p>\n<p>“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”</p>\n<p>“Never.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which</p>\n<p>I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and</p>",
        "<p>then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our</p>\n<p>disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after</p>\n<p>my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he</p>\n<p>had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for</p>\n<p>a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking</p>\n<p>at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or</p>",
        "<p>convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident</p>\n<p>to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off</p>\n<p>his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then</p>\n<p>wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions</p>\n<p>from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of</p>\n<p>Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an</p>\n<p>ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In</p>",
        "<p>the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe</p>\n<p>between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the</p>\n<p>ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with</p>\n<p>the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I</p>\n<p>dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me</p>\n<p>to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The</p>\n<p>pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the</p>",
        "<p>room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap</p>\n<p>of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.</p>\n<p>“Awake, Watson?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Game for a morning drive?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly.”</p>\n<p>“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy</p>",
        "<p>sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as</p>\n<p>he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the</p>\n<p>sombre thinker of the previous night.</p>\n<p>As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was</p>\n<p>stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished</p>\n<p>when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the</p>\n<p>horse.</p>",
        "<p>“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his</p>\n<p>boots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of</p>\n<p>one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from</p>\n<p>here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”</p>\n<p>“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.</p>\n<p>“In the bathroom,” he answered. “Oh, yes, I am not joking,” he</p>\n<p>continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and</p>",
        "<p>I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,</p>\n<p>my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”</p>\n<p>We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the</p>\n<p>bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the</p>\n<p>half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away</p>\n<p>we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,</p>\n<p>bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on</p>",
        "<p>either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.</p>\n<p>“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the</p>\n<p>horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole,</p>\n<p>but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”</p>\n<p>In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from</p>\n<p>their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.</p>\n<p>Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and</p>",
        "<p>dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found</p>\n<p>ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force,</p>\n<p>and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the</p>\n<p>horse’s head while the other led us in.</p>\n<p>“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the</p>",
        "<p>stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to</p>\n<p>have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”</p>\n<p>It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,</p>\n<p>and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his</p>\n<p>desk.</p>\n<p>“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”</p>",
        "<p>“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with</p>\n<p>being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”</p>\n<p>“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”</p>\n<p>“So I heard. You have him here?”</p>\n<p>“In the cells.”</p>\n<p>“Is he quiet?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”</p>",
        "<p>“Dirty?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is</p>\n<p>as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he</p>\n<p>will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would</p>\n<p>agree with me that he needed it.”</p>\n<p>“I should like to see him very much.”</p>\n<p>“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your</p>",
        "<p>bag.”</p>\n<p>“No, I think that I’ll take it.”</p>\n<p>“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage,</p>\n<p>opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a</p>\n<p>whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.</p>\n<p>“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He</p>\n<p>quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced</p>",
        "<p>through.</p>\n<p>“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”</p>\n<p>We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face</p>\n<p>towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was</p>\n<p>a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a</p>\n<p>coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He</p>\n<p>was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which</p>",
        "<p>covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad</p>\n<p>wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its</p>\n<p>contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three</p>\n<p>teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red</p>\n<p>hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.</p>\n<p>“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.</p>\n<p>“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he</p>",
        "<p>might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened</p>\n<p>the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very</p>\n<p>large bath-sponge.</p>\n<p>“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.</p>\n<p>“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very</p>\n<p>quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look a</p>",
        "<p>credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the</p>\n<p>lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half</p>\n<p>turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes</p>\n<p>stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it</p>\n<p>twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.</p>\n<p>“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,</p>\n<p>in the county of Kent.”</p>",
        "<p>Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off</p>\n<p>under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown</p>\n<p>tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and</p>\n<p>the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A</p>\n<p>twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his</p>\n<p>bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and</p>\n<p>smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy</p>",
        "<p>bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a</p>\n<p>scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.</p>\n<p>“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man.</p>\n<p>I know him from the photograph.”</p>\n<p>The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself</p>\n<p>to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”</p>\n<p>“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged</p>",
        "<p>with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the</p>\n<p>inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the</p>\n<p>force, but this really takes the cake.”</p>\n<p>“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has</p>\n<p>been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”</p>\n<p>“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”</p>",
        "<p>“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God</p>\n<p>help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an</p>\n<p>exposure! What can I do?”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly</p>\n<p>on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he,</p>\n<p>“of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you</p>",
        "<p>convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against</p>\n<p>you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should</p>\n<p>find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,</p>\n<p>make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the</p>\n<p>proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”</p>\n<p>“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would have endured</p>\n<p>imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable</p>",
        "<p>secret as a family blot to my children.</p>\n<p>“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a</p>\n<p>schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.</p>\n<p>I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a</p>\n<p>reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to</p>\n<p>have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I</p>\n<p>volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my</p>",
        "<p>adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I</p>\n<p>could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I</p>\n<p>had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been</p>\n<p>famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my</p>\n<p>attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as</p>\n<p>possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by</p>\n<p>the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head</p>",
        "<p>of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business</p>\n<p>part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.</p>\n<p>For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the</p>\n<p>evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.</p>\n<p>4_d_.</p>\n<p>“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some</p>\n<p>time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me</p>",
        "<p>for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden</p>\n<p>idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked</p>\n<p>for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the</p>\n<p>City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the</p>\n<p>debt.</p>\n<p>“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work</p>\n<p>at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by</p>",
        "<p>smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and</p>\n<p>sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but</p>\n<p>the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day</p>\n<p>in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly</p>\n<p>face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.</p>\n<p>He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam</p>\n<p>Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the</p>",
        "<p>evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This</p>\n<p>fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew</p>\n<p>that my secret was safe in his possession.</p>\n<p>“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.</p>\n<p>I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700</p>\n<p>a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional</p>\n<p>advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of</p>",
        "<p>repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised</p>\n<p>character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,</p>\n<p>poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take</p>\n<p>£ 2.</p>\n<p>“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,</p>\n<p>and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real</p>\n<p>occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She</p>",
        "<p>little knew what.</p>\n<p>“Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room</p>\n<p>above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my</p>\n<p>horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with</p>\n<p>her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms</p>\n<p>to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated</p>\n<p>him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice</p>",
        "<p>downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off</p>\n<p>my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and</p>\n<p>wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But</p>\n<p>then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and</p>\n<p>that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by</p>\n<p>my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the</p>\n<p>bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the</p>",
        "<p>coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in</p>\n<p>which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it</p>\n<p>disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but</p>\n<p>at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few</p>\n<p>minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of</p>\n<p>being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his</p>\n<p>murderer.</p>",
        "<p>“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was</p>\n<p>determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my</p>\n<p>preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly</p>\n<p>anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a</p>\n<p>moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried</p>\n<p>scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”</p>\n<p>“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.</p>",
        "<p>“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”</p>\n<p>“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and</p>\n<p>I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter</p>\n<p>unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who</p>\n<p>forgot all about it for some days.”</p>\n<p>“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of</p>\n<p>it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”</p>",
        "<p>“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”</p>\n<p>“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to</p>\n<p>hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”</p>\n<p>“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”</p>\n<p>“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be</p>\n<p>taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,</p>\n<p>Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared</p>",
        "<p>the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”</p>\n<p>“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and</p>\n<p>consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker</p>\n<p>Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”</p>",
        "<h3>The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle</h3>\n<p>VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE</p>\n<p>I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning</p>\n<p>after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of</p>\n<p>the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a</p>\n<p>pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled</p>\n<p>morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch</p>",
        "<p>was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and</p>\n<p>disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in</p>\n<p>several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair</p>\n<p>suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the</p>\n<p>purpose of examination.</p>\n<p>“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”</p>\n<p>“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my</p>",
        "<p>results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one”—he jerked his thumb in</p>\n<p>the direction of the old hat—“but there are points in connection with</p>\n<p>it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”</p>\n<p>I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his</p>\n<p>crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were</p>\n<p>thick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as</p>\n<p>it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is</p>",
        "<p>the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the</p>\n<p>punishment of some crime.”</p>\n<p>“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of those</p>\n<p>whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million</p>\n<p>human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square</p>\n<p>miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity,</p>\n<p>every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and</p>",
        "<p>many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and</p>\n<p>bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of</p>\n<p>such.”</p>\n<p>“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have</p>\n<p>added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”</p>\n<p>“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,</p>\n<p>to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of</p>",
        "<p>the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small</p>\n<p>matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson,</p>\n<p>the commissionaire?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”</p>\n<p>“It is his hat.”</p>\n<p>“No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look</p>",
        "<p>upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.</p>\n<p>And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,</p>\n<p>in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting</p>\n<p>at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about</p>\n<p>four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a</p>\n<p>very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was</p>\n<p>making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he</p>",
        "<p>saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and</p>\n<p>carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the</p>\n<p>corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a</p>\n<p>little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on</p>\n<p>which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his</p>\n<p>head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward</p>\n<p>to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at</p>",
        "<p>having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in</p>\n<p>uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and</p>\n<p>vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of</p>\n<p>Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of</p>\n<p>Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and</p>\n<p>also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a</p>\n<p>most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”</p>",
        "<p>“Which surely he restored to their owner?”</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs.</p>\n<p>Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s</p>\n<p>left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible</p>\n<p>upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,</p>\n<p>and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy</p>\n<p>to restore lost property to any one of them.”</p>",
        "<p>“What, then, did Peterson do?”</p>\n<p>“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,</p>\n<p>knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The</p>\n<p>goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in</p>\n<p>spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten</p>\n<p>without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to</p>\n<p>fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the</p>",
        "<p>hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”</p>\n<p>“Did he not advertise?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”</p>\n<p>“Only as much as we can deduce.”</p>\n<p>“From his hat?”</p>\n<p>“Precisely.”</p>",
        "<p>“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”</p>\n<p>“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as</p>\n<p>to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”</p>\n<p>I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather</p>\n<p>ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,</p>\n<p>hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but</p>\n<p>was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes</p>",
        "<p>had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was</p>\n<p>pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For</p>\n<p>the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several</p>\n<p>places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the</p>\n<p>discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.</p>\n<p>“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.</p>\n<p>“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to</p>",
        "<p>reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your</p>\n<p>inferences.”</p>\n<p>“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”</p>\n<p>He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion</p>\n<p>which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it</p>\n<p>might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences</p>\n<p>which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a</p>",
        "<p>strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is</p>\n<p>of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly</p>\n<p>well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon</p>\n<p>evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing</p>\n<p>to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his</p>\n<p>fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at</p>\n<p>work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife</p>",
        "<p>has ceased to love him.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Holmes!”</p>\n<p>“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued,</p>\n<p>disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary life,</p>\n<p>goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has</p>\n<p>grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which</p>\n<p>he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are</p>",
        "<p>to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely</p>\n<p>improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”</p>\n<p>“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”</p>\n<p>“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these</p>\n<p>results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”</p>\n<p>“I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am</p>\n<p>unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was</p>",
        "<p>intellectual?”</p>\n<p>For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the</p>\n<p>forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of</p>\n<p>cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have</p>\n<p>something in it.”</p>\n<p>“The decline of his fortunes, then?”</p>\n<p>“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came</p>",
        "<p>in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of</p>\n<p>ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy</p>\n<p>so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he</p>\n<p>has assuredly gone down in the world.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and</p>\n<p>the moral retrogression?”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his</p>",
        "<p>finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are</p>\n<p>never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a</p>\n<p>certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this</p>\n<p>precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the</p>\n<p>elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has</p>\n<p>less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a</p>\n<p>weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some</p>",
        "<p>of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign</p>\n<p>that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”</p>\n<p>“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”</p>\n<p>“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,</p>\n<p>that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to</p>\n<p>be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.</p>\n<p>The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the</p>",
        "<p>scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a</p>\n<p>distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the</p>\n<p>gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,</p>\n<p>showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the</p>\n<p>marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer</p>\n<p>perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of</p>\n<p>training.”</p>",
        "<p>“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”</p>\n<p>“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear</p>\n<p>Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your</p>\n<p>wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also</p>\n<p>have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”</p>\n<p>“But he might be a bachelor.”</p>\n<p>“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.</p>",
        "<p>Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”</p>\n<p>“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that</p>\n<p>the gas is not laid on in his house?”</p>\n<p>“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no</p>\n<p>less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the</p>\n<p>individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning</p>\n<p>tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a</p>",
        "<p>guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from</p>\n<p>a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”</p>\n<p>“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said</p>\n<p>just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the</p>\n<p>loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,</p>\n<p>and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with</p>",
        "<p>flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.</p>\n<p>“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.</p>\n<p>“Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through</p>\n<p>the kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get</p>\n<p>a fairer view of the man’s excited face.</p>\n<p>“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his</p>\n<p>hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly</p>",
        "<p>scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of</p>\n<p>such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the</p>\n<p>dark hollow of his hand.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said he,</p>\n<p>“this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”</p>\n<p>“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were</p>\n<p>putty.”</p>",
        "<p>“It’s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.”</p>\n<p>“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated.</p>\n<p>“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have</p>\n<p>read the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It is</p>\n<p>absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the</p>\n<p>reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of</p>\n<p>the market price.”</p>",
        "<p>“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped</p>\n<p>down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.</p>\n<p>“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are</p>\n<p>sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the</p>\n<p>Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the</p>\n<p>gem.”</p>\n<p>“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,” I</p>",
        "<p>remarked.</p>\n<p>“Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a</p>\n<p>plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s</p>\n<p>jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has</p>\n<p>been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I</p>\n<p>believe.” He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,</p>\n<p>until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the</p>",
        "<p>following paragraph:</p>\n<p>“Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was</p>\n<p>brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted</p>\n<p>from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as</p>\n<p>the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his</p>\n<p>evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room</p>\n<p>of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he</p>",
        "<p>might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had</p>\n<p>remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called</p>\n<p>away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the</p>\n<p>bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in</p>\n<p>which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep</p>\n<p>her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly</p>\n<p>gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone</p>",
        "<p>could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine</p>\n<p>Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of</p>\n<p>dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,</p>\n<p>where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector</p>\n<p>Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who</p>\n<p>struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest</p>\n<p>terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given</p>",
        "<p>against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the</p>\n<p>offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of</p>\n<p>intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion</p>\n<p>and was carried out of court.”</p>\n<p>“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing</p>\n<p>aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence of</p>\n<p>events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a</p>",
        "<p>goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little</p>\n<p>deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less</p>\n<p>innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and</p>\n<p>the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and</p>\n<p>all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we</p>\n<p>must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and</p>\n<p>ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do</p>",
        "<p>this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly</p>\n<p>in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall</p>\n<p>have recourse to other methods.”</p>\n<p>“What will you say?”</p>\n<p>“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the</p>\n<p>corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker</p>\n<p>can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker</p>",
        "<p>Street.’ That is clear and concise.”</p>\n<p>“Very. But will he see it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,</p>\n<p>the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in</p>\n<p>breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of</p>\n<p>nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the</p>\n<p>impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the</p>",
        "<p>introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who</p>\n<p>knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run</p>\n<p>down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening</p>\n<p>papers.”</p>\n<p>“In which, sir?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. James’s Gazette_,</p>\n<p>_Evening News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.”</p>",
        "<p>“Very well, sir. And this stone?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just</p>\n<p>buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must</p>\n<p>have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your</p>\n<p>family is now devouring.”</p>\n<p>When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it</p>\n<p>against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it</p>",
        "<p>glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.</p>\n<p>Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and</p>\n<p>older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not</p>\n<p>yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in</p>\n<p>southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the</p>\n<p>carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite</p>\n<p>of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two</p>",
        "<p>murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought</p>\n<p>about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.</p>\n<p>Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows</p>\n<p>and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to</p>\n<p>the Countess to say that we have it.”</p>\n<p>“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot tell.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had</p>\n<p>anything to do with the matter?”</p>\n<p>“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely</p>\n<p>innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was</p>\n<p>of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,</p>\n<p>however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer</p>\n<p>to our advertisement.”</p>",
        "<p>“And you can do nothing until then?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing.”</p>\n<p>“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come</p>\n<p>back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like</p>\n<p>to see the solution of so tangled a business.”</p>\n<p>“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.</p>\n<p>By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Hudson to examine its crop.”</p>\n<p>I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six</p>\n<p>when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the</p>\n<p>house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was</p>\n<p>buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which</p>\n<p>was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened,</p>\n<p>and we were shown up together to Holmes’ room.</p>",
        "<p>“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and</p>\n<p>greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so</p>\n<p>readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a</p>\n<p>cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for</p>\n<p>summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right</p>\n<p>time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”</p>",
        "<p>He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,</p>\n<p>intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A</p>\n<p>touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended</p>\n<p>hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black</p>\n<p>frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,</p>\n<p>and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff</p>\n<p>or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with</p>",
        "<p>care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and</p>\n<p>letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.</p>\n<p>“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we</p>\n<p>expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at</p>\n<p>a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”</p>\n<p>Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so</p>\n<p>plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that</p>",
        "<p>the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the</p>\n<p>bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at</p>\n<p>recovering them.”</p>\n<p>“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.</p>\n<p>“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I</p>",
        "<p>presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the</p>\n<p>same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally</p>\n<p>well?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your</p>\n<p>own bird, so if you wish—”</p>\n<p>The man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as</p>",
        "<p>relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see</p>\n<p>what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be</p>\n<p>to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my</p>\n<p>attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his</p>\n<p>shoulders.</p>\n<p>“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way,</p>",
        "<p>would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am</p>\n<p>somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown</p>\n<p>goose.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained</p>\n<p>property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha</p>\n<p>Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the</p>\n<p>day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,</p>",
        "<p>instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence</p>\n<p>every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were</p>\n<p>duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,</p>\n<p>sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.”</p>\n<p>With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and</p>\n<p>strode off upon his way.</p>\n<p>“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door</p>",
        "<p>behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about</p>\n<p>the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”</p>\n<p>“Not particularly.”</p>\n<p>“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up</p>\n<p>this clue while it is still hot.”</p>\n<p>“By all means.”</p>\n<p>It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats</p>",
        "<p>about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a</p>\n<p>cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke</p>\n<p>like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as</p>\n<p>we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,</p>\n<p>and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an</p>\n<p>hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small</p>\n<p>public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into</p>",
        "<p>Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two</p>\n<p>glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.</p>\n<p>“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said</p>\n<p>he.</p>\n<p>“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.</p>\n<p>“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was</p>\n<p>a member of your goose club.”</p>",
        "<p>“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed! Whose, then?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”</p>\n<p>“Breckinridge is his name.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and</p>\n<p>prosperity to your house. Good-night.”</p>",
        "<p>“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we</p>\n<p>came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so</p>\n<p>homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the</p>\n<p>other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless</p>\n<p>we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but</p>\n<p>confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation</p>\n<p>which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has</p>",
        "<p>placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to</p>\n<p>the south, then, and quick march!”</p>\n<p>We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag</p>\n<p>of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the</p>\n<p>name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,</p>\n<p>with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up</p>\n<p>the shutters.</p>",
        "<p>“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.</p>\n<p>“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare</p>\n<p>slabs of marble.</p>\n<p>“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”</p>\n<p>“That’s no good.”</p>\n<p>“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”</p>",
        "<p>“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”</p>\n<p>“Who by?”</p>\n<p>“The landlord of the Alpha.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”</p>\n<p>“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”</p>\n<p>To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the</p>\n<p>salesman.</p>",
        "<p>“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,</p>\n<p>“what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”</p>\n<p>“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese</p>\n<p>which you supplied to the Alpha.”</p>\n<p>“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should</p>\n<p>be so warm over such a trifle.”</p>",
        "<p>“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I</p>\n<p>pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the</p>\n<p>business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the</p>\n<p>geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they</p>\n<p>were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making</p>",
        "<p>inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is</p>\n<p>off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter</p>\n<p>of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country</p>\n<p>bred.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the</p>\n<p>salesman.</p>\n<p>“It’s nothing of the kind.”</p>",
        "<p>“I say it is.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe it.”</p>\n<p>“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them</p>\n<p>ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the</p>\n<p>Alpha were town bred.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”</p>\n<p>“Will you bet, then?”</p>",
        "<p>“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll</p>\n<p>have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”</p>\n<p>The salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.</p>\n<p>The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great</p>\n<p>greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.</p>\n<p>“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out</p>\n<p>of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left</p>",
        "<p>in my shop. You see this little book?”</p>\n<p>“Well?”</p>\n<p>“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then,</p>\n<p>here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their</p>\n<p>names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You</p>\n<p>see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town</p>\n<p>suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”</p>",
        "<p>“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”</p>\n<p>Holmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott,</p>\n<p>117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”</p>\n<p>“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”</p>\n<p>“‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7_s_. 6_d_.’”</p>\n<p>“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”</p>",
        "<p>“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12_s_.’”</p>\n<p>“What have you to say now?”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his</p>\n<p>pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a</p>\n<p>man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped</p>\n<p>under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which</p>\n<p>was peculiar to him.</p>",
        "<p>“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’</p>\n<p>protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said</p>\n<p>he. “I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man</p>\n<p>would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him</p>\n<p>by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I</p>\n<p>fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains</p>\n<p>to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott</p>",
        "<p>to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear</p>\n<p>from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides</p>\n<p>ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”</p>\n<p>His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out</p>\n<p>from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little</p>\n<p>rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light</p>\n<p>which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the</p>",
        "<p>salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists</p>\n<p>fiercely at the cringing figure.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were</p>\n<p>all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your</p>\n<p>silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and</p>\n<p>I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese</p>\n<p>off you?”</p>",
        "<p>“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.</p>\n<p>“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”</p>\n<p>“She told me to ask you.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough</p>\n<p>of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer</p>\n<p>flitted away into the darkness.</p>\n<p>“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come</p>",
        "<p>with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding</p>\n<p>through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring</p>\n<p>stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him</p>\n<p>upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light</p>\n<p>that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.</p>\n<p>“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.</p>\n<p>“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help</p>",
        "<p>overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I</p>\n<p>think that I could be of assistance to you.”</p>\n<p>“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”</p>\n<p>“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other</p>\n<p>people don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“But you can know nothing of this?”</p>\n<p>“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some</p>",
        "<p>geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman</p>\n<p>named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and</p>\n<p>by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the</p>\n<p>little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can</p>\n<p>hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case</p>",
        "<p>we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept</p>\n<p>market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it</p>\n<p>is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”</p>\n<p>The man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he</p>\n<p>answered with a sidelong glance.</p>\n<p>“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes sweetly. “It is always awkward</p>\n<p>doing business with an alias.”</p>",
        "<p>A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well then,” said</p>\n<p>he, “my real name is James Ryder.”</p>\n<p>“Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into</p>\n<p>the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you</p>\n<p>would wish to know.”</p>\n<p>The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with</p>\n<p>half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he</p>",
        "<p>is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into</p>\n<p>the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker</p>\n<p>Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin</p>\n<p>breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of</p>\n<p>his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.</p>\n<p>“Here we are!” said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. “The</p>\n<p>fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.</p>",
        "<p>Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we</p>\n<p>settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what</p>\n<p>became of those geese?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which</p>\n<p>you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”</p>\n<p>Ryder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me</p>",
        "<p>where it went to?”</p>\n<p>“It came here.”</p>\n<p>“Here?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you</p>\n<p>should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the</p>\n<p>bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here</p>\n<p>in my museum.”</p>",
        "<p>Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his</p>\n<p>right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue</p>\n<p>carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,</p>\n<p>many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain</p>\n<p>whether to claim or to disown it.</p>\n<p>“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll</p>\n<p>be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not</p>",
        "<p>got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of</p>\n<p>brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to</p>\n<p>be sure!”</p>\n<p>For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought</p>\n<p>a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened</p>\n<p>eyes at his accuser.</p>\n<p>“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could</p>",
        "<p>possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that</p>\n<p>little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had</p>\n<p>heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”</p>\n<p>“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he in a crackling</p>\n<p>voice.</p>\n<p>“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden</p>\n<p>wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for</p>",
        "<p>better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means</p>\n<p>you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very</p>\n<p>pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had</p>\n<p>been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would</p>\n<p>rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some</p>\n<p>small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you</p>\n<p>managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you</p>",
        "<p>rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man</p>\n<p>arrested. You then—”</p>\n<p>Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my</p>\n<p>companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think of</p>\n<p>my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went</p>\n<p>wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible.</p>\n<p>Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”</p>",
        "<p>“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes sternly. “It is very well to</p>\n<p>cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner</p>\n<p>in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”</p>\n<p>“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge</p>\n<p>against him will break down.”</p>\n<p>“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of</p>\n<p>the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose</p>",
        "<p>into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope</p>\n<p>of safety.”</p>\n<p>Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it just</p>\n<p>as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it</p>\n<p>seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at</p>\n<p>once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it</p>\n<p>into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the</p>",
        "<p>hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and</p>\n<p>I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and</p>\n<p>lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the</p>\n<p>way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a</p>\n<p>detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring</p>\n<p>down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what</p>\n<p>was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been</p>",
        "<p>upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard</p>\n<p>and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.</p>\n<p>“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just</p>\n<p>been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell</p>\n<p>into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what</p>\n<p>they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two</p>\n<p>things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where</p>",
        "<p>he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn</p>\n<p>the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the</p>\n<p>agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any</p>\n<p>moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my</p>\n<p>waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and</p>\n<p>looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and</p>\n<p>suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the</p>",
        "<p>best detective that ever lived.</p>\n<p>“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of</p>\n<p>her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as</p>\n<p>good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my</p>\n<p>stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this</p>\n<p>I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I</p>\n<p>caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat</p>",
        "<p>as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the</p>\n<p>stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature</p>\n<p>flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the</p>\n<p>matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered</p>\n<p>off among the others.</p>\n<p>“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.</p>\n<p>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was</p>",
        "<p>feeling which was the fattest.’</p>\n<p>“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it.</p>\n<p>It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which</p>\n<p>makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’</p>\n<p>“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d</p>\n<p>rather have that one I was handling just now.’</p>\n<p>“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened</p>",
        "<p>it expressly for you.’</p>\n<p>“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you</p>\n<p>want, then?’</p>\n<p>“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the</p>\n<p>flock.’</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’</p>",
        "<p>“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the</p>\n<p>way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it</p>\n<p>was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and</p>\n<p>we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for</p>\n<p>there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake</p>\n<p>had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried</p>\n<p>into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.</p>\n<p>“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’</p>\n<p>“‘Which dealer’s?’</p>\n<p>“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’</p>\n<p>“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the</p>\n<p>one I chose?’</p>\n<p>“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell</p>",
        "<p>them apart.’</p>\n<p>“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet</p>\n<p>would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at</p>\n<p>once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You</p>\n<p>heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like</p>\n<p>that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am</p>\n<p>myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever</p>",
        "<p>having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!</p>\n<p>God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in</p>\n<p>his hands.</p>\n<p>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the</p>\n<p>measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’ finger-tips upon the edge of the</p>\n<p>table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.</p>\n<p>“Get out!” said he.</p>",
        "<p>“What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!”</p>\n<p>“No more words. Get out!”</p>\n<p>And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the</p>\n<p>stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls</p>\n<p>from the street.</p>\n<p>“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay</p>\n<p>pipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If</p>",
        "<p>Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will</p>\n<p>not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am</p>\n<p>commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.</p>\n<p>This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.</p>\n<p>Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides,</p>\n<p>it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most</p>\n<p>singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If</p>",
        "<p>you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin</p>\n<p>another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief</p>\n<p>feature.”</p>",
        "<h3>The Adventure of the Speckled Band</h3>\n<p>VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND</p>\n<p>On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have</p>\n<p>during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock</p>\n<p>Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,</p>\n<p>but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his</p>\n<p>art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself</p>",
        "<p>with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even</p>\n<p>the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any</p>\n<p>which presented more singular features than that which was associated</p>\n<p>with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The</p>\n<p>events in question occurred in the early days of my association with</p>\n<p>Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is</p>\n<p>possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a</p>",
        "<p>promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been</p>\n<p>freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom</p>\n<p>the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now</p>\n<p>come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread</p>\n<p>rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the</p>\n<p>matter even more terrible than the truth.</p>\n<p>It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find</p>",
        "<p>Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was</p>\n<p>a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me</p>\n<p>that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some</p>\n<p>surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself</p>\n<p>regular in my habits.</p>\n<p>“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot</p>\n<p>this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,</p>",
        "<p>and I on you.”</p>\n<p>“What is it, then—a fire?”</p>\n<p>“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable</p>\n<p>state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in</p>\n<p>the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at</p>\n<p>this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,</p>\n<p>I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to</p>",
        "<p>communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am</p>\n<p>sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I</p>\n<p>should call you and give you the chance.”</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”</p>\n<p>I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional</p>\n<p>investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as</p>\n<p>intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he</p>",
        "<p>unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on</p>\n<p>my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down</p>\n<p>to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who</p>\n<p>had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.</p>\n<p>“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes cheerily. “My name is Sherlock</p>\n<p>Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before</p>\n<p>whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see</p>",
        "<p>that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up</p>\n<p>to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that</p>\n<p>you are shivering.”</p>\n<p>“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman in a low voice,</p>\n<p>changing her seat as requested.</p>\n<p>“What, then?”</p>\n<p>“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she</p>",
        "<p>spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of</p>\n<p>agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,</p>\n<p>like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of</p>\n<p>a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her</p>\n<p>expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one</p>\n<p>of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.</p>\n<p>“You must not fear,” said he soothingly, bending forward and patting</p>",
        "<p>her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You</p>\n<p>have come in by train this morning, I see.”</p>\n<p>“You know me, then?”</p>\n<p>“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of</p>\n<p>your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good</p>\n<p>drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the</p>\n<p>station.”</p>",
        "<p>The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my</p>\n<p>companion.</p>\n<p>“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm</p>\n<p>of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The</p>\n<p>marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which</p>\n<p>throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand</p>\n<p>side of the driver.”</p>",
        "<p>“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I</p>\n<p>started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and</p>\n<p>came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no</p>\n<p>longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,</p>\n<p>save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little</p>\n<p>aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.</p>\n<p>Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from</p>",
        "<p>her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could</p>\n<p>help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense</p>\n<p>darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward</p>\n<p>you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,</p>\n<p>with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find</p>\n<p>me ungrateful.”</p>\n<p>Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small</p>",
        "<p>case-book, which he consulted.</p>\n<p>“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with</p>\n<p>an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,</p>\n<p>madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I</p>\n<p>did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own</p>\n<p>reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put</p>\n<p>to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay</p>",
        "<p>before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the</p>\n<p>matter.”</p>\n<p>“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies in</p>\n<p>the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so</p>\n<p>entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that</p>\n<p>even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and</p>\n<p>advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a</p>",
        "<p>nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing</p>\n<p>answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can</p>\n<p>see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may</p>\n<p>advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”</p>\n<p>“I am all attention, madam.”</p>\n<p>“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is</p>\n<p>the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the</p>",
        "<p>Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”</p>\n<p>Holmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.</p>\n<p>“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the</p>\n<p>estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and</p>\n<p>Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive</p>\n<p>heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin</p>\n<p>was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.</p>",
        "<p>Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the</p>\n<p>two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy</p>\n<p>mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the</p>\n<p>horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my</p>\n<p>stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,</p>\n<p>obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a</p>\n<p>medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional</p>",
        "<p>skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a</p>\n<p>fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been</p>\n<p>perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and</p>\n<p>narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term</p>\n<p>of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and</p>\n<p>disappointed man.</p>\n<p>“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the</p>",
        "<p>young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister</p>\n<p>Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of</p>\n<p>my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less</p>\n<p>than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely</p>\n<p>while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum</p>\n<p>should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly</p>\n<p>after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years</p>",
        "<p>ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his</p>\n<p>attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live</p>\n<p>with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my</p>\n<p>mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no</p>\n<p>obstacle to our happiness.</p>\n<p>“But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.</p>\n<p>Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,</p>",
        "<p>who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in</p>\n<p>the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came</p>\n<p>out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his</p>\n<p>path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in</p>\n<p>the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe,</p>\n<p>been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of</p>\n<p>disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,</p>",
        "<p>until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would</p>\n<p>fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and</p>\n<p>absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.</p>\n<p>“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,</p>\n<p>and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather</p>\n<p>together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no</p>\n<p>friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these</p>",
        "<p>vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land</p>\n<p>which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the</p>\n<p>hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for</p>\n<p>weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent</p>\n<p>over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and</p>\n<p>a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the</p>\n<p>villagers almost as much as their master.</p>",
        "<p>“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no</p>\n<p>great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a</p>\n<p>long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the</p>\n<p>time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even</p>\n<p>as mine has.”</p>\n<p>“Your sister is dead, then?”</p>\n<p>“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to</p>",
        "<p>speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have</p>\n<p>described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and</p>\n<p>position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss</p>\n<p>Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally</p>\n<p>allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at</p>\n<p>Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to</p>\n<p>whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when</p>",
        "<p>my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within</p>\n<p>a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the</p>\n<p>terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed</p>\n<p>and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and</p>\n<p>glanced across at his visitor.</p>\n<p>“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.</p>",
        "<p>“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is</p>\n<p>seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very</p>\n<p>old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are</p>\n<p>on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of</p>\n<p>the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second</p>\n<p>my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between</p>\n<p>them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself</p>",
        "<p>plain?”</p>\n<p>“Perfectly so.”</p>\n<p>“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal</p>\n<p>night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he</p>\n<p>had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the</p>\n<p>strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her</p>\n<p>room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,</p>",
        "<p>chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to</p>\n<p>leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.</p>\n<p>“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the</p>\n<p>dead of the night?’</p>\n<p>“‘Never,’ said I.</p>\n<p>“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your</p>\n<p>sleep?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Certainly not. But why?’</p>\n<p>“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the</p>\n<p>morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has</p>\n<p>awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next</p>\n<p>room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you</p>\n<p>whether you had heard it.’</p>\n<p>“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did</p>\n<p>not hear it also.’</p>\n<p>“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’</p>\n<p>“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at</p>\n<p>me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the</p>\n<p>lock.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in</p>",
        "<p>at night?”</p>\n<p>“Always.”</p>\n<p>“And why?”</p>\n<p>“I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a</p>\n<p>baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”</p>\n<p>“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune</p>",
        "<p>impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you</p>\n<p>know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely</p>\n<p>allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain</p>\n<p>was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the</p>\n<p>hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified</p>\n<p>woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,</p>\n<p>wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my</p>",
        "<p>door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a</p>\n<p>few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.</p>\n<p>As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved</p>\n<p>slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing</p>\n<p>what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I</p>\n<p>saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her</p>\n<p>hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that</p>",
        "<p>of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that</p>\n<p>moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She</p>\n<p>writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully</p>\n<p>convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I</p>\n<p>bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never</p>\n<p>forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There</p>\n<p>was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with</p>",
        "<p>her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a</p>\n<p>fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling</p>\n<p>loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his</p>\n<p>dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,</p>\n<p>and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid</p>\n<p>from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and</p>\n<p>died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful</p>",
        "<p>end of my beloved sister.”</p>\n<p>“One moment,” said Holmes, “are you sure about this whistle and</p>\n<p>metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”</p>\n<p>“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my</p>\n<p>strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale</p>\n<p>and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”</p>\n<p>“Was your sister dressed?”</p>",
        "<p>“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the</p>\n<p>charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.”</p>\n<p>“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the</p>\n<p>alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the</p>\n<p>coroner come to?”</p>\n<p>“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct</p>\n<p>had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any</p>",
        "<p>satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been</p>\n<p>fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by</p>\n<p>old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every</p>\n<p>night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite</p>\n<p>solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with</p>\n<p>the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large</p>\n<p>staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when</p>",
        "<p>she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon</p>\n<p>her.”</p>\n<p>“How about poison?”</p>\n<p>“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”</p>\n<p>“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”</p>\n<p>“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though</p>\n<p>what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”</p>",
        "<p>“Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled</p>\n<p>band?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,</p>\n<p>sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to</p>\n<p>these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted</p>",
        "<p>handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have</p>\n<p>suggested the strange adjective which she used.”</p>\n<p>Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.</p>\n<p>“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your</p>\n<p>narrative.”</p>\n<p>“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately</p>\n<p>lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have</p>",
        "<p>known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in</p>\n<p>marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr.</p>\n<p>Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no</p>\n<p>opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the</p>\n<p>spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the</p>\n<p>building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to</p>\n<p>move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very</p>",
        "<p>bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last</p>\n<p>night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly</p>\n<p>heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the</p>\n<p>herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was</p>\n<p>to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,</p>\n<p>so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a</p>\n<p>dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,</p>",
        "<p>from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing</p>\n<p>you and asking your advice.”</p>\n<p>“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, all.”</p>\n<p>“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.”</p>\n<p>“Why, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the</p>",
        "<p>hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the</p>\n<p>marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.</p>\n<p>“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a</p>\n<p>hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”</p>\n<p>There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his</p>\n<p>hands and stared into the crackling fire.</p>",
        "<p>“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand</p>\n<p>details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course</p>\n<p>of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to</p>\n<p>Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms</p>\n<p>without the knowledge of your stepfather?”</p>\n<p>“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most</p>\n<p>important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and</p>",
        "<p>that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,</p>\n<p>but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”</p>\n<p>“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”</p>\n<p>“By no means.”</p>\n<p>“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”</p>\n<p>“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in</p>\n<p>town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there</p>",
        "<p>in time for your coming.”</p>\n<p>“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small</p>\n<p>business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”</p>\n<p>“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my</p>\n<p>trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this</p>\n<p>afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided</p>\n<p>from the room.</p>",
        "<p>“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,</p>\n<p>leaning back in his chair.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”</p>\n<p>“Dark enough and sinister enough.”</p>\n<p>“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are</p>\n<p>sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her</p>\n<p>sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious</p>",
        "<p>end.”</p>\n<p>“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very</p>\n<p>peculiar words of the dying woman?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot think.”</p>\n<p>“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a</p>\n<p>band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the</p>\n<p>fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an</p>",
        "<p>interest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion</p>\n<p>to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a</p>\n<p>metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars</p>\n<p>that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that</p>\n<p>there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along</p>\n<p>those lines.”</p>\n<p>“But what, then, did the gipsies do?”</p>",
        "<p>“I cannot imagine.”</p>\n<p>“I see many objections to any such theory.”</p>\n<p>“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to</p>\n<p>Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,</p>\n<p>or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”</p>\n<p>The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our</p>\n<p>door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed</p>",
        "<p>himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the</p>\n<p>professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long</p>\n<p>frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in</p>\n<p>his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of</p>\n<p>the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to</p>\n<p>side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with</p>\n<p>the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the</p>",
        "<p>other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,</p>\n<p>fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird</p>\n<p>of prey.</p>\n<p>“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.</p>\n<p>“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion</p>\n<p>quietly.</p>\n<p>“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”</p>",
        "<p>“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”</p>\n<p>“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have</p>\n<p>traced her. What has she been saying to you?”</p>\n<p>“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.</p>\n<p>“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.</p>\n<p>“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my</p>\n<p>companion imperturbably.</p>",
        "<p>“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step</p>\n<p>forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I</p>\n<p>have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”</p>\n<p>My friend smiled.</p>\n<p>“Holmes, the busybody!”</p>\n<p>His smile broadened.</p>\n<p>“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”</p>",
        "<p>Holmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”</p>\n<p>said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided</p>\n<p>draught.”</p>\n<p>“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my</p>\n<p>affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a</p>\n<p>dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,</p>\n<p>seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.</p>",
        "<p>“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling</p>\n<p>the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.</p>\n<p>“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not</p>\n<p>quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my</p>\n<p>grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up</p>\n<p>the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.</p>\n<p>“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official</p>",
        "<p>detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,</p>\n<p>however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from</p>\n<p>her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we</p>\n<p>shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’</p>\n<p>Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this</p>\n<p>matter.”</p>\n<p>It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his</p>",
        "<p>excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over</p>\n<p>with notes and figures.</p>\n<p>“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its</p>\n<p>exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the</p>\n<p>investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the</p>\n<p>time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through</p>\n<p>the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can</p>",
        "<p>claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,</p>\n<p>therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a</p>\n<p>mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very</p>\n<p>serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has</p>\n<p>proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way</p>\n<p>of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for</p>\n<p>dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting</p>",
        "<p>ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and</p>\n<p>drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your</p>\n<p>revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument</p>\n<p>with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a</p>\n<p>tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”</p>\n<p>At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,</p>\n<p>where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five</p>",
        "<p>miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a</p>\n<p>bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and</p>\n<p>wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the</p>\n<p>air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least</p>\n<p>there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring</p>\n<p>and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in</p>\n<p>the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his</p>",
        "<p>eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed</p>\n<p>over the meadows.</p>\n<p>“Look there!” said he.</p>\n<p>A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into</p>\n<p>a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out</p>\n<p>the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.</p>",
        "<p>“Stoke Moran?” said he.</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the</p>\n<p>driver.</p>\n<p>“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we</p>\n<p>are going.”</p>\n<p>“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs</p>\n<p>some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll</p>",
        "<p>find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the</p>\n<p>fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”</p>\n<p>“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his</p>\n<p>eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”</p>\n<p>We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to</p>\n<p>Leatherhead.</p>\n<p>“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this</p>",
        "<p>fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite</p>\n<p>business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see</p>\n<p>that we have been as good as our word.”</p>\n<p>Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face</p>\n<p>which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she</p>\n<p>cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly.</p>\n<p>Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back</p>",
        "<p>before evening.”</p>\n<p>“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said</p>\n<p>Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss</p>\n<p>Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.</p>\n<p>“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”</p>\n<p>“So it appears.”</p>\n<p>“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will</p>",
        "<p>he say when he returns?”</p>\n<p>“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more</p>\n<p>cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him</p>\n<p>to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at</p>\n<p>Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us</p>\n<p>at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”</p>\n<p>The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central</p>",
        "<p>portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on</p>\n<p>each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked</p>\n<p>with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of</p>\n<p>ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the</p>\n<p>right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the</p>\n<p>windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that</p>\n<p>this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected</p>",
        "<p>against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but</p>\n<p>there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes</p>\n<p>walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep</p>\n<p>attention the outsides of the windows.</p>\n<p>“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the</p>\n<p>centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to</p>\n<p>Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”</p>",
        "<p>“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”</p>\n<p>“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not</p>\n<p>seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”</p>\n<p>“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my</p>\n<p>room.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing</p>\n<p>runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows</p>",
        "<p>in it, of course?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”</p>\n<p>“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable</p>\n<p>from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room</p>\n<p>and bar your shutters?”</p>\n<p>Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the</p>\n<p>open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but</p>",
        "<p>without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be</p>\n<p>passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but</p>\n<p>they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”</p>\n<p>said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly</p>\n<p>presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they</p>\n<p>were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the</p>\n<p>matter.”</p>",
        "<p>A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the</p>\n<p>three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so</p>\n<p>we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now</p>\n<p>sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a</p>\n<p>homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after</p>\n<p>the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in</p>\n<p>one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a</p>",
        "<p>dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,</p>\n<p>with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the</p>\n<p>room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round</p>\n<p>and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old</p>\n<p>and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of</p>\n<p>the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,</p>\n<p>while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in</p>",
        "<p>every detail of the apartment.</p>\n<p>“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a</p>\n<p>thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually</p>\n<p>lying upon the pillow.</p>\n<p>“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”</p>\n<p>“It looks newer than the other things?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”</p>",
        "<p>“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”</p>\n<p>“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we</p>\n<p>wanted for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You</p>\n<p>will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this</p>\n<p>floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand</p>\n<p>and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks</p>",
        "<p>between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which</p>\n<p>the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent</p>\n<p>some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.</p>\n<p>Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.</p>\n<p>“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.</p>\n<p>“Won’t it ring?”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You</p>",
        "<p>can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little</p>\n<p>opening for the ventilator is.”</p>\n<p>“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”</p>\n<p>“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or</p>\n<p>two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a</p>\n<p>builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the</p>\n<p>same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”</p>",
        "<p>“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.</p>\n<p>“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”</p>\n<p>“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy</p>\n<p>bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your</p>\n<p>permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the</p>\n<p>inner apartment.”</p>",
        "<p>Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his</p>\n<p>step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden</p>\n<p>shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair</p>\n<p>beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,</p>\n<p>and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.</p>\n<p>Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the</p>\n<p>keenest interest.</p>",
        "<p>“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.</p>\n<p>“My stepfather’s business papers.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”</p>\n<p>“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”</p>\n<p>“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”</p>\n<p>“No. What a strange idea!”</p>\n<p>“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on</p>",
        "<p>the top of it.</p>\n<p>“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a</p>\n<p>saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.</p>\n<p>There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down</p>\n<p>in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the</p>\n<p>greatest attention.</p>",
        "<p>“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his</p>\n<p>lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”</p>\n<p>The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one</p>\n<p>corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied</p>\n<p>so as to make a loop of whipcord.</p>\n<p>“What do you make of that, Watson?”</p>\n<p>“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”</p>",
        "<p>“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and</p>\n<p>when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I</p>\n<p>think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your</p>\n<p>permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”</p>\n<p>I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was</p>\n<p>when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked</p>\n<p>several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself</p>",
        "<p>liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his</p>\n<p>reverie.</p>\n<p>“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should</p>\n<p>absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”</p>\n<p>“I shall most certainly do so.”</p>\n<p>“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend</p>\n<p>upon your compliance.”</p>",
        "<p>“I assure you that I am in your hands.”</p>\n<p>“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your</p>\n<p>room.”</p>\n<p>Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.</p>\n<p>“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village</p>\n<p>inn over there?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that is the Crown.”</p>",
        "<p>“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly.”</p>\n<p>“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,</p>\n<p>when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the</p>\n<p>night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put</p>\n<p>your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with</p>\n<p>everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to</p>",
        "<p>occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage</p>\n<p>there for one night.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, easily.”</p>\n<p>“The rest you will leave in our hands.”</p>\n<p>“But what will you do?”</p>\n<p>“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the</p>\n<p>cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”</p>",
        "<p>“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said</p>\n<p>Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps I have.”</p>\n<p>“Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s</p>\n<p>death.”</p>\n<p>“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”</p>\n<p>“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she</p>",
        "<p>died from some sudden fright.”</p>\n<p>“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more</p>\n<p>tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.</p>\n<p>Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and</p>\n<p>be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured</p>\n<p>that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and</p>",
        "<p>sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from</p>\n<p>our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the</p>\n<p>inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby</p>\n<p>Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure</p>\n<p>of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing</p>\n<p>the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s</p>\n<p>voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.</p>",
        "<p>The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring</p>\n<p>up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.</p>\n<p>“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering</p>\n<p>darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There</p>\n<p>is a distinct element of danger.”</p>\n<p>“Can I be of assistance?”</p>\n<p>“Your presence might be invaluable.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then I shall certainly come.”</p>\n<p>“It is very kind of you.”</p>\n<p>“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than</p>\n<p>was visible to me.”</p>\n<p>“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that</p>\n<p>you saw all that I did.”</p>\n<p>“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that</p>",
        "<p>could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”</p>\n<p>“You saw the ventilator, too?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a</p>\n<p>small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could</p>\n<p>hardly pass through.”</p>\n<p>“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke</p>\n<p>Moran.”</p>",
        "<p>“My dear Holmes!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister</p>\n<p>could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once</p>\n<p>that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only</p>\n<p>be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s</p>\n<p>inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”</p>\n<p>“But what harm can there be in that?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator</p>\n<p>is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does</p>\n<p>not that strike you?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot as yet see any connection.”</p>\n<p>“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that</p>",
        "<p>before?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot say that I have.”</p>\n<p>“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same</p>\n<p>relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call</p>\n<p>it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”</p>\n<p>“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are</p>\n<p>only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”</p>",
        "<p>“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is</p>\n<p>the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and</p>\n<p>Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes</p>\n<p>even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike</p>\n<p>deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is</p>\n<p>over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds</p>\n<p>for a few hours to something more cheerful.”</p>",
        "<p>About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all</p>\n<p>was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly</p>\n<p>away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright</p>\n<p>light shone out right in front of us.</p>\n<p>“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes</p>\n<p>from the middle window.”</p>\n<p>As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining</p>",
        "<p>that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was</p>\n<p>possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were</p>\n<p>out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow</p>\n<p>light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our</p>\n<p>sombre errand.</p>\n<p>There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired</p>\n<p>breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we</p>",
        "<p>reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the</p>\n<p>window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed</p>\n<p>to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass</p>\n<p>with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the</p>\n<p>darkness.</p>\n<p>“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”</p>\n<p>Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice</p>",
        "<p>upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put</p>\n<p>his lips to my ear.</p>\n<p>“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”</p>\n<p>I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a</p>\n<p>cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any</p>\n<p>moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following</p>\n<p>Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the</p>",
        "<p>bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp</p>\n<p>onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had</p>\n<p>seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of</p>\n<p>his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that</p>\n<p>I could do to distinguish the words:</p>\n<p>“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”</p>\n<p>I nodded to show that I had heard.</p>",
        "<p>“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”</p>\n<p>I nodded again.</p>\n<p>“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol</p>\n<p>ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and</p>\n<p>you in that chair.”</p>\n<p>I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.</p>\n<p>Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed</p>",
        "<p>beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.</p>\n<p>Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.</p>\n<p>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,</p>\n<p>not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat</p>\n<p>open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous</p>\n<p>tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of</p>\n<p>light, and we waited in absolute darkness.</p>",
        "<p>From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our</p>\n<p>very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah</p>\n<p>was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the</p>\n<p>parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they</p>\n<p>seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and</p>\n<p>still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.</p>\n<p>Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction</p>",
        "<p>of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a</p>\n<p>strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room</p>\n<p>had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then</p>\n<p>all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an</p>\n<p>hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became</p>\n<p>audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of</p>\n<p>steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,</p>",
        "<p>Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with</p>\n<p>his cane at the bell-pull.</p>\n<p>“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”</p>\n<p>But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a</p>\n<p>low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes</p>\n<p>made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed</p>\n<p>so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and</p>",
        "<p>filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing</p>\n<p>up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the</p>\n<p>night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled</p>\n<p>up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all</p>\n<p>mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the</p>\n<p>village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the</p>\n<p>sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood</p>",
        "<p>gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died</p>\n<p>away into the silence from which it rose.</p>\n<p>“What can it mean?” I gasped.</p>\n<p>“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after</p>\n<p>all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.</p>\n<p>Roylott’s room.”</p>\n<p>With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.</p>",
        "<p>Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then</p>\n<p>he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked</p>\n<p>pistol in my hand.</p>\n<p>It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a</p>\n<p>dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of</p>\n<p>light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this</p>\n<p>table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long</p>",
        "<p>grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet</p>\n<p>thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short</p>\n<p>stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin</p>\n<p>was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at</p>\n<p>the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow</p>\n<p>band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round</p>\n<p>his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.</p>",
        "<p>“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.</p>\n<p>I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to</p>\n<p>move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat</p>\n<p>diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.</p>\n<p>“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He</p>\n<p>has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,</p>\n<p>recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he</p>",
        "<p>digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we</p>\n<p>can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county</p>\n<p>police know what has happened.”</p>\n<p>As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and</p>\n<p>throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid</p>\n<p>perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,</p>\n<p>which he closed upon it.</p>",
        "<p>Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke</p>\n<p>Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has</p>\n<p>already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news</p>\n<p>to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the</p>\n<p>care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official</p>\n<p>inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while</p>\n<p>indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet</p>",
        "<p>to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled</p>\n<p>back next day.</p>\n<p>“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which</p>\n<p>shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from</p>\n<p>insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word</p>\n<p>‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the</p>\n<p>appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of</p>",
        "<p>her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I</p>\n<p>can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position</p>\n<p>when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an</p>\n<p>occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.</p>\n<p>My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to</p>\n<p>this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The</p>\n<p>discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the</p>",
        "<p>floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as</p>\n<p>a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.</p>\n<p>The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it</p>\n<p>with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of</p>\n<p>creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.</p>\n<p>The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be</p>\n<p>discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a</p>",
        "<p>clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity</p>\n<p>with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point</p>\n<p>of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who</p>\n<p>could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where</p>\n<p>the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of</p>\n<p>course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to</p>\n<p>the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we</p>",
        "<p>saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this</p>\n<p>ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it</p>\n<p>would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not</p>\n<p>bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but</p>\n<p>sooner or later she must fall a victim.</p>\n<p>“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An</p>\n<p>inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of</p>",
        "<p>standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he</p>\n<p>should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,</p>\n<p>and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which</p>\n<p>may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was</p>\n<p>obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe</p>\n<p>upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the</p>\n<p>steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the</p>",
        "<p>creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit</p>\n<p>the light and attacked it.”</p>\n<p>“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”</p>\n<p>“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the</p>\n<p>other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its</p>\n<p>snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this</p>\n<p>way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s</p>",
        "<p>death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my</p>\n<p>conscience.”</p>"

        "<h3>The Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb</h3>\n<p>IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER’S THUMB</p>\n<p>Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there</p>\n<p>were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that</p>\n<p>of Mr. Hatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of</p>\n<p>these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and</p>",
        "<p>original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so</p>\n<p>dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed</p>\n<p>upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those</p>\n<p>deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable</p>\n<p>results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the</p>\n<p>newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less</p>\n<p>striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than</p>",
        "<p>when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery</p>\n<p>clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which</p>\n<p>leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a</p>\n<p>deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served</p>\n<p>to weaken the effect.</p>\n<p>It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the</p>\n<p>events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to</p>",
        "<p>civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street</p>\n<p>rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even</p>\n<p>persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit</p>\n<p>us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no</p>\n<p>very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from</p>\n<p>among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and</p>\n<p>lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of</p>",
        "<p>endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any</p>\n<p>influence.</p>\n<p>One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the</p>\n<p>maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from</p>\n<p>Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed</p>\n<p>hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom</p>\n<p>trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the</p>",
        "<p>guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;</p>\n<p>“he’s all right.”</p>\n<p>“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some</p>\n<p>strange creature which he had caged up in my room.</p>\n<p>“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round</p>\n<p>myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I</p>",
        "<p>must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off</p>\n<p>he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.</p>\n<p>I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.</p>\n<p>He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap</p>\n<p>which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a</p>\n<p>handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He</p>\n<p>was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,</p>",
        "<p>masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression</p>\n<p>of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took</p>\n<p>all his strength of mind to control.</p>\n<p>“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he, “but I have had</p>\n<p>a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this</p>\n<p>morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a</p>\n<p>doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a</p>",
        "<p>card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”</p>\n<p>I took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic</p>\n<p>engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).” That was the name, style,</p>\n<p>and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you</p>\n<p>waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh from</p>\n<p>a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous</p>\n<p>occupation.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He</p>\n<p>laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his</p>\n<p>chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against</p>\n<p>that laugh.</p>\n<p>“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I poured out some</p>\n<p>water from a caraffe.</p>\n<p>It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical</p>",
        "<p>outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is</p>\n<p>over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and</p>\n<p>pale-looking.</p>\n<p>“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.</p>\n<p>“Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, and the</p>\n<p>colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.</p>\n<p>“That’s better!” said he. “And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly</p>",
        "<p>attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.”</p>\n<p>He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my</p>\n<p>hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding</p>\n<p>fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have</p>\n<p>been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.</p>\n<p>“Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It must have bled</p>\n<p>considerably.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have</p>\n<p>been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was</p>\n<p>still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round</p>\n<p>the wrist and braced it up with a twig.”</p>\n<p>“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”</p>\n<p>“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own</p>\n<p>province.”</p>",
        "<p>“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and</p>\n<p>sharp instrument.”</p>\n<p>“A thing like a cleaver,” said he.</p>\n<p>“An accident, I presume?”</p>\n<p>“By no means.”</p>\n<p>“What! a murderous attack?”</p>\n<p>“Very murderous indeed.”</p>",
        "<p>“You horrify me.”</p>\n<p>I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it</p>\n<p>over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without</p>\n<p>wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.</p>\n<p>“How is that?” I asked when I had finished.</p>\n<p>“Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was</p>\n<p>very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”</p>",
        "<p>“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying</p>\n<p>to your nerves.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,</p>\n<p>between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this</p>\n<p>wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for</p>\n<p>it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof</p>\n<p>with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which</p>",
        "<p>I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will</p>\n<p>be done.”</p>\n<p>“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you</p>\n<p>desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my</p>\n<p>friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and I should</p>\n<p>be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must</p>",
        "<p>use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to</p>\n<p>him?”</p>\n<p>“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”</p>\n<p>“I should be immensely obliged to you.”</p>\n<p>“We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a</p>\n<p>little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an</p>\n<p>instant.” I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,</p>\n<p>and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new</p>\n<p>acquaintance to Baker Street.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in</p>\n<p>his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking</p>\n<p>his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and</p>",
        "<p>dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and</p>\n<p>collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his</p>\n<p>quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us</p>\n<p>in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance</p>\n<p>upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of</p>\n<p>brandy and water within his reach.</p>\n<p>“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Hatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely</p>\n<p>at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up</p>\n<p>your strength with a little stimulant.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another man since the</p>\n<p>doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the</p>\n<p>cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I</p>\n<p>shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.”</p>",
        "<p>Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression</p>\n<p>which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,</p>\n<p>and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor</p>\n<p>detailed to us.</p>\n<p>“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing</p>\n<p>alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer,</p>\n<p>and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven</p>",
        "<p>years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm,</p>\n<p>of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also</p>\n<p>come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I</p>\n<p>determined to start in business for myself and took professional</p>\n<p>chambers in Victoria Street.</p>\n<p>“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business</p>\n<p>a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two</p>",
        "<p>years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is</p>\n<p>absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings</p>\n<p>amount to £ 27 10_s_. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in</p>\n<p>the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began</p>\n<p>to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at</p>\n<p>all.</p>\n<p>“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my</p>",
        "<p>clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me</p>\n<p>upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel</p>\n<p>Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel</p>\n<p>himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding</p>\n<p>thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole</p>\n<p>face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was</p>\n<p>drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation</p>",
        "<p>seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was</p>\n<p>bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but</p>\n<p>neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than</p>\n<p>thirty.</p>\n<p>“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You have</p>\n<p>been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only</p>\n<p>proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of</p>",
        "<p>preserving a secret.’</p>\n<p>“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an</p>\n<p>address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’</p>\n<p>“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at</p>\n<p>this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan</p>\n<p>and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’</p>\n<p>“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say</p>",
        "<p>that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional</p>\n<p>qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that</p>\n<p>you wished to speak to me?’</p>\n<p>“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the</p>\n<p>point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy</p>\n<p>is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we</p>\n<p>may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in</p>",
        "<p>the bosom of his family.’</p>\n<p>“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend</p>\n<p>upon my doing so.’</p>\n<p>“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had</p>\n<p>never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.</p>\n<p>“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.</p>\n<p>“‘Yes, I promise.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference</p>\n<p>to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’</p>\n<p>“‘I have already given you my word.’</p>\n<p>“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across</p>\n<p>the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.</p>\n<p>“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are</p>\n<p>sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in</p>",
        "<p>safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at</p>\n<p>me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.</p>\n<p>“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to</p>\n<p>rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my</p>\n<p>dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my</p>\n<p>impatience.</p>\n<p>“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of</p>",
        "<p>value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to</p>\n<p>my lips.</p>\n<p>“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.</p>\n<p>“‘Most admirably.’</p>\n<p>“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I</p>\n<p>simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has</p>\n<p>got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it</p>",
        "<p>right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’</p>\n<p>“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’</p>\n<p>“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’</p>\n<p>“‘Where to?’</p>\n<p>“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of</p>\n<p>Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from</p>\n<p>Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Very good.’</p>\n<p>“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’</p>\n<p>“‘There is a drive, then?’</p>\n<p>“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven</p>\n<p>miles from Eyford Station.’</p>\n<p>“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would</p>\n<p>be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’</p>\n<p>“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’</p>\n<p>“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense</p>\n<p>you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and</p>\n<p>unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of</p>\n<p>your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the</p>\n<p>business, there is plenty of time to do so.’</p>",
        "<p>“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be</p>\n<p>to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate</p>\n<p>myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little</p>\n<p>more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’</p>\n<p>“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have</p>\n<p>exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to</p>\n<p>commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I</p>",
        "<p>suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’</p>\n<p>“‘Entirely.’</p>\n<p>“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that</p>\n<p>fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one</p>\n<p>or two places in England?’</p>\n<p>“‘I have heard so.’</p>\n<p>“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within</p>",
        "<p>ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was</p>\n<p>a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it,</p>\n<p>however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and</p>\n<p>that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right</p>\n<p>and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These</p>\n<p>good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that</p>\n<p>which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my</p>",
        "<p>interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but</p>\n<p>unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few</p>\n<p>of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we</p>\n<p>should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in</p>\n<p>this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the</p>\n<p>neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in</p>\n<p>order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This</p>",
        "<p>press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish</p>\n<p>your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,</p>\n<p>however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers</p>\n<p>coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if</p>\n<p>the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these</p>\n<p>fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise</p>\n<p>me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford</p>",
        "<p>to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’</p>\n<p>“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite</p>\n<p>understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in</p>\n<p>excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like</p>\n<p>gravel from a pit.’</p>\n<p>“‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the</p>\n<p>earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they</p>",
        "<p>are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my</p>\n<p>confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’</p>\n<p>He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’</p>\n<p>“‘I shall certainly be there.’</p>\n<p>“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last long,</p>\n<p>questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he</p>\n<p>hurried from the room.</p>",
        "<p>“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much</p>\n<p>astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had</p>\n<p>been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the</p>\n<p>fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price</p>\n<p>upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to</p>\n<p>other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had</p>\n<p>made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his</p>",
        "<p>explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the</p>\n<p>necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I</p>\n<p>should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the</p>\n<p>winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,</p>\n<p>having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.</p>\n<p>“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.</p>\n<p>However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the</p>",
        "<p>little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger</p>\n<p>who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single</p>\n<p>sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,</p>\n<p>however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow</p>\n<p>upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me</p>\n<p>into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the</p>\n<p>windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as</p>",
        "<p>fast as the horse could go.”</p>\n<p>“One horse?” interjected Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Yes, only one.”</p>\n<p>“Did you observe the colour?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the</p>\n<p>carriage. It was a chestnut.”</p>\n<p>“Tired-looking or fresh?”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, fresh and glossy.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most</p>\n<p>interesting statement.”</p>\n<p>“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander</p>\n<p>Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from</p>\n<p>the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it</p>\n<p>must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the</p>",
        "<p>time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,</p>\n<p>that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem</p>\n<p>to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and</p>\n<p>jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of</p>\n<p>where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make</p>\n<p>out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and</p>\n<p>then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but</p>",
        "<p>the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon</p>\n<p>flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for</p>\n<p>the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a</p>\n<p>stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,</p>\n<p>pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,</p>\n<p>as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I</p>\n<p>failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The</p>",
        "<p>instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily</p>\n<p>behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage</p>\n<p>drove away.</p>\n<p>“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about</p>\n<p>looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door</p>\n<p>opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light</p>\n<p>shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a</p>",
        "<p>lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face</p>\n<p>forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from</p>\n<p>the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it</p>\n<p>was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a</p>\n<p>tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a</p>\n<p>gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from</p>\n<p>her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,</p>",
        "<p>and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he</p>\n<p>walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.</p>\n<p>“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few</p>\n<p>minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,</p>\n<p>plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which</p>\n<p>several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp</p>\n<p>on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you</p>",
        "<p>waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.</p>\n<p>“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of</p>\n<p>German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the</p>\n<p>others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,</p>\n<p>hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak</p>\n<p>shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully</p>\n<p>silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the</p>",
        "<p>passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of</p>\n<p>uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and</p>\n<p>what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And</p>\n<p>where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I</p>\n<p>knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that</p>\n<p>matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that</p>\n<p>radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was</p>",
        "<p>quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the</p>\n<p>country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath</p>\n<p>to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my</p>\n<p>fifty-guinea fee.</p>\n<p>“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter</p>\n<p>stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was</p>\n<p>standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the</p>",
        "<p>yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I</p>\n<p>could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a</p>\n<p>chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be</p>\n<p>silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her</p>\n<p>eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom</p>\n<p>behind her.</p>\n<p>“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak</p>",
        "<p>calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you</p>\n<p>to do.’</p>\n<p>“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot</p>\n<p>possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’</p>\n<p>“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass</p>\n<p>through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and</p>\n<p>shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step</p>",
        "<p>forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she</p>\n<p>whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’</p>\n<p>“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage</p>\n<p>in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my</p>\n<p>fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night</p>\n<p>which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should</p>\n<p>I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the</p>",
        "<p>payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a</p>\n<p>monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had</p>\n<p>shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and</p>\n<p>declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew</p>\n<p>her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several</p>\n<p>footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw</p>\n<p>up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as</p>",
        "<p>noiselessly as she had come.</p>\n<p>“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a</p>\n<p>chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was</p>\n<p>introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.</p>\n<p>“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I</p>\n<p>was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear</p>\n<p>that you have felt the draught.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt</p>\n<p>the room to be a little close.’</p>\n<p>“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better</p>\n<p>proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you</p>\n<p>up to see the machine.’</p>\n<p>“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’</p>\n<p>“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All</p>\n<p>we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is</p>\n<p>wrong with it.’</p>\n<p>“We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat</p>\n<p>manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with</p>\n<p>corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,</p>",
        "<p>the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had</p>\n<p>crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above</p>\n<p>the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the</p>\n<p>damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put</p>\n<p>on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the</p>\n<p>warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen</p>\n<p>eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent</p>",
        "<p>man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least</p>\n<p>a fellow-countryman.</p>\n<p>“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he</p>\n<p>unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us</p>\n<p>could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the</p>\n<p>colonel ushered me in.</p>\n<p>“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it</p>",
        "<p>would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn</p>\n<p>it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the</p>\n<p>descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon</p>\n<p>this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside</p>\n<p>which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the</p>\n<p>manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but</p>\n<p>there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little</p>",
        "<p>of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to</p>\n<p>show us how we can set it right.’</p>\n<p>“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.</p>\n<p>It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous</p>\n<p>pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers</p>\n<p>which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there</p>\n<p>was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through</p>",
        "<p>one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the</p>\n<p>india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk</p>\n<p>so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was</p>\n<p>clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my</p>\n<p>companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several</p>\n<p>practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When</p>\n<p>I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the</p>",
        "<p>machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was</p>\n<p>obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest</p>\n<p>fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an</p>\n<p>engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of</p>\n<p>wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came</p>\n<p>to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I</p>\n<p>had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I</p>",
        "<p>heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of</p>\n<p>the colonel looking down at me.</p>\n<p>“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.</p>\n<p>“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that</p>\n<p>which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I</p>\n<p>think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if</p>\n<p>I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’</p>",
        "<p>“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my</p>\n<p>speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey</p>\n<p>eyes.</p>\n<p>“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took</p>\n<p>a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the</p>\n<p>lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite</p>\n<p>secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’</p>",
        "<p>I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’</p>\n<p>“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart</p>\n<p>into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the</p>\n<p>leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood</p>\n<p>upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its</p>\n<p>light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,</p>\n<p>jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must</p>",
        "<p>within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,</p>\n<p>screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I</p>\n<p>implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the</p>\n<p>levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my</p>\n<p>head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.</p>\n<p>Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend</p>\n<p>very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the</p>",
        "<p>weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that</p>\n<p>dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve</p>\n<p>to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?</p>\n<p>Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which</p>\n<p>brought a gush of hope back to my heart.</p>\n<p>“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls</p>\n<p>were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line</p>",
        "<p>of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and</p>\n<p>broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could</p>\n<p>hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.</p>\n<p>The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the</p>\n<p>other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the</p>\n<p>lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,</p>\n<p>told me how narrow had been my escape.</p>",
        "<p>“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I</p>\n<p>found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a</p>\n<p>woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held</p>\n<p>a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had</p>\n<p>so foolishly rejected.</p>\n<p>“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.</p>\n<p>They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious</p>",
        "<p>time, but come!’</p>\n<p>“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my</p>\n<p>feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The</p>\n<p>latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard</p>\n<p>the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering</p>\n<p>the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My</p>\n<p>guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit’s end.</p>",
        "<p>Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window</p>\n<p>of which the moon was shining brightly.</p>\n<p>“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that</p>\n<p>you can jump it.’</p>\n<p>“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the</p>\n<p>passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing</p>\n<p>forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s</p>",
        "<p>cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the</p>\n<p>window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden</p>\n<p>looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet</p>\n<p>down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I</p>\n<p>should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who</p>\n<p>pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to</p>\n<p>go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my</p>",
        "<p>mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw</p>\n<p>her arms round him and tried to hold him back.</p>\n<p>“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the</p>\n<p>last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he</p>\n<p>will be silent!’</p>\n<p>“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.</p>\n<p>‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’</p>",
        "<p>He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with</p>\n<p>his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to</p>\n<p>the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip</p>\n<p>loosened, and I fell into the garden below.</p>\n<p>“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and</p>\n<p>rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood</p>\n<p>that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I</p>",
        "<p>ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my</p>\n<p>hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw</p>\n<p>that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my</p>\n<p>wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a</p>\n<p>sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among</p>\n<p>the rose-bushes.</p>\n<p>“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a</p>",
        "<p>very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was</p>\n<p>breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,</p>\n<p>and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The</p>\n<p>smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s</p>\n<p>adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly</p>\n<p>yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to</p>\n<p>look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been</p>",
        "<p>lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little</p>\n<p>lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,</p>\n<p>to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.</p>\n<p>Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during</p>\n<p>those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.</p>\n<p>“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.</p>\n<p>There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was</p>",
        "<p>on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him</p>\n<p>whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was</p>\n<p>strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for</p>\n<p>me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was</p>\n<p>one about three miles off.</p>\n<p>“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to</p>\n<p>wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It</p>",
        "<p>was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound</p>\n<p>dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I</p>\n<p>put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”</p>\n<p>We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this</p>\n<p>extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the</p>\n<p>shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his</p>\n<p>cuttings.</p>",
        "<p>“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It</p>\n<p>appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on</p>\n<p>the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic</p>\n<p>engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been</p>\n<p>heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the</p>\n<p>last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I</p>\n<p>fancy.”</p>",
        "<p>“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl</p>\n<p>said.”</p>\n<p>“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and</p>\n<p>desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand</p>\n<p>in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will</p>\n<p>leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is</p>\n<p>precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard</p>",
        "<p>at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.”</p>\n<p>Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,</p>\n<p>bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock</p>\n<p>Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,</p>\n<p>a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map</p>\n<p>of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing</p>\n<p>a circle with Eyford for its centre.</p>",
        "<p>“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten</p>\n<p>miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that</p>\n<p>line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”</p>\n<p>“It was an hour’s good drive.”</p>\n<p>“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were</p>\n<p>unconscious?”</p>\n<p>“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been</p>",
        "<p>lifted and conveyed somewhere.”</p>\n<p>“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you</p>\n<p>when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain</p>\n<p>was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”</p>\n<p>“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my</p>\n<p>life.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have</p>",
        "<p>drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk</p>\n<p>that we are in search of are to be found.”</p>\n<p>“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes quietly.</p>\n<p>“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!</p>\n<p>Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the</p>\n<p>country is more deserted there.”</p>\n<p>“And I say east,” said my patient.</p>",
        "<p>“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several</p>\n<p>quiet little villages up there.”</p>\n<p>“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and</p>\n<p>our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”</p>\n<p>“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of</p>\n<p>opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your</p>\n<p>casting vote to?”</p>",
        "<p>“You are all wrong.”</p>\n<p>“But we can’t all be.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the</p>\n<p>centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”</p>\n<p>“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.</p>\n<p>“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse</p>\n<p>was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had</p>",
        "<p>gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>“Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”</p>\n<p>“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and</p>\n<p>have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of</p>\n<p>silver.”</p>\n<p>“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the</p>",
        "<p>inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We</p>\n<p>even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they</p>\n<p>had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old</p>\n<p>hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got</p>\n<p>them right enough.”</p>\n<p>But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined</p>\n<p>to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we</p>",
        "<p>saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small</p>\n<p>clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich</p>\n<p>feather over the landscape.</p>\n<p>“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on</p>\n<p>its way.</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.</p>\n<p>“When did it break out?”</p>",
        "<p>“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and</p>\n<p>the whole place is in a blaze.”</p>\n<p>“Whose house is it?”</p>\n<p>“Dr. Becher’s.”</p>\n<p>“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin,</p>\n<p>with a long, sharp nose?”</p>\n<p>The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an</p>",
        "<p>Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined</p>\n<p>waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I</p>\n<p>understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good</p>\n<p>Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”</p>\n<p>The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all</p>\n<p>hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and</p>\n<p>there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,</p>",
        "<p>spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front</p>\n<p>three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.</p>\n<p>“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the</p>\n<p>gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second</p>\n<p>window is the one that I jumped from.”</p>\n<p>“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.</p>\n<p>There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was</p>",
        "<p>crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt</p>\n<p>they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.</p>\n<p>Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,</p>\n<p>though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”</p>\n<p>And Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no</p>\n<p>word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister</p>\n<p>German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met</p>",
        "<p>a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving</p>\n<p>rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the</p>\n<p>fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to</p>\n<p>discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.</p>\n<p>The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which</p>\n<p>they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed</p>\n<p>human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,</p>",
        "<p>however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the</p>\n<p>flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been</p>\n<p>reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and</p>\n<p>iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our</p>\n<p>unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin</p>\n<p>were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,</p>\n<p>which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have</p>",
        "<p>been already referred to.</p>\n<p>How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the</p>\n<p>spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a</p>\n<p>mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain</p>\n<p>tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom</p>\n<p>had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the</p>\n<p>whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold</p>",
        "<p>or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear</p>\n<p>the unconscious man out of the way of danger.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once</p>\n<p>more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my</p>\n<p>thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”</p>\n<p>“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value,</p>\n<p>you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of</p>",
        "<p>being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”</p>",
        "<h3>The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor</h3>\n<p>X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR</p>\n<p>The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long</p>\n<p>ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which</p>\n<p>the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and</p>\n<p>their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this</p>\n<p>four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the</p>",
        "<p>full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my</p>\n<p>friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter</p>\n<p>up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little</p>\n<p>sketch of this remarkable episode.</p>\n<p>It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was</p>\n<p>still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from</p>\n<p>an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I</p>",
        "<p>had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn</p>\n<p>to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had</p>\n<p>brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign</p>\n<p>throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my</p>\n<p>legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers</p>\n<p>until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all</p>\n<p>aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the</p>",
        "<p>envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble</p>\n<p>correspondent could be.</p>\n<p>“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked as he entered. “Your</p>\n<p>morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a</p>\n<p>tide-waiter.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he</p>\n<p>answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.</p>",
        "<p>This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon</p>\n<p>a man either to be bored or to lie.”</p>\n<p>He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.</p>\n<p>“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Not social, then?”</p>\n<p>“No, distinctly professional.”</p>\n<p>“And from a noble client?”</p>",
        "<p>“One of the highest in England.”</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”</p>\n<p>“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my</p>\n<p>client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.</p>\n<p>It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this</p>\n<p>new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,</p>\n<p>have you not?”</p>",
        "<p>“It looks like it,” said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the</p>\n<p>corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”</p>\n<p>“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read</p>\n<p>nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is</p>\n<p>always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely</p>\n<p>you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.”</p>",
        "<p>“That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.</p>\n<p>Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these</p>\n<p>papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he</p>\n<p>says:</p>\n<p>“‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I may</p>\n<p>place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have</p>\n<p>determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in</p>",
        "<p>reference to the very painful event which has occurred in</p>\n<p>connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is</p>\n<p>acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no</p>\n<p>objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it</p>\n<p>might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the</p>\n<p>afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,</p>\n<p>I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount</p>",
        "<p>importance. Yours faithfully,</p>\n<p>“‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’</p>\n<p>“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the</p>\n<p>noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer</p>\n<p>side of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes as he folded up the</p>\n<p>epistle.</p>\n<p>“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the</p>\n<p>subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order</p>\n<p>of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He picked a</p>\n<p>red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the</p>\n<p>mantelpiece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it out</p>\n<p>upon his knee. “‘Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son</p>\n<p>of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief</p>",
        "<p>over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is</p>\n<p>mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late</p>\n<p>administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for</p>\n<p>Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and</p>\n<p>Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive</p>\n<p>in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more</p>\n<p>solid.”</p>",
        "<p>“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for</p>\n<p>the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I</p>\n<p>feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry</p>\n<p>on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.</p>\n<p>That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the</p>\n<p>first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”</p>",
        "<p>“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal</p>\n<p>column of the _Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back:</p>\n<p>‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is</p>\n<p>correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second</p>\n<p>son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of</p>\n<p>Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”</p>\n<p>“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin</p>",
        "<p>legs towards the fire.</p>\n<p>“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of</p>\n<p>the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for</p>\n<p>protection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade</p>\n<p>principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one</p>\n<p>the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the</p>\n<p>hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important</p>",
        "<p>addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes</p>\n<p>which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,</p>\n<p>who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little</p>\n<p>god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage</p>\n<p>with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California</p>\n<p>millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face</p>\n<p>attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only</p>",
        "<p>child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to</p>\n<p>considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As</p>\n<p>it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to</p>\n<p>sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has</p>\n<p>no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is</p>\n<p>obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an</p>\n<p>alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition</p>",
        "<p>from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”</p>\n<p>“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to</p>\n<p>say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would</p>\n<p>be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate</p>\n<p>friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the</p>\n<p>furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius</p>",
        "<p>Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt</p>\n<p>announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon</p>\n<p>would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are</p>\n<p>all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”</p>\n<p>“Before the what?” asked Holmes with a start.</p>\n<p>“The vanishing of the lady.”</p>\n<p>“When did she vanish, then?”</p>",
        "<p>“At the wedding breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite</p>\n<p>dramatic, in fact.”</p>\n<p>“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”</p>\n<p>“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the</p>\n<p>honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.</p>\n<p>Pray let me have the details.”</p>",
        "<p>“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps we may make them less so.”</p>\n<p>“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning</p>\n<p>paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular</p>\n<p>Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:</p>\n<p>“‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest</p>\n<p>consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken</p>",
        "<p>place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly</p>\n<p>announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;</p>\n<p>but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange</p>\n<p>rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the</p>\n<p>attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention</p>\n<p>has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by</p>\n<p>affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.</p>",
        "<p>“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,</p>\n<p>was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the</p>\n<p>bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,</p>\n<p>Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister</p>\n<p>of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party</p>\n<p>proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster</p>\n<p>Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little</p>",
        "<p>trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who</p>\n<p>endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,</p>\n<p>alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after</p>\n<p>a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and</p>\n<p>the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before</p>\n<p>this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,</p>\n<p>when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.</p>",
        "<p>Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed</p>\n<p>her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber</p>\n<p>for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the</p>\n<p>passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the</p>\n<p>house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his</p>\n<p>mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that</p>\n<p>his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with</p>",
        "<p>the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the</p>\n<p>police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will</p>\n<p>probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.</p>\n<p>Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the</p>\n<p>whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the</p>\n<p>matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the</p>\n<p>woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from</p>",
        "<p>jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the</p>\n<p>strange disappearance of the bride.’”</p>\n<p>“And is that all?”</p>\n<p>“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a</p>\n<p>suggestive one.”</p>\n<p>“And it is—”</p>\n<p>“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has</p>",
        "<p>actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_</p>\n<p>at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.</p>\n<p>There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands</p>\n<p>now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”</p>\n<p>“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have</p>\n<p>missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as</p>\n<p>the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this</p>",
        "<p>will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I</p>\n<p>very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own</p>\n<p>memory.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the</p>\n<p>door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed</p>\n<p>and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with</p>\n<p>the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever</p>",
        "<p>been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his</p>\n<p>general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight</p>\n<p>forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,</p>\n<p>too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the</p>\n<p>edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the</p>\n<p>verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white</p>\n<p>waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured</p>",
        "<p>gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left</p>\n<p>to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden</p>\n<p>eyeglasses.</p>\n<p>“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take</p>\n<p>the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up</p>\n<p>a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”</p>\n<p>“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have</p>\n<p>already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I</p>\n<p>presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”</p>\n<p>“No, I am descending.”</p>\n<p>“I beg pardon.”</p>\n<p>“My last client of the sort was a king.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”</p>",
        "<p>“The King of Scandinavia.”</p>\n<p>“What! Had he lost his wife?”</p>\n<p>“You can understand,” said Holmes suavely, “that I extend to the</p>\n<p>affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in</p>\n<p>yours.”</p>\n<p>“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own</p>\n<p>case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in</p>",
        "<p>forming an opinion.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,</p>\n<p>nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for</p>\n<p>example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”</p>\n<p>Lord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it</p>\n<p>goes.”</p>\n<p>“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer</p>",
        "<p>an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by</p>\n<p>questioning you.”</p>\n<p>“Pray do so.”</p>\n<p>“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”</p>\n<p>“In San Francisco, a year ago.”</p>\n<p>“You were travelling in the States?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>",
        "<p>“Did you become engaged then?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“But you were on a friendly footing?”</p>\n<p>“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”</p>\n<p>“Her father is very rich?”</p>\n<p>“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”</p>\n<p>“And how did he make his money?”</p>",
        "<p>“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,</p>\n<p>invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”</p>\n<p>“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s</p>\n<p>character?”</p>\n<p>The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the</p>\n<p>fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her</p>\n<p>father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining</p>",
        "<p>camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has</p>\n<p>come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call</p>\n<p>in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by</p>\n<p>any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say.</p>\n<p>She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her</p>\n<p>resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name</p>\n<p>which I have the honour to bear”—he gave a little stately cough—“had I</p>",
        "<p>not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is</p>\n<p>capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would</p>\n<p>be repugnant to her.”</p>\n<p>“Have you her photograph?”</p>\n<p>“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket and showed us the full</p>\n<p>face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory</p>\n<p>miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the</p>",
        "<p>lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.</p>\n<p>Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and</p>\n<p>handed it back to Lord St. Simon.</p>\n<p>“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your</p>\n<p>acquaintance?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met</p>\n<p>her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”</p>",
        "<p>“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”</p>\n<p>“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”</p>\n<p>“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait</p>\n<p>accompli_?”</p>\n<p>“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”</p>\n<p>“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the</p>\n<p>wedding?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Was she in good spirits?”</p>\n<p>“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future</p>\n<p>lives.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”</p>\n<p>“She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.”</p>\n<p>“And did you observe any change in her then?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever</p>\n<p>seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was</p>\n<p>too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.”</p>\n<p>“Pray let us have it, for all that.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the</p>\n<p>vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over</p>\n<p>into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew</p>",
        "<p>handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for</p>\n<p>the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me</p>\n<p>abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly</p>\n<p>agitated over this trifling cause.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the</p>\n<p>general public were present, then?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”</p>",
        "<p>“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”</p>\n<p>“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a</p>\n<p>common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I</p>\n<p>think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”</p>\n<p>“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful</p>\n<p>frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering</p>\n<p>her father’s house?”</p>",
        "<p>“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”</p>\n<p>“And who is her maid?”</p>\n<p>“Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with</p>\n<p>her.”</p>\n<p>“A confidential servant?”</p>\n<p>“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to</p>\n<p>take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these</p>",
        "<p>things in a different way.”</p>\n<p>“How long did she speak to this Alice?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”</p>\n<p>“You did not overhear what they said?”</p>\n<p>“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was</p>\n<p>accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”</p>\n<p>“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do</p>",
        "<p>when she finished speaking to her maid?”</p>\n<p>“She walked into the breakfast-room.”</p>\n<p>“On your arm?”</p>\n<p>“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,</p>\n<p>after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,</p>\n<p>muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came</p>\n<p>back.”</p>",
        "<p>“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her</p>\n<p>room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,</p>\n<p>and went out.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in</p>\n<p>company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had</p>\n<p>already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and</p>",
        "<p>your relations to her.”</p>\n<p>Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We have</p>\n<p>been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a _very_</p>\n<p>friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her</p>\n<p>ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but</p>\n<p>you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but</p>\n<p>exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me</p>",
        "<p>dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to</p>\n<p>tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly</p>\n<p>was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came</p>\n<p>to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push</p>\n<p>her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even</p>\n<p>threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the</p>\n<p>sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon</p>",
        "<p>pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good</p>\n<p>in making a row.”</p>\n<p>“Did your wife hear all this?”</p>\n<p>“No, thank goodness, she did not.”</p>\n<p>“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so</p>\n<p>serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some</p>",
        "<p>terrible trap for her.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it is a possible supposition.”</p>\n<p>“You think so, too?”</p>\n<p>“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this</p>\n<p>as likely?”</p>\n<p>“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”</p>\n<p>“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is</p>",
        "<p>your own theory as to what took place?”</p>\n<p>“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have</p>\n<p>given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it</p>\n<p>has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the</p>\n<p>consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the</p>\n<p>effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”</p>\n<p>“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not</p>\n<p>say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without</p>\n<p>success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”</p>\n<p>“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes,</p>\n<p>smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my</p>\n<p>data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that</p>\n<p>you could see out of the window?”</p>",
        "<p>“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I</p>\n<p>shall communicate with you.”</p>\n<p>“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our</p>\n<p>client, rising.</p>\n<p>“I have solved it.”</p>\n<p>“Eh? What was that?”</p>",
        "<p>“I say that I have solved it.”</p>\n<p>“Where, then, is my wife?”</p>\n<p>“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”</p>\n<p>Lord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser</p>\n<p>heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,</p>\n<p>old-fashioned manner he departed.</p>\n<p>“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a</p>",
        "<p>level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think that I</p>\n<p>shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this</p>\n<p>cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before</p>\n<p>our client came into the room.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Holmes!”</p>\n<p>“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked</p>\n<p>before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn</p>",
        "<p>my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally</p>\n<p>very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote</p>\n<p>Thoreau’s example.”</p>\n<p>“But I have heard all that you have heard.”</p>\n<p>“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me</p>\n<p>so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and</p>\n<p>something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the</p>",
        "<p>Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is</p>\n<p>Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon</p>\n<p>the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”</p>\n<p>The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which</p>\n<p>gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas</p>\n<p>bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the</p>\n<p>cigar which had been offered to him.</p>",
        "<p>“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look</p>\n<p>dissatisfied.”</p>\n<p>“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.</p>\n<p>I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”</p>\n<p>“Really! You surprise me.”</p>\n<p>“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip</p>\n<p>through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”</p>",
        "<p>“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his hand</p>\n<p>upon the arm of the pea-jacket.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”</p>\n<p>“In Heaven’s name, what for?”</p>\n<p>“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</p>\n<p>“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.</p>",
        "<p>“Why? What do you mean?”</p>\n<p>“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one</p>\n<p>as in the other.”</p>\n<p>Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all</p>\n<p>about it,” he snarled.</p>\n<p>“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the</p>",
        "<p>matter?”</p>\n<p>“I think it very unlikely.”</p>\n<p>“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in</p>\n<p>it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a</p>\n<p>wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a</p>\n<p>bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,”</p>\n<p>said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is</p>",
        "<p>a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You</p>\n<p>dragged them from the Serpentine?”</p>\n<p>“No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They</p>\n<p>have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the</p>\n<p>clothes were there the body would not be far off.”</p>\n<p>“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in</p>",
        "<p>the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive</p>\n<p>at through this?”</p>\n<p>“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”</p>\n<p>“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”</p>\n<p>“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade with some bitterness. “I am</p>\n<p>afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions</p>\n<p>and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.</p>",
        "<p>This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”</p>\n<p>“And how?”</p>\n<p>“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the</p>\n<p>card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down</p>\n<p>upon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when</p>\n<p>all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been</p>\n<p>that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,</p>",
        "<p>with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.</p>\n<p>Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt</p>\n<p>quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within</p>\n<p>their reach.”</p>\n<p>“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine</p>\n<p>indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but his</p>\n<p>attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of</p>",
        "<p>satisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.</p>\n<p>“Ha! you find it so?”</p>\n<p>“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”</p>\n<p>Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he</p>\n<p>shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”</p>\n<p>“On the contrary, this is the right side.”</p>\n<p>“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over</p>",
        "<p>here.”</p>\n<p>“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,</p>\n<p>which interests me deeply.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct.</p>\n<p>4th, rooms 8_s_., breakfast 2_s_. 6_d_., cocktail 1_s_., lunch 2_s_.</p>\n<p>6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.’ I see nothing in that.”</p>\n<p>“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,</p>",
        "<p>it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate</p>\n<p>you again.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard</p>\n<p>work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,</p>\n<p>Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter</p>\n<p>first.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made</p>\n<p>for the door.</p>",
        "<p>“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes before his rival</p>\n<p>vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.</p>\n<p>Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such</p>\n<p>person.”</p>\n<p>Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his</p>\n<p>forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.</p>\n<p>He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his</p>",
        "<p>overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor</p>\n<p>work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your</p>\n<p>papers for a little.”</p>\n<p>It was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no</p>\n<p>time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s</p>\n<p>man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a</p>\n<p>youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great</p>",
        "<p>astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out</p>\n<p>upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of</p>\n<p>cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie with a group of</p>\n<p>ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my</p>\n<p>two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with</p>\n<p>no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered</p>\n<p>to this address.</p>",
        "<p>Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.</p>\n<p>His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which</p>\n<p>made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.</p>\n<p>“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.</p>\n<p>“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am</p>\n<p>surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that</p>",
        "<p>I hear his step now upon the stairs.”</p>\n<p>It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,</p>\n<p>dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very</p>\n<p>perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.</p>\n<p>“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.</p>\n<p>“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have</p>\n<p>you good authority for what you say?”</p>",
        "<p>“The best possible.”</p>\n<p>Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.</p>\n<p>“What will the Duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the</p>\n<p>family has been subjected to such humiliation?”</p>\n<p>“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any</p>\n<p>humiliation.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.”</p>",
        "<p>“I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady</p>\n<p>could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was</p>\n<p>undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise</p>\n<p>her at such a crisis.”</p>\n<p>“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping</p>\n<p>his fingers upon the table.</p>\n<p>“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented</p>",
        "<p>a position.”</p>\n<p>“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been</p>\n<p>shamefully used.”</p>\n<p>“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on</p>\n<p>the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the</p>\n<p>matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more</p>\n<p>successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.</p>",
        "<p>“Lord St. Simon,” said he “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”</p>\n<p>At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and</p>\n<p>stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the</p>\n<p>breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had</p>\n<p>taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he</p>\n<p>still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,</p>",
        "<p>perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.</p>\n<p>“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause</p>\n<p>to be.”</p>\n<p>“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon bitterly.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should</p>\n<p>have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from</p>\n<p>the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was</p>",
        "<p>doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right</p>\n<p>there before the altar.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the</p>\n<p>room while you explain this matter?”</p>\n<p>“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had</p>\n<p>just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,</p>\n<p>I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was</p>",
        "<p>a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert</p>\n<p>manner.</p>\n<p>“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I</p>\n<p>met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a</p>\n<p>claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day</p>\n<p>father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had</p>\n<p>a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the</p>",
        "<p>poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting</p>\n<p>any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up his</p>\n<p>hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing</p>\n<p>anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just</p>\n<p>fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his</p>\n<p>pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.</p>\n<p>So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged</p>",
        "<p>myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be</p>\n<p>married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you;</p>\n<p>and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we</p>\n<p>talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman</p>\n<p>all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank</p>\n<p>went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.</p>\n<p>“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went</p>",
        "<p>prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After</p>\n<p>that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been</p>\n<p>attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the</p>\n<p>killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa</p>\n<p>thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not</p>\n<p>a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that</p>\n<p>Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we came</p>",
        "<p>to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I</p>\n<p>felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place</p>\n<p>in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.</p>\n<p>“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my</p>\n<p>duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went</p>\n<p>to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a</p>\n<p>wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just</p>",
        "<p>as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and</p>\n<p>looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at</p>\n<p>first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of</p>\n<p>question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to</p>\n<p>see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning</p>\n<p>round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee</p>\n<p>in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make</p>",
        "<p>a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know</p>\n<p>what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to</p>\n<p>be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that</p>\n<p>he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped</p>\n<p>my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he</p>\n<p>returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when</p>\n<p>he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment</p>",
        "<p>that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever</p>\n<p>he might direct.</p>\n<p>“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and</p>\n<p>had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a</p>\n<p>few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to</p>\n<p>Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all</p>\n<p>those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain</p>",
        "<p>afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank</p>\n<p>out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and</p>\n<p>then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and</p>\n<p>followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.</p>\n<p>Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little</p>\n<p>secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from</p>\n<p>her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we</p>",
        "<p>drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my</p>\n<p>true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a</p>\n<p>prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that</p>\n<p>I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,</p>\n<p>and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”</p>\n<p>“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and</p>\n<p>the church but not where the lady lived.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for</p>\n<p>openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should</p>\n<p>like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line</p>\n<p>to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to</p>\n<p>think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table</p>\n<p>and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and</p>\n<p>things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and</p>",
        "<p>dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely</p>\n<p>that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good</p>\n<p>gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he</p>\n<p>found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and</p>\n<p>kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be</p>\n<p>putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to</p>\n<p>give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came</p>",
        "<p>right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it</p>\n<p>all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you</p>\n<p>do not think very meanly of me.”</p>\n<p>Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had</p>\n<p>listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long</p>\n<p>narrative.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most</p>",
        "<p>intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”</p>\n<p>“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand</p>\n<p>and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.</p>\n<p>“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a</p>\n<p>friendly supper.”</p>\n<p>“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his Lordship.</p>",
        "<p>“I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can</p>\n<p>hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your</p>\n<p>permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us</p>\n<p>all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.</p>\n<p>“Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,” said</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,</p>\n<p>for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the</p>",
        "<p>blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our</p>\n<p>children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country</p>\n<p>under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the</p>\n<p>Stars and Stripes.”</p>\n<p>“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes when our</p>\n<p>visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how</p>\n<p>simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems</p>",
        "<p>to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the</p>\n<p>sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than</p>\n<p>the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland</p>\n<p>Yard.”</p>\n<p>“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”</p>\n<p>“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the</p>\n<p>lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other</p>",
        "<p>that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.</p>\n<p>Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her</p>\n<p>to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have</p>\n<p>spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of</p>\n<p>the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be</p>\n<p>someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this</p>\n<p>country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an</p>",
        "<p>influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to</p>\n<p>change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a</p>\n<p>process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.</p>\n<p>Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much</p>\n<p>influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her</p>\n<p>young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under</p>\n<p>strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.</p>",
        "<p>Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in</p>\n<p>the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as</p>\n<p>the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and</p>\n<p>of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’</p>\n<p>parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a</p>\n<p>prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had</p>\n<p>gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous</p>",
        "<p>husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.”</p>\n<p>“And how in the world did you find them?”</p>\n<p>“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in</p>\n<p>his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials</p>\n<p>were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was</p>\n<p>it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the</p>\n<p>most select London hotels.”</p>",
        "<p>“How did you deduce the select?”</p>\n<p>“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a</p>\n<p>glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are</p>\n<p>not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I</p>\n<p>visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the</p>\n<p>book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the</p>\n<p>day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon</p>",
        "<p>the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were</p>\n<p>to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being</p>\n<p>fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give</p>\n<p>them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be</p>\n<p>better in every way that they should make their position a little</p>\n<p>clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.</p>\n<p>I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the</p>",
        "<p>appointment.”</p>\n<p>“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly</p>\n<p>not very gracious.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very</p>\n<p>gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you</p>\n<p>found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think</p>\n<p>that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars</p>",
        "<p>that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw</p>\n<p>your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still</p>\n<p>to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”</p>",
        "<h3>The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet</h3>\n<p>XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET</p>\n<p>“Holmes,” said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down</p>\n<p>the street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that</p>\n<p>his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”</p>\n<p>My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the</p>\n<p>pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a</p>",
        "<p>bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still</p>\n<p>lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down</p>\n<p>the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly</p>\n<p>band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of</p>\n<p>the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement</p>\n<p>had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so</p>\n<p>that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction</p>",
        "<p>of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman</p>\n<p>whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.</p>\n<p>He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a</p>\n<p>massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed</p>\n<p>in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat</p>\n<p>brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were</p>\n<p>in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was</p>",
        "<p>running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives</p>\n<p>who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he</p>\n<p>jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face</p>\n<p>into the most extraordinary contortions.</p>\n<p>“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up</p>\n<p>at the numbers of the houses.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.</p>",
        "<p>“Here?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think</p>\n<p>that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke,</p>\n<p>the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell</p>\n<p>until the whole house resounded with the clanging.</p>\n<p>A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still</p>\n<p>gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his</p>",
        "<p>eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For</p>\n<p>a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked</p>\n<p>at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his</p>\n<p>reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against</p>\n<p>the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away</p>\n<p>to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the</p>\n<p>easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with</p>",
        "<p>him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.</p>\n<p>“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You</p>\n<p>are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered</p>\n<p>yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little</p>\n<p>problem which you may submit to me.”</p>\n<p>The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against</p>\n<p>his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his</p>",
        "<p>lips tight, and turned his face towards us.</p>\n<p>“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.</p>\n<p>“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.</p>\n<p>“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so</p>\n<p>sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,</p>\n<p>although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.</p>\n<p>Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming</p>",
        "<p>together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very</p>\n<p>soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may</p>\n<p>suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”</p>\n<p>“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear</p>\n<p>account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.”</p>\n<p>“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears. I</p>\n<p>am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of</p>",
        "<p>Threadneedle Street.”</p>\n<p>The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner</p>\n<p>in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.</p>\n<p>What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens</p>\n<p>of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until</p>\n<p>with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.</p>\n<p>“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened here</p>",
        "<p>when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your</p>\n<p>co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried</p>\n<p>from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is</p>\n<p>why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little</p>\n<p>exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as</p>\n<p>shortly and yet as clearly as I can.</p>\n<p>“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking</p>",
        "<p>business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative</p>\n<p>investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the</p>\n<p>number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out</p>\n<p>money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We</p>\n<p>have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and</p>\n<p>there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon</p>\n<p>the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.</p>",
        "<p>“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card</p>\n<p>was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the</p>\n<p>name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I</p>\n<p>had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household</p>\n<p>word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names</p>\n<p>in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he</p>\n<p>entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air</p>",
        "<p>of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.</p>\n<p>“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit</p>\n<p>of advancing money.’</p>\n<p>“‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.</p>\n<p>“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £</p>\n<p>50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times</p>\n<p>over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business</p>",
        "<p>and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily</p>\n<p>understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’</p>\n<p>“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.</p>\n<p>“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most</p>\n<p>certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it</p>\n<p>right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should</p>\n<p>be paid at once.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own</p>\n<p>private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather</p>\n<p>more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the</p>\n<p>name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,</p>\n<p>even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’</p>\n<p>“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square,</p>\n<p>black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have</p>",
        "<p>doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’</p>\n<p>“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.</p>\n<p>“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,</p>\n<p>flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he</p>\n<p>had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the</p>\n<p>price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would</p>\n<p>put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am</p>",
        "<p>prepared to leave it with you as my security.’</p>\n<p>“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity</p>\n<p>from it to my illustrious client.</p>\n<p>“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.</p>\n<p>“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’</p>\n<p>“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about</p>\n<p>that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain</p>",
        "<p>that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter</p>\n<p>of form. Is the security sufficient?’</p>\n<p>“‘Ample.’</p>\n<p>“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of</p>\n<p>the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard</p>\n<p>of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all</p>\n<p>gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with</p>",
        "<p>every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public</p>\n<p>scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it</p>\n<p>would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no</p>\n<p>beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to</p>\n<p>replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and</p>\n<p>I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’</p>\n<p>“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,</p>",
        "<p>calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes.</p>\n<p>When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon</p>\n<p>the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of</p>\n<p>the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no</p>\n<p>doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would</p>\n<p>ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having</p>\n<p>ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter</p>",
        "<p>the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once</p>\n<p>more to my work.</p>\n<p>“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so</p>\n<p>precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been</p>\n<p>forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible</p>\n<p>would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,</p>\n<p>therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case</p>",
        "<p>backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of</p>\n<p>my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house</p>\n<p>at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely</p>\n<p>until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my</p>\n<p>dressing-room.</p>\n<p>“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to</p>\n<p>thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of</p>",
        "<p>the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants</p>\n<p>who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability</p>\n<p>is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,</p>\n<p>has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent</p>\n<p>character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very</p>\n<p>pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about</p>\n<p>the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we</p>",
        "<p>believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.</p>\n<p>“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will</p>\n<p>not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son,</p>\n<p>Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous</p>\n<p>disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell</p>\n<p>me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died</p>\n<p>I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile</p>",
        "<p>fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,</p>\n<p>but I meant it for the best.</p>\n<p>“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my</p>\n<p>business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,</p>\n<p>to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums</p>\n<p>of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,</p>",
        "<p>and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a</p>\n<p>number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play</p>\n<p>heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again</p>\n<p>and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his</p>\n<p>allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than</p>\n<p>once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but</p>\n<p>each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough</p>",
        "<p>to draw him back again.</p>\n<p>“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell</p>\n<p>should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to</p>\n<p>my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the</p>\n<p>fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world</p>\n<p>to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a</p>\n<p>brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think</p>",
        "<p>of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am</p>\n<p>convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in</p>\n<p>his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,</p>\n<p>and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight</p>\n<p>into character.</p>\n<p>“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when</p>\n<p>my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I</p>",
        "<p>adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is</p>\n<p>a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and</p>\n<p>housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.</p>\n<p>She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In</p>\n<p>only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has</p>\n<p>asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she</p>\n<p>has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the</p>",
        "<p>right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have</p>\n<p>changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—forever too late!</p>\n<p>“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I</p>\n<p>shall continue with my miserable story.</p>\n<p>“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after</p>\n<p>dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious</p>\n<p>treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my</p>",
        "<p>client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left</p>\n<p>the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur</p>\n<p>were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I</p>\n<p>thought it better not to disturb it.</p>\n<p>“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.</p>\n<p>“‘In my own bureau.’</p>\n<p>“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the</p>",
        "<p>night.’ said he.</p>\n<p>“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have</p>\n<p>opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’</p>\n<p>“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what</p>\n<p>he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very</p>\n<p>grave face.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me</p>\n<p>have £ 200?’</p>\n<p>“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with</p>\n<p>you in money matters.’</p>\n<p>“‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or</p>\n<p>else I can never show my face inside the club again.’</p>\n<p>“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he.</p>\n<p>‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and</p>\n<p>if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’</p>\n<p>“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You</p>\n<p>shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left</p>\n<p>the room without another word.</p>\n<p>“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was</p>",
        "<p>safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see</p>\n<p>that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I</p>\n<p>thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs</p>\n<p>I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and</p>\n<p>fastened as I approached.</p>\n<p>“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did</p>\n<p>you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Certainly not.’</p>\n<p>“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has</p>\n<p>only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is</p>\n<p>hardly safe and should be stopped.’</p>\n<p>“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are</p>\n<p>you sure that everything is fastened?’</p>\n<p>“‘Quite sure, dad.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,</p>\n<p>where I was soon asleep.</p>\n<p>“I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have</p>\n<p>any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any</p>\n<p>point which I do not make clear.”</p>\n<p>“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”</p>\n<p>“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be</p>",
        "<p>particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my</p>\n<p>mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in</p>\n<p>the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had</p>\n<p>ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as</p>\n<p>though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all</p>\n<p>my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of</p>\n<p>footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all</p>",
        "<p>palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room</p>\n<p>door.</p>\n<p>“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that</p>\n<p>coronet?’</p>\n<p>“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed</p>\n<p>only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding</p>\n<p>the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending</p>",
        "<p>it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and</p>\n<p>turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the</p>\n<p>gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.</p>\n<p>“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have</p>\n<p>destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels</p>\n<p>which you have stolen?’</p>\n<p>“‘Stolen!’ he cried.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.</p>\n<p>“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you</p>\n<p>a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another</p>\n<p>piece?’</p>\n<p>“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any</p>\n<p>longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you</p>",
        "<p>have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and</p>\n<p>make my own way in the world.’</p>\n<p>“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with</p>\n<p>grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’</p>\n<p>“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I</p>\n<p>should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the</p>\n<p>police, let the police find what they can.’</p>",
        "<p>“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in</p>\n<p>my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of</p>\n<p>the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a</p>\n<p>scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the</p>\n<p>police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the</p>\n<p>inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood</p>\n<p>sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to</p>",
        "<p>charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private</p>\n<p>matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was</p>\n<p>national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in</p>\n<p>everything.</p>\n<p>“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would</p>\n<p>be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for</p>\n<p>five minutes.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have</p>\n<p>stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I</p>\n<p>was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that</p>\n<p>of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened</p>\n<p>to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it</p>\n<p>all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing</p>\n<p>stones.</p>",
        "<p>“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in</p>\n<p>the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you</p>\n<p>but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the</p>\n<p>beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’</p>\n<p>“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning</p>\n<p>away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words</p>\n<p>of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the</p>",
        "<p>inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only</p>\n<p>of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where</p>\n<p>he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could</p>\n<p>be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our</p>\n<p>persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and</p>\n<p>I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round</p>\n<p>to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The</p>",
        "<p>police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of</p>\n<p>it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already</p>\n<p>offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my</p>\n<p>honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”</p>\n<p>He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,</p>\n<p>droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted</p>",
        "<p>and his eyes fixed upon the fire.</p>\n<p>“Do you receive much company?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of</p>\n<p>Arthur’s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one</p>\n<p>else, I think.”</p>\n<p>“Do you go out much in society?”</p>\n<p>“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.”</p>",
        "<p>“That is unusual in a young girl.”</p>\n<p>“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is</p>\n<p>four-and-twenty.”</p>\n<p>“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her</p>\n<p>also.”</p>\n<p>“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”</p>\n<p>“You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”</p>",
        "<p>“How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in</p>\n<p>his hands.”</p>\n<p>“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the</p>\n<p>coronet at all injured?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it was twisted.”</p>\n<p>“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten</p>\n<p>it?”</p>",
        "<p>“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it</p>\n<p>is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose</p>\n<p>were innocent, why did he not say so?”</p>\n<p>“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His</p>\n<p>silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular</p>\n<p>points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which</p>\n<p>awoke you from your sleep?”</p>",
        "<p>“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his</p>\n<p>bedroom door.”</p>\n<p>“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as</p>\n<p>to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of</p>\n<p>these gems?”</p>\n<p>“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the</p>\n<p>hope of finding them.”</p>",
        "<p>“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has</p>\n<p>already been minutely examined.”</p>\n<p>“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that</p>\n<p>this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the</p>\n<p>police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a</p>\n<p>simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is</p>",
        "<p>involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his</p>\n<p>bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,</p>\n<p>took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,</p>\n<p>went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the</p>\n<p>thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then</p>\n<p>returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed</p>\n<p>himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is</p>",
        "<p>such a theory tenable?”</p>\n<p>“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair.</p>\n<p>“If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”</p>\n<p>“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you</p>\n<p>please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote</p>\n<p>an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”</p>\n<p>My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which</p>",
        "<p>I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply</p>\n<p>stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt</p>\n<p>of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his</p>\n<p>unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I</p>\n<p>felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was</p>\n<p>dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the</p>\n<p>whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his</p>",
        "<p>breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.</p>\n<p>Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of</p>\n<p>hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a</p>\n<p>desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway</p>\n<p>journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence</p>\n<p>of the great financier.</p>\n<p>Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a</p>",
        "<p>little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,</p>\n<p>stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the</p>\n<p>entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into</p>\n<p>a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the</p>\n<p>kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a</p>\n<p>lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at</p>\n<p>all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us</p>",
        "<p>standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the</p>\n<p>front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind</p>\n<p>into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into</p>\n<p>the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were</p>\n<p>sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.</p>\n<p>She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,</p>\n<p>which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do</p>",
        "<p>not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.</p>\n<p>Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.</p>\n<p>As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater</p>\n<p>sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the</p>\n<p>more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,</p>\n<p>with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she</p>\n<p>went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a</p>",
        "<p>sweet womanly caress.</p>\n<p>“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,</p>\n<p>dad?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”</p>\n<p>“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts</p>\n<p>are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for</p>\n<p>having acted so harshly.”</p>",
        "<p>“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”</p>\n<p>“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect</p>\n<p>him.”</p>\n<p>“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the</p>\n<p>coronet in his hand?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my</p>\n<p>word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.</p>",
        "<p>It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”</p>\n<p>“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your</p>\n<p>affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far</p>\n<p>from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London</p>\n<p>to inquire more deeply into it.”</p>\n<p>“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.</p>\n<p>“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the</p>",
        "<p>stable lane now.”</p>\n<p>“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to</p>\n<p>find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will</p>\n<p>succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin</p>\n<p>Arthur is innocent of this crime.”</p>\n<p>“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove</p>\n<p>it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his</p>",
        "<p>shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.</p>\n<p>Might I ask you a question or two?”</p>\n<p>“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”</p>\n<p>“You heard nothing yourself last night?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and</p>\n<p>I came down.”</p>\n<p>“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all</p>",
        "<p>the windows?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Were they all fastened this morning?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to</p>\n<p>your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may</p>",
        "<p>have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”</p>\n<p>“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,</p>\n<p>and that the two may have planned the robbery.”</p>\n<p>“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker</p>\n<p>impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet</p>\n<p>in his hands?”</p>\n<p>“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,</p>",
        "<p>Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met</p>\n<p>her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”</p>\n<p>“Do you know him?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His</p>\n<p>name is Francis Prosper.”</p>\n<p>“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say,</p>",
        "<p>farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, he did.”</p>\n<p>“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”</p>\n<p>Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black</p>\n<p>eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?”</p>\n<p>She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager</p>\n<p>face.</p>",
        "<p>“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably</p>\n<p>wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better</p>\n<p>take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”</p>\n<p>He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the</p>\n<p>large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he</p>\n<p>opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his</p>\n<p>powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.</p>",
        "<p>The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with</p>\n<p>a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the</p>\n<p>bureau first and looked hard at the lock.</p>\n<p>“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the</p>\n<p>lumber-room.”</p>\n<p>“Have you it here?”</p>",
        "<p>“That is it on the dressing-table.”</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.</p>\n<p>“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not</p>\n<p>wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a</p>\n<p>look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it</p>\n<p>upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,</p>\n<p>and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one</p>",
        "<p>side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three</p>\n<p>gems had been torn away.</p>\n<p>“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds</p>\n<p>to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will</p>\n<p>break it off.”</p>\n<p>The banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.</p>\n<p>“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without</p>",
        "<p>result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am</p>\n<p>exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to</p>\n<p>break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would</p>\n<p>happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a</p>\n<p>pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards</p>\n<p>of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”</p>\n<p>“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”</p>",
        "<p>“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss</p>\n<p>Holder?”</p>\n<p>“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”</p>\n<p>“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”</p>\n<p>“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck</p>\n<p>during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not</p>",
        "<p>succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I</p>\n<p>shall now continue my investigations outside.”</p>\n<p>He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any</p>\n<p>unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour</p>\n<p>or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow</p>\n<p>and his features as inscrutable as ever.</p>\n<p>“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,”</p>",
        "<p>said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”</p>\n<p>“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot tell.”</p>\n<p>The banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried.</p>\n<p>“And my son? You give me hopes?”</p>\n<p>“My opinion is in no way altered.”</p>\n<p>“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in</p>",
        "<p>my house last night?”</p>\n<p>“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning</p>\n<p>between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it</p>\n<p>clearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,</p>\n<p>provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on</p>\n<p>the sum I may draw.”</p>\n<p>“I would give my fortune to have them back.”</p>",
        "<p>“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.</p>\n<p>Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again</p>\n<p>before evening.”</p>\n<p>It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the</p>\n<p>case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even</p>\n<p>dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured</p>\n<p>to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other</p>",
        "<p>topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three</p>\n<p>when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his</p>\n<p>chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.</p>\n<p>With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and</p>\n<p>his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.</p>\n<p>“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above</p>\n<p>the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I</p>",
        "<p>fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may</p>\n<p>be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I</p>\n<p>hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from</p>\n<p>the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of</p>\n<p>bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon</p>\n<p>his expedition.</p>\n<p>I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent</p>",
        "<p>spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it</p>\n<p>down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.</p>\n<p>“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”</p>\n<p>“Where to?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I</p>\n<p>get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”</p>\n<p>“How are you getting on?”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since</p>\n<p>I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet</p>\n<p>little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.</p>\n<p>However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable</p>\n<p>clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”</p>\n<p>I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction</p>\n<p>than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even</p>",
        "<p>a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a</p>\n<p>few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that</p>\n<p>he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.</p>\n<p>I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I</p>\n<p>retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for</p>\n<p>days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his</p>\n<p>lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,</p>",
        "<p>but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a</p>\n<p>cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim</p>\n<p>as possible.</p>\n<p>“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you</p>\n<p>remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”</p>\n<p>“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if</p>\n<p>that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”</p>",
        "<p>It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change</p>\n<p>which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad</p>\n<p>and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed</p>\n<p>to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy</p>\n<p>which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,</p>\n<p>and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for</p>\n<p>him.</p>",
        "<p>“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.</p>\n<p>“Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in</p>\n<p>the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow</p>\n<p>comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>“Deserted you?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,</p>",
        "<p>and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last</p>\n<p>night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all</p>\n<p>might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say</p>\n<p>so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:</p>\n<p>“‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,</p>\n<p>and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might</p>\n<p>never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever</p>",
        "<p>again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you</p>\n<p>forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;</p>\n<p>and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless</p>\n<p>labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever</p>\n<p>your loving,</p>\n<p>“‘MARY.’</p>\n<p>“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points</p>",
        "<p>to suicide?”</p>\n<p>“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.</p>\n<p>I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”</p>\n<p>“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned</p>\n<p>something! Where are the gems?”</p>\n<p>“You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”</p>\n<p>“I would pay ten.”</p>",
        "<p>“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And</p>\n<p>there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a</p>\n<p>pen. Better make it out for £ 4000.”</p>\n<p>With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked</p>\n<p>over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three</p>\n<p>gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.</p>\n<p>With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.</p>",
        "<p>“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”</p>\n<p>The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he</p>\n<p>hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.</p>\n<p>“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes</p>\n<p>rather sternly.</p>\n<p>“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”</p>\n<p>“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble</p>",
        "<p>lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be</p>\n<p>proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”</p>\n<p>“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”</p>\n<p>“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”</p>\n<p>“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know</p>\n<p>that the truth is known.”</p>\n<p>“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview</p>",
        "<p>with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to</p>\n<p>him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very</p>\n<p>few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this</p>\n<p>morning, however, may open his lips.”</p>\n<p>“For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!”</p>\n<p>“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And</p>\n<p>let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and</p>",
        "<p>for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George</p>\n<p>Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”</p>\n<p>“My Mary? Impossible!”</p>\n<p>“It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor</p>\n<p>your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into</p>\n<p>your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a</p>\n<p>ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or</p>",
        "<p>conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his</p>\n<p>vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered</p>\n<p>herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what</p>\n<p>he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of</p>\n<p>seeing him nearly every evening.”</p>\n<p>“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker with an ashen</p>\n<p>face.</p>",
        "<p>“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your</p>\n<p>niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down</p>\n<p>and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable</p>\n<p>lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he</p>\n<p>stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold</p>\n<p>kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that</p>\n<p>she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover</p>",
        "<p>extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.</p>\n<p>She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming</p>\n<p>downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about</p>\n<p>one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was</p>\n<p>all perfectly true.</p>\n<p>“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he</p>\n<p>slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the</p>",
        "<p>middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose</p>\n<p>and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very</p>\n<p>stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your</p>\n<p>dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some</p>\n<p>clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this</p>\n<p>strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the</p>\n<p>light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious</p>",
        "<p>coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling</p>\n<p>with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,</p>\n<p>whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her</p>\n<p>stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the</p>\n<p>gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing</p>\n<p>quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.</p>\n<p>“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a</p>",
        "<p>horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she</p>\n<p>was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,</p>\n<p>and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as</p>\n<p>he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,</p>\n<p>and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the</p>\n<p>moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught</p>\n<p>him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one</p>",
        "<p>side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,</p>\n<p>your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something</p>\n<p>suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his</p>\n<p>hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had</p>\n<p>just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was</p>\n<p>endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.</p>",
        "<p>“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he</p>\n<p>felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the</p>\n<p>true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved</p>\n<p>little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous</p>\n<p>view, however, and preserved her secret.”</p>\n<p>“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,”</p>\n<p>cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his</p>",
        "<p>asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted</p>\n<p>to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How</p>\n<p>cruelly I have misjudged him!”</p>\n<p>“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very</p>\n<p>carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow</p>\n<p>which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening</p>\n<p>before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve</p>",
        "<p>impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all</p>\n<p>trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the</p>\n<p>far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,</p>\n<p>whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I</p>\n<p>could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run</p>\n<p>back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel</p>\n<p>marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I</p>",
        "<p>thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of</p>\n<p>whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I</p>\n<p>passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random</p>\n<p>tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable</p>\n<p>lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of</p>\n<p>me.</p>\n<p>“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double</p>",
        "<p>line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was</p>\n<p>at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your</p>\n<p>son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and</p>\n<p>as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it</p>\n<p>was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and</p>\n<p>found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow</p>\n<p>away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred</p>",
        "<p>yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where</p>\n<p>the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,</p>\n<p>where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not</p>\n<p>mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge</p>\n<p>of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the</p>\n<p>high road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,</p>\n<p>so there was an end to that clue.</p>",
        "<p>“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill</p>\n<p>and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see</p>\n<p>that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an</p>\n<p>instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then</p>\n<p>beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man</p>\n<p>had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed</p>\n<p>had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled</p>",
        "<p>with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength</p>\n<p>causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had</p>\n<p>returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his</p>\n<p>opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and</p>\n<p>who was it brought him the coronet?</p>\n<p>“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,</p>\n<p>whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew</p>",
        "<p>that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained</p>\n<p>your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son</p>\n<p>allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible</p>\n<p>reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent</p>\n<p>explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret</p>\n<p>was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that</p>\n<p>window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my</p>",
        "<p>conjecture became a certainty.</p>\n<p>“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for</p>\n<p>who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to</p>\n<p>you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends</p>\n<p>was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had</p>\n<p>heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It</p>\n<p>must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.</p>",
        "<p>Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still</p>\n<p>flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word</p>\n<p>without compromising his own family.</p>\n<p>“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I</p>\n<p>went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick up</p>\n<p>an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his</p>\n<p>head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,</p>",
        "<p>made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I</p>\n<p>journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the</p>\n<p>tracks.”</p>\n<p>“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Holder.</p>\n<p>“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and</p>\n<p>changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,</p>",
        "<p>for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I</p>\n<p>knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the</p>\n<p>matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.</p>\n<p>But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to</p>\n<p>bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,</p>\n<p>however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.</p>\n<p>Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give</p>",
        "<p>him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the</p>\n<p>first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he,</p>\n<p>‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get</p>\n<p>the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there</p>\n<p>would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I</p>\n<p>got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told</p>\n<p>him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock,</p>",
        "<p>after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”</p>\n<p>“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the</p>\n<p>banker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall</p>\n<p>not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed</p>\n<p>exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy</p>\n<p>to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you</p>\n<p>tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can</p>",
        "<p>inform me where she is now.”</p>\n<p>“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is</p>\n<p>wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that</p>\n<p>whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient</p>\n<p>punishment.”</p>",
        "<h3>The Adventure of the Copper Beeches</h3>\n<p>XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES</p>\n<p>“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,</p>\n<p>tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, “it is</p>\n<p>frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the</p>\n<p>keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,</p>\n<p>Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little</p>",
        "<p>records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I</p>\n<p>am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence</p>\n<p>not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in</p>\n<p>which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been</p>\n<p>trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of</p>\n<p>deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special</p>\n<p>province.”</p>",
        "<p>“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from</p>\n<p>the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”</p>\n<p>“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with</p>\n<p>the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont</p>\n<p>to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a</p>\n<p>meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and</p>\n<p>life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the</p>",
        "<p>task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect</p>\n<p>which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I</p>\n<p>remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I</p>\n<p>had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s</p>\n<p>singular character.</p>\n<p>“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his</p>",
        "<p>wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my</p>\n<p>art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.</p>\n<p>Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather</p>\n<p>than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what</p>\n<p>should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”</p>\n<p>It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast</p>\n<p>on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A</p>",
        "<p>thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the</p>\n<p>opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy</p>\n<p>yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and</p>\n<p>glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.</p>\n<p>Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously</p>\n<p>into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,</p>\n<p>having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet</p>",
        "<p>temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.</p>\n<p>“At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat</p>\n<p>puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly</p>\n<p>be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you</p>\n<p>have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not</p>\n<p>treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I</p>\n<p>endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of</p>",
        "<p>Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the</p>\n<p>twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters</p>\n<p>which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational,</p>\n<p>I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.”</p>\n<p>“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I hold to have</p>\n<p>been novel and of interest.”</p>\n<p>“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant</p>",
        "<p>public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by</p>\n<p>his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!</p>\n<p>But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of</p>\n<p>the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all</p>\n<p>enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to</p>\n<p>be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and</p>\n<p>giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I</p>",
        "<p>have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning</p>\n<p>marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter</p>\n<p>across to me.</p>\n<p>It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran</p>\n<p>thus:</p>\n<p>“DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I</p>\n<p>should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to</p>",
        "<p>me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do</p>\n<p>not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,</p>\n<p>“VIOLET HUNTER.”</p>\n<p>“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Not I.”</p>\n<p>“It is half-past ten now.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”</p>",
        "<p>“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember</p>\n<p>that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim</p>\n<p>at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this</p>\n<p>case, also.”</p>\n<p>“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for</p>\n<p>here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”</p>\n<p>As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was</p>",
        "<p>plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a</p>\n<p>plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own</p>\n<p>way to make in the world.</p>\n<p>“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my</p>\n<p>companion rose to greet her, “but I have had a very strange experience,</p>\n<p>and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask</p>\n<p>advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what</p>",
        "<p>I should do.”</p>\n<p>“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I</p>\n<p>can to serve you.”</p>\n<p>I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and</p>\n<p>speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,</p>\n<p>and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips</p>\n<p>together, to listen to her story.</p>",
        "<p>“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family of</p>\n<p>Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an</p>\n<p>appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to</p>\n<p>America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I</p>\n<p>advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last</p>\n<p>the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my</p>\n<p>wit’s end as to what I should do.</p>",
        "<p>“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called</p>\n<p>Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see</p>\n<p>whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the</p>\n<p>name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss</p>\n<p>Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are</p>\n<p>seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by</p>\n<p>one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything</p>",
        "<p>which would suit them.</p>\n<p>“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as</p>\n<p>usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout</p>\n<p>man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down</p>\n<p>in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of</p>\n<p>glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.</p>\n<p>As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to</p>",
        "<p>Miss Stoper.</p>\n<p>“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better.</p>\n<p>Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands</p>\n<p>together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking</p>\n<p>man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.</p>\n<p>“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.</p>\n<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘As governess?’</p>\n<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>\n<p>“‘And what salary do you ask?’</p>\n<p>“‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat</p>\n<p>hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How</p>\n<p>could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and</p>",
        "<p>accomplishments?’</p>\n<p>“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A</p>\n<p>little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’</p>\n<p>“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The</p>\n<p>point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a</p>\n<p>lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted</p>\n<p>for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in</p>",
        "<p>the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could any</p>\n<p>gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three</p>\n<p>figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £ 100 a year.’</p>\n<p>“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an</p>\n<p>offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing</p>\n<p>perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and</p>\n<p>took out a note.</p>",
        "<p>“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion</p>\n<p>until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white</p>\n<p>creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary</p>\n<p>beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey</p>\n<p>and their wardrobe.’</p>\n<p>“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful</p>\n<p>a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a</p>",
        "<p>great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the</p>\n<p>whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I</p>\n<p>quite committed myself.</p>\n<p>“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.</p>\n<p>“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on</p>\n<p>the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear</p>\n<p>young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’</p>\n<p>“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could</p>\n<p>see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three</p>\n<p>gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed</p>\n<p>his eyes into his head again.</p>\n<p>“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but</p>\n<p>the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.</p>",
        "<p>“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single</p>\n<p>child?’</p>\n<p>“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried.</p>\n<p>‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to</p>\n<p>obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they</p>\n<p>were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no</p>\n<p>difficulty, heh?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’</p>\n<p>“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you</p>\n<p>know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which</p>\n<p>we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’</p>\n<p>“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.</p>\n<p>“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, no.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’</p>\n<p>“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my</p>\n<p>hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.</p>\n<p>It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in</p>\n<p>this offhand fashion.</p>\n<p>“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been</p>\n<p>watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow</p>",
        "<p>pass over his face as I spoke.</p>\n<p>“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little</p>\n<p>fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’</p>\n<p>fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’</p>\n<p>“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.</p>\n<p>“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,</p>\n<p>because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In</p>",
        "<p>that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young</p>\n<p>ladies.’</p>\n<p>“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a</p>\n<p>word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance</p>\n<p>upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a</p>\n<p>handsome commission through my refusal.</p>\n<p>“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.</p>",
        "<p>“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’</p>\n<p>“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most</p>\n<p>excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly</p>\n<p>expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.</p>\n<p>Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I</p>\n<p>was shown out by the page.</p>\n<p>“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little</p>",
        "<p>enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began</p>\n<p>to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,</p>\n<p>if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most</p>\n<p>extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their</p>\n<p>eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £ 100 a year.</p>\n<p>Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by</p>\n<p>wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I</p>",
        "<p>was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I</p>\n<p>was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to</p>\n<p>the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received</p>\n<p>this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read</p>\n<p>it to you:</p>\n<p>“‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.</p>\n<p>“‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your</p>",
        "<p>address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have</p>\n<p>reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should</p>\n<p>come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We</p>\n<p>are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or £ 120 a year, so as to</p>\n<p>recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may</p>\n<p>cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond</p>\n<p>of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear</p>",
        "<p>such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to</p>\n<p>the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear</p>\n<p>daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think,</p>\n<p>fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing</p>\n<p>yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no</p>\n<p>inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,</p>\n<p>especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our</p>",
        "<p>short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this</p>\n<p>point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you</p>\n<p>for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are</p>\n<p>very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the</p>\n<p>dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,</p>\n<p>“‘JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’</p>\n<p>“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind</p>",
        "<p>is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before</p>\n<p>taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your</p>\n<p>consideration.”</p>\n<p>“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the</p>\n<p>question,” said Holmes, smiling.</p>\n<p>“But you would not advise me to refuse?”</p>\n<p>“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a</p>",
        "<p>sister of mine apply for.”</p>\n<p>“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed</p>\n<p>some opinion?”</p>\n<p>“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle</p>\n<p>seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his</p>\n<p>wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear</p>",
        "<p>she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in</p>\n<p>every way in order to prevent an outbreak?”</p>\n<p>“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most</p>\n<p>probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household</p>\n<p>for a young lady.”</p>\n<p>“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”</p>\n<p>“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes me</p>",
        "<p>uneasy. Why should they give you £ 120 a year, when they could have</p>\n<p>their pick for £ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.”</p>\n<p>“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand</p>\n<p>afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I</p>\n<p>felt that you were at the back of me.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your</p>\n<p>little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my</p>",
        "<p>way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of</p>\n<p>the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”</p>\n<p>“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”</p>\n<p>Holmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we</p>\n<p>could define it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram</p>\n<p>would bring me down to your help.”</p>\n<p>“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all</p>",
        "<p>swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my</p>\n<p>mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair</p>\n<p>to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful</p>\n<p>words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her</p>\n<p>way.</p>\n<p>“At least,” said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the</p>\n<p>stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take</p>",
        "<p>care of herself.”</p>\n<p>“And she would need to be,” said Holmes gravely. “I am much mistaken if</p>\n<p>we do not hear from her before many days are past.”</p>\n<p>It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A</p>\n<p>fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning</p>\n<p>in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human</p>\n<p>experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the</p>",
        "<p>curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something</p>\n<p>abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a</p>\n<p>philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to</p>\n<p>determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an</p>\n<p>hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the</p>\n<p>matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data!</p>\n<p>data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And</p>",
        "<p>yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should</p>\n<p>ever have accepted such a situation.</p>\n<p>The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I</p>\n<p>was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those</p>\n<p>all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I</p>\n<p>would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and</p>\n<p>find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the</p>",
        "<p>morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the</p>\n<p>message, threw it across to me.</p>\n<p>“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his</p>\n<p>chemical studies.</p>\n<p>The summons was a brief and urgent one.</p>\n<p>“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,”</p>\n<p>it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.</p>",
        "<p>“HUNTER.”</p>\n<p>“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.</p>\n<p>“I should wish to.”</p>\n<p>“Just look it up, then.”</p>\n<p>“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my</p>\n<p>Bradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11:30.”</p>\n<p>“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my</p>",
        "<p>analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the</p>\n<p>morning.”</p>\n<p>By eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old</p>\n<p>English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the</p>\n<p>way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them</p>\n<p>down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a</p>\n<p>light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across</p>",
        "<p>from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was</p>\n<p>an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.</p>\n<p>All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,</p>\n<p>the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from</p>\n<p>amid the light green of the new foliage.</p>\n<p>“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried with all the enthusiasm of</p>\n<p>a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.</p>",
        "<p>But Holmes shook his head gravely.</p>\n<p>“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind</p>\n<p>with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to</p>\n<p>my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are</p>\n<p>impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which</p>\n<p>comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with</p>\n<p>which crime may be committed there.”</p>",
        "<p>“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old</p>\n<p>homesteads?”</p>\n<p>“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,</p>\n<p>founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London</p>\n<p>do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and</p>\n<p>beautiful countryside.”</p>\n<p>“You horrify me!”</p>",
        "<p>“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do</p>\n<p>in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile</p>\n<p>that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow,</p>\n<p>does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then</p>\n<p>the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of</p>\n<p>complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime</p>\n<p>and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,</p>",
        "<p>filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the</p>\n<p>law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which</p>\n<p>may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had</p>\n<p>this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I</p>\n<p>should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country</p>\n<p>which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally</p>\n<p>threatened.”</p>",
        "<p>“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”</p>\n<p>“Quite so. She has her freedom.”</p>\n<p>“What _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?”</p>\n<p>“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover</p>\n<p>the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can</p>\n<p>only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt</p>\n<p>find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we</p>",
        "<p>shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”</p>\n<p>The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance</p>\n<p>from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She</p>\n<p>had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.</p>\n<p>“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so</p>\n<p>very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your</p>\n<p>advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”</p>",
        "<p>“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”</p>\n<p>“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to</p>\n<p>be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,</p>\n<p>though he little knew for what purpose.”</p>\n<p>“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin</p>\n<p>legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.</p>\n<p>“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no</p>",
        "<p>actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to</p>\n<p>them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my</p>\n<p>mind about them.”</p>\n<p>“What can you not understand?”</p>\n<p>“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it</p>\n<p>occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in</p>\n<p>his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully</p>",
        "<p>situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square</p>\n<p>block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp</p>\n<p>and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and</p>\n<p>on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road,</p>\n<p>which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This</p>\n<p>ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part</p>\n<p>of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately</p>",
        "<p>in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.</p>\n<p>“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was</p>\n<p>introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no</p>\n<p>truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable</p>\n<p>in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to</p>\n<p>be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more</p>\n<p>than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than</p>",
        "<p>forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been</p>\n<p>married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only</p>\n<p>child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them</p>\n<p>was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the</p>\n<p>daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that</p>\n<p>her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.</p>",
        "<p>“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in</p>\n<p>feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a</p>\n<p>nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to</p>\n<p>her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered</p>\n<p>continually from one to the other, noting every little want and</p>\n<p>forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,</p>\n<p>boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.</p>",
        "<p>And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost</p>\n<p>in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I</p>\n<p>have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the</p>\n<p>disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never</p>\n<p>met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is</p>\n<p>small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.</p>\n<p>His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage</p>",
        "<p>fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any</p>\n<p>creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and</p>\n<p>he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,</p>\n<p>little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the</p>\n<p>creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”</p>\n<p>“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to</p>\n<p>you to be relevant or not.”</p>",
        "<p>“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant</p>\n<p>thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and</p>\n<p>conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.</p>\n<p>Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled</p>\n<p>hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have</p>\n<p>been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to</p>\n<p>take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a</p>",
        "<p>sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a</p>\n<p>most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the</p>\n<p>nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of</p>\n<p>the building.</p>\n<p>“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very</p>\n<p>quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and</p>\n<p>whispered something to her husband.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you,</p>\n<p>Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.</p>\n<p>I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your</p>\n<p>appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become</p>\n<p>you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you</p>\n<p>would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’</p>\n<p>“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of</p>",
        "<p>blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore</p>\n<p>unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a</p>\n<p>better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle</p>\n<p>expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated</p>\n<p>in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which</p>\n<p>is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,</p>\n<p>with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been</p>",
        "<p>placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In</p>\n<p>this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on</p>\n<p>the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest</p>\n<p>stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he</p>\n<p>was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who</p>\n<p>has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with</p>\n<p>her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an</p>",
        "<p>hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence</p>\n<p>the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to</p>\n<p>little Edward in the nursery.</p>\n<p>“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly</p>\n<p>similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the</p>\n<p>window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which</p>\n<p>my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.</p>",
        "<p>Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little</p>\n<p>sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me</p>\n<p>to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the</p>\n<p>heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he</p>\n<p>ordered me to cease and to change my dress.</p>\n<p>“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what</p>\n<p>the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They</p>",
        "<p>were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the</p>\n<p>window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going</p>\n<p>on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon</p>\n<p>devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought</p>\n<p>seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On</p>\n<p>the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief</p>\n<p>up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that</p>",
        "<p>there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was</p>\n<p>nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,</p>\n<p>however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton</p>\n<p>Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in</p>\n<p>my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually</p>\n<p>people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which</p>\n<p>bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my</p>",
        "<p>handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon</p>\n<p>me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced</p>\n<p>that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what</p>\n<p>was behind me. She rose at once.</p>\n<p>“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road</p>\n<p>there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’</p>\n<p>“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.</p>",
        "<p>“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’</p>\n<p>“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to</p>\n<p>go away.’</p>\n<p>“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’</p>\n<p>“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round</p>\n<p>and wave him away like that.’</p>\n<p>“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down</p>",
        "<p>the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again</p>\n<p>in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the</p>\n<p>road.”</p>\n<p>“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most</p>\n<p>interesting one.”</p>\n<p>“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to</p>\n<p>be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On</p>",
        "<p>the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took</p>\n<p>me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we</p>\n<p>approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as</p>\n<p>of a large animal moving about.</p>\n<p>“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two</p>\n<p>planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’</p>\n<p>“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague</p>",
        "<p>figure huddled up in the darkness.</p>\n<p>“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I</p>\n<p>had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really</p>\n<p>old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We</p>\n<p>feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as</p>\n<p>keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the</p>\n<p>trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you</p>",
        "<p>ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s</p>\n<p>as much as your life is worth.’</p>\n<p>“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look</p>\n<p>out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a</p>\n<p>beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was</p>\n<p>silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the</p>\n<p>peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was</p>",
        "<p>moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the</p>\n<p>moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,</p>\n<p>tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting</p>\n<p>bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow</p>\n<p>upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart</p>\n<p>which I do not think that any burglar could have done.</p>\n<p>“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you</p>",
        "<p>know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at</p>\n<p>the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I</p>\n<p>began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by</p>\n<p>rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in</p>\n<p>the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I</p>\n<p>had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack</p>\n<p>away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.</p>",
        "<p>It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I</p>\n<p>took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key</p>\n<p>fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one</p>\n<p>thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It</p>\n<p>was my coil of hair.</p>\n<p>“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and</p>\n<p>the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded</p>",
        "<p>itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With</p>\n<p>trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew</p>\n<p>from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I</p>\n<p>assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle</p>\n<p>as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned</p>\n<p>the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the</p>\n<p>Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a</p>",
        "<p>drawer which they had locked.</p>\n<p>“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I</p>\n<p>soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was</p>\n<p>one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door</p>\n<p>which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into</p>\n<p>this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I</p>\n<p>ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,</p>",
        "<p>his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very</p>\n<p>different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His</p>\n<p>cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins</p>\n<p>stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried</p>\n<p>past me without a word or a look.</p>\n<p>“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the</p>\n<p>grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could</p>",
        "<p>see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a</p>\n<p>row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered</p>\n<p>up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,</p>\n<p>glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as</p>\n<p>merry and jovial as ever.</p>\n<p>“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a</p>\n<p>word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’</p>",
        "<p>“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem</p>\n<p>to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the</p>\n<p>shutters up.’</p>\n<p>“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my</p>\n<p>remark.</p>\n<p>“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room</p>\n<p>up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.</p>",
        "<p>Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke</p>\n<p>in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at</p>\n<p>me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.</p>\n<p>“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was</p>\n<p>something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all</p>\n<p>on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my</p>\n<p>share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good</p>",
        "<p>might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s</p>\n<p>instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.</p>\n<p>At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any</p>\n<p>chance to pass the forbidden door.</p>\n<p>“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,</p>\n<p>besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in</p>\n<p>these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen</p>",
        "<p>bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and</p>\n<p>yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was</p>\n<p>the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.</p>\n<p>Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with</p>\n<p>them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently</p>\n<p>in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.</p>\n<p>“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,</p>",
        "<p>which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner</p>\n<p>were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.</p>\n<p>They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows</p>\n<p>in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening</p>\n<p>light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and</p>\n<p>across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an</p>\n<p>iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at</p>",
        "<p>the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the</p>\n<p>key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the</p>\n<p>shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from</p>\n<p>beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a</p>\n<p>skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage</p>\n<p>gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I</p>\n<p>suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass</p>",
        "<p>backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone</p>\n<p>out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the</p>\n<p>sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I</p>\n<p>turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me</p>\n<p>clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through</p>\n<p>the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting</p>\n<p>outside.</p>",
        "<p>“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be</p>\n<p>when I saw the door open.’</p>\n<p>“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.</p>\n<p>“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how</p>\n<p>caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my</p>\n<p>dear young lady?’</p>\n<p>“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was</p>",
        "<p>keenly on my guard against him.</p>\n<p>“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it</p>\n<p>is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran</p>\n<p>out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’</p>\n<p>“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.</p>\n<p>“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.</p>\n<p>“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘I am sure that I do not know.’</p>\n<p>“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He</p>\n<p>was still smiling in the most amiable manner.</p>\n<p>“‘I am sure if I had known—’</p>\n<p>“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that</p>\n<p>threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of</p>\n<p>rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you</p>",
        "<p>to the mastiff.’</p>\n<p>“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I</p>\n<p>must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I</p>\n<p>found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,</p>\n<p>Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was</p>\n<p>frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,</p>\n<p>even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring</p>",
        "<p>you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,</p>\n<p>but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon</p>\n<p>made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down</p>\n<p>to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then</p>\n<p>returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind</p>\n<p>as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered</p>\n<p>that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that</p>",
        "<p>evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had</p>\n<p>any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him</p>\n<p>free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at</p>\n<p>the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come</p>\n<p>into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,</p>\n<p>for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all</p>\n<p>the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you</p>",
        "<p>all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could</p>\n<p>tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”</p>\n<p>Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My</p>\n<p>friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his</p>\n<p>pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.</p>\n<p>“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing</p>",
        "<p>with him.”</p>\n<p>“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, the wine-cellar.”</p>\n<p>“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave</p>\n<p>and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one</p>",
        "<p>more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite</p>\n<p>exceptional woman.”</p>\n<p>“I will try. What is it?”</p>\n<p>“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I.</p>\n<p>The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be</p>\n<p>incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If</p>\n<p>you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the</p>",
        "<p>key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”</p>\n<p>“I will do it.”</p>\n<p>“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course</p>\n<p>there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to</p>\n<p>personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.</p>\n<p>That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is</p>\n<p>the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to</p>",
        "<p>have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in</p>\n<p>height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,</p>\n<p>very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of</p>\n<p>course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came</p>\n<p>upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of</p>\n<p>hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress</p>\n<p>and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he</p>",
        "<p>saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was</p>\n<p>perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog</p>\n<p>is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate</p>\n<p>with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case</p>\n<p>is the disposition of the child.”</p>\n<p>“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.</p>\n<p>“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as</p>",
        "<p>to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see</p>\n<p>that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first</p>\n<p>real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.</p>\n<p>This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s</p>\n<p>sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should</p>\n<p>suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in</p>\n<p>their power.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A</p>\n<p>thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit</p>\n<p>it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor</p>\n<p>creature.”</p>\n<p>“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We</p>\n<p>can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you,</p>\n<p>and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”</p>",
        "<p>We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the</p>\n<p>Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The</p>\n<p>group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in</p>\n<p>the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even</p>\n<p>had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.</p>\n<p>“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.</p>\n<p>A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the</p>\n<p>kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.</p>\n<p>Rucastle’s.”</p>\n<p>“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead</p>\n<p>the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”</p>\n<p>We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,</p>\n<p>and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had</p>",
        "<p>described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he</p>\n<p>tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came</p>\n<p>from within, and at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.</p>\n<p>“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter,</p>\n<p>that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to</p>\n<p>it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”</p>\n<p>It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.</p>",
        "<p>Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture</p>\n<p>save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The</p>\n<p>skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.</p>\n<p>“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has</p>\n<p>guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”</p>\n<p>“But how?”</p>\n<p>“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung</p>",
        "<p>himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a</p>\n<p>long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”</p>\n<p>“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there</p>\n<p>when the Rucastles went away.”</p>\n<p>“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and</p>\n<p>dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he</p>\n<p>whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be</p>",
        "<p>as well for you to have your pistol ready.”</p>\n<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the</p>\n<p>door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his</p>\n<p>hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of</p>\n<p>him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.</p>\n<p>“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”</p>\n<p>The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.</p>",
        "<p>“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and</p>\n<p>thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve</p>\n<p>you!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.</p>\n<p>“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.</p>\n<p>“I have my revolver,” said I.</p>\n<p>“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the</p>\n<p>stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the</p>",
        "<p>baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying</p>\n<p>sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red</p>\n<p>face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.</p>\n<p>“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for</p>\n<p>two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”</p>\n<p>Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller</p>\n<p>hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle</p>",
        "<p>buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the</p>\n<p>ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its</p>\n<p>keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With</p>\n<p>much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly</p>\n<p>mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and</p>\n<p>having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I</p>\n<p>did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him</p>",
        "<p>when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.</p>\n<p>“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up</p>\n<p>to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were</p>\n<p>planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”</p>\n<p>“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller</p>\n<p>knows more about this matter than anyone else.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”</p>\n<p>“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points</p>\n<p>on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”</p>\n<p>“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so</p>\n<p>before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s</p>\n<p>police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one</p>\n<p>that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.</p>",
        "<p>“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her</p>\n<p>father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,</p>\n<p>but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler</p>\n<p>at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of</p>\n<p>her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she</p>\n<p>never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s</p>\n<p>hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a</p>",
        "<p>husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give</p>\n<p>him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her</p>\n<p>to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her</p>\n<p>money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got</p>\n<p>brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better</p>\n<p>at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but</p>\n<p>that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as</p>",
        "<p>true as man could be.”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell</p>\n<p>us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that</p>\n<p>remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of</p>\n<p>imprisonment?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>\n<p>“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the</p>",
        "<p>disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”</p>\n<p>“That was it, sir.”</p>\n<p>“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,</p>\n<p>blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,</p>\n<p>metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the</p>\n<p>same as his.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Toller serenely.</p>\n<p>“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of</p>\n<p>drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master</p>\n<p>had gone out.”</p>\n<p>“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”</p>\n<p>“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you</p>\n<p>have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes</p>",
        "<p>the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had</p>\n<p>best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our</p>\n<p>_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.”</p>\n<p>And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper</p>\n<p>beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a</p>\n<p>broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.</p>\n<p>They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of</p>",
        "<p>Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr.</p>\n<p>Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in</p>\n<p>Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a</p>\n<p>government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet</p>\n<p>Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no</p>\n<p>further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of</p>\n<p>one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at</p>",
        "<p>Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.</p>"
