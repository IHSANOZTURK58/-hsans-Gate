        "<h3>Mowgli’s Brothers</h3>\n<p>Now Rann the Kite brings home the night That Mang</p>\n<p>the Bat sets free-- The herds are shut in byre</p>\n<p>and hut For loosed till dawn are we. This is</p>\n<p>the hour of pride and power, Talon and tush and</p>\n<p>claw. Oh, hear the call!--Good hunting all That keep the</p>\n<p>Jungle Law! _Night-Song in the Jungle_ It was seven o’clock</p>\n<p>of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when</p>",
        "<p>Father Wolf woke up from his day’s rest, scratched himself,</p>\n<p>yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other</p>\n<p>to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips.</p>\n<p>Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across</p>\n<p>her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into</p>\n<p>the mouth of the cave where they all lived. “Augrh!”</p>\n<p>said Father Wolf. “It is time to hunt again.” He</p>",
        "<p>was going to spring down hill when a little shadow</p>\n<p>with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: “Good</p>\n<p>luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves. And</p>\n<p>good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children</p>\n<p>that they may never forget the hungry in this world.”</p>\n<p>It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India</p>\n<p>despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling</p>",
        "<p>tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the</p>\n<p>village rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because</p>\n<p>Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt</p>\n<p>to go mad, and then he forgets that he was</p>\n<p>ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting</p>\n<p>everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides</p>\n<p>when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most</p>",
        "<p>disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature. We call</p>\n<p>it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the madness--and run. “Enter,</p>\n<p>then, and look,” said Father Wolf stiffly, “but there is</p>\n<p>no food here.” “For a wolf, no,” said Tabaqui, “but</p>\n<p>for so mean a person as myself a dry bone</p>\n<p>is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the</p>\n<p>jackal people], to pick and choose?” He scuttled to the</p>",
        "<p>back of the cave, where he found the bone of</p>\n<p>a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking</p>\n<p>the end merrily. “All thanks for this good meal,” he</p>\n<p>said, licking his lips. “How beautiful are the noble children!</p>\n<p>How large are their eyes! And so young too! Indeed,</p>\n<p>indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings</p>\n<p>are men from the beginning.” Now, Tabaqui knew as well</p>",
        "<p>as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as</p>\n<p>to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to</p>\n<p>see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable. Tabaqui sat still,</p>\n<p>rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then</p>\n<p>he said spitefully: “Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted</p>\n<p>his hunting grounds. He will hunt among these hills for</p>\n<p>the next moon, so he has told me.” Shere Khan</p>",
        "<p>was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty</p>\n<p>miles away. “He has no right!” Father Wolf began angrily--“By</p>\n<p>the Law of the Jungle he has no right to</p>\n<p>change his quarters without due warning. He will frighten every</p>\n<p>head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to</p>\n<p>kill for two, these days.” “His mother did not call</p>\n<p>him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,” said Mother Wolf</p>",
        "<p>quietly. “He has been lame in one foot from his</p>\n<p>birth. That is why he has only killed cattle. Now</p>\n<p>the villagers of the Waingunga are angry with him, and</p>\n<p>he has come here to make our villagers angry. They</p>\n<p>will scour the jungle for him when he is far</p>\n<p>away, and we and our children must run when the</p>\n<p>grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very grateful to</p>",
        "<p>Shere Khan!” “Shall I tell him of your gratitude?” said</p>\n<p>Tabaqui. “Out!” snapped Father Wolf. “Out and hunt with thy</p>\n<p>master. Thou hast done harm enough for one night.” “I</p>\n<p>go,” said Tabaqui quietly. “Ye can hear Shere Khan below</p>\n<p>in the thickets. I might have saved myself the message.”</p>\n<p>Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran</p>\n<p>down to a little river he heard the dry, angry,</p>",
        "<p>snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing</p>\n<p>and does not care if all the jungle knows it.</p>\n<p>“The fool!” said Father Wolf. “To begin a night’s work</p>\n<p>with that noise! Does he think that our buck are</p>\n<p>like his fat Waingunga bullocks?” “H’sh. It is neither bullock</p>\n<p>nor buck he hunts to-night,” said Mother Wolf. “It is</p>\n<p>Man.” The whine had changed to a sort of humming</p>",
        "<p>purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the</p>\n<p>compass. It was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies</p>\n<p>sleeping in the open, and makes them run sometimes into</p>\n<p>the very mouth of the tiger. “Man!” said Father Wolf,</p>\n<p>showing all his white teeth. “Faugh! Are there not enough</p>\n<p>beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat</p>\n<p>Man, and on our ground too!” The Law of the</p>",
        "<p>Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every</p>\n<p>beast to eat Man except when he is killing to</p>\n<p>show his children how to kill, and then he must</p>\n<p>hunt outside the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe.</p>\n<p>The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner</p>\n<p>or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with</p>\n<p>guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets</p>",
        "<p>and torches. Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason</p>\n<p>the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the</p>\n<p>weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it</p>\n<p>is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is</p>\n<p>true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth. The purr</p>\n<p>grew louder, and ended in the full-throated “Aaarh!” of the</p>\n<p>tiger’s charge. Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere</p>",
        "<p>Khan. “He has missed,” said Mother Wolf. “What is it?”</p>\n<p>Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere</p>\n<p>Khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in</p>\n<p>the scrub. “The fool has had no more sense than</p>\n<p>to jump at a woodcutter’s campfire, and has burned his</p>\n<p>feet,” said Father Wolf with a grunt. “Tabaqui is with</p>\n<p>him.” “Something is coming uphill,” said Mother Wolf, twitching one</p>",
        "<p>ear. “Get ready.” The bushes rustled a little in the</p>\n<p>thicket, and Father Wolf dropped with his haunches under him,</p>\n<p>ready for his leap. Then, if you had been watching,</p>\n<p>you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the</p>\n<p>world--the wolf checked in mid-spring. He made his bound before</p>\n<p>he saw what it was he was jumping at, and</p>\n<p>then he tried to stop himself. The result was that</p>",
        "<p>he shot up straight into the air for four or</p>\n<p>five feet, landing almost where he left ground. “Man!” he</p>\n<p>snapped. “A man’s cub. Look!” Directly in front of him,</p>\n<p>holding on by a low branch, stood a naked brown</p>\n<p>baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a</p>\n<p>little atom as ever came to a wolf’s cave at</p>\n<p>night. He looked up into Father Wolf’s face, and laughed.</p>",
        "<p>“Is that a man’s cub?” said Mother Wolf. “I have</p>\n<p>never seen one. Bring it here.” A Wolf accustomed to</p>\n<p>moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg</p>\n<p>without breaking it, and though Father Wolf’s jaws closed right</p>\n<p>on the child’s back not a tooth even scratched the</p>\n<p>skin as he laid it down among the cubs. “How</p>\n<p>little! How naked, and--how bold!” said Mother Wolf softly. The</p>",
        "<p>baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get</p>\n<p>close to the warm hide. “Ahai! He is taking his</p>\n<p>meal with the others. And so this is a man’s</p>\n<p>cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast</p>\n<p>of a man’s cub among her children?” “I have heard</p>\n<p>now and again of such a thing, but never in</p>\n<p>our Pack or in my time,” said Father Wolf. “He</p>",
        "<p>is altogether without hair, and I could kill him with</p>\n<p>a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up</p>\n<p>and is not afraid.” The moonlight was blocked out of</p>\n<p>the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan’s great square</p>\n<p>head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui, behind</p>\n<p>him, was squeaking: “My lord, my lord, it went in</p>\n<p>here!” “Shere Khan does us great honor,” said Father Wolf,</p>",
        "<p>but his eyes were very angry. “What does Shere Khan</p>\n<p>need?” “My quarry. A man’s cub went this way,” said</p>\n<p>Shere Khan. “Its parents have run off. Give it to</p>\n<p>me.” Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter’s campfire, as</p>\n<p>Father Wolf had said, and was furious from the pain</p>\n<p>of his burned feet. But Father Wolf knew that the</p>\n<p>mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger</p>",
        "<p>to come in by. Even where he was, Shere Khan’s</p>\n<p>shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of room, as</p>\n<p>a man’s would be if he tried to fight in</p>\n<p>a barrel. “The Wolves are a free people,” said Father</p>\n<p>Wolf. “They take orders from the Head of the Pack,</p>\n<p>and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man’s cub is</p>\n<p>ours--to kill if we choose.” “Ye choose and ye do</p>",
        "<p>not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the</p>\n<p>bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into</p>\n<p>your dog’s den for my fair dues? It is I,</p>\n<p>Shere Khan, who speak!” The tiger’s roar filled the cave</p>\n<p>with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself clear of the cubs</p>\n<p>and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in</p>\n<p>the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan. “And</p>",
        "<p>it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers. The man’s</p>\n<p>cub is mine, Lungri--mine to me! He shall not be</p>\n<p>killed. He shall live to run with the Pack and</p>\n<p>to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look</p>\n<p>you, hunter of little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee! Now</p>\n<p>get hence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (I</p>\n<p>eat no starved cattle), back thou goest to thy mother,</p>",
        "<p>burned beast of the jungle, lamer than ever thou camest</p>\n<p>into the world! Go!” Father Wolf looked on amazed. He</p>\n<p>had almost forgotten the days when he won Mother Wolf</p>\n<p>in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran</p>\n<p>in the Pack and was not called The Demon for</p>\n<p>compliment’s sake. Shere Khan might have faced Father Wolf, but</p>\n<p>he could not stand up against Mother Wolf, for he</p>",
        "<p>knew that where he was she had all the advantage</p>\n<p>of the ground, and would fight to the death. So</p>\n<p>he backed out of the cave mouth growling, and when</p>\n<p>he was clear he shouted: “Each dog barks in his</p>\n<p>own yard! We will see what the Pack will say</p>\n<p>to this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and</p>\n<p>to my teeth he will come in the end, O</p>",
        "<p>bush-tailed thieves!” Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the</p>\n<p>cubs, and Father Wolf said to her gravely: “Shere Khan</p>\n<p>speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to</p>\n<p>the Pack. Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?” “Keep him!”</p>\n<p>she gasped. “He came naked, by night, alone and very</p>\n<p>hungry; yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed</p>\n<p>one of my babes to one side already. And that</p>",
        "<p>lame butcher would have killed him and would have run</p>\n<p>off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through</p>\n<p>all our lairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will</p>\n<p>keep him. Lie still, little frog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli</p>\n<p>the Frog I will call thee--the time will come when</p>\n<p>thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.”</p>\n<p>“But what will our Pack say?” said Father Wolf. The</p>",
        "<p>Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any</p>\n<p>wolf may, when he marries, withdraw from the Pack he</p>\n<p>belongs to. But as soon as his cubs are old</p>\n<p>enough to stand on their feet he must bring them</p>\n<p>to the Pack Council, which is generally held once a</p>\n<p>month at full moon, in order that the other wolves</p>\n<p>may identify them. After that inspection the cubs are free</p>",
        "<p>to run where they please, and until they have killed</p>\n<p>their first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown</p>\n<p>wolf of the Pack kills one of them. The punishment</p>\n<p>is death where the murderer can be found; and if</p>\n<p>you think for a minute you will see that this</p>\n<p>must be so. Father Wolf waited till his cubs could</p>\n<p>run a little, and then on the night of the</p>",
        "<p>Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to</p>\n<p>the Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where</p>\n<p>a hundred wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone</p>\n<p>Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning,</p>\n<p>lay out at full length on his rock, and below</p>\n<p>him sat forty or more wolves of every size and</p>\n<p>color, from badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone</p>",
        "<p>to young black three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone</p>\n<p>Wolf had led them for a year now. He had</p>\n<p>fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and</p>\n<p>once he had been beaten and left for dead; so</p>\n<p>he knew the manners and customs of men. There was</p>\n<p>very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over</p>\n<p>each other in the center of the circle where their</p>",
        "<p>mothers and fathers sat, and now and again a senior</p>\n<p>wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look at</p>\n<p>him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into</p>\n<p>the moonlight to be sure that he had not been</p>\n<p>overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: “Ye know the</p>\n<p>Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!” And the</p>",
        "<p>anxious mothers would take up the call: “Look--look well, O</p>\n<p>Wolves!” At last--and Mother Wolf’s neck bristles lifted as the</p>\n<p>time came--Father Wolf pushed “Mowgli the Frog,” as they called</p>\n<p>him, into the center, where he sat laughing and playing</p>\n<p>with some pebbles that glistened in the moonlight. Akela never</p>\n<p>raised his head from his paws, but went on with</p>\n<p>the monotonous cry: “Look well!” A muffled roar came up</p>",
        "<p>from behind the rocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: “The</p>\n<p>cub is mine. Give him to me. What have the</p>\n<p>Free People to do with a man’s cub?” Akela never</p>\n<p>even twitched his ears. All he said was: “Look well,</p>\n<p>O Wolves! What have the Free People to do with</p>\n<p>the orders of any save the Free People? Look well!”</p>\n<p>There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young</p>",
        "<p>wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question</p>\n<p>to Akela: “What have the Free People to do with</p>\n<p>a man’s cub?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays</p>\n<p>down that if there is any dispute as to the</p>\n<p>right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack,</p>\n<p>he must be spoken for by at least two members</p>\n<p>of the Pack who are not his father and mother.</p>",
        "<p>“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free</p>\n<p>People who speaks?” There was no answer and Mother Wolf</p>\n<p>got ready for what she knew would be her last</p>\n<p>fight, if things came to fighting. Then the only other</p>\n<p>creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo, the sleepy</p>\n<p>brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of</p>\n<p>the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where</p>",
        "<p>he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and</p>\n<p>honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted. “The man’s cub--the</p>\n<p>man’s cub?” he said. “I speak for the man’s cub.</p>\n<p>There is no harm in a man’s cub. I have</p>\n<p>no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let</p>\n<p>him run with the Pack, and be entered with the</p>\n<p>others. I myself will teach him.” “We need yet another,”</p>",
        "<p>said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher</p>\n<p>for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?” A black</p>\n<p>shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the</p>\n<p>Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther</p>\n<p>markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of</p>\n<p>watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross</p>\n<p>his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as</p>",
        "<p>bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the</p>\n<p>wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as</p>\n<p>wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer</p>\n<p>than down. “O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he</p>\n<p>purred, “I have no right in your assembly, but the</p>\n<p>Law of the Jungle says that if there is a</p>\n<p>doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to</p>",
        "<p>a new cub, the life of that cub may be</p>\n<p>bought at a price. And the Law does not say</p>\n<p>who may or may not pay that price. Am I</p>\n<p>right?” “Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always</p>\n<p>hungry. “Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for</p>\n<p>a price. It is the Law.” “Knowing that I have</p>\n<p>no right to speak here, I ask your leave.” “Speak</p>",
        "<p>then,” cried twenty voices. “To kill a naked cub is</p>\n<p>shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when</p>\n<p>he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now</p>\n<p>to Baloo’s word I will add one bull, and a</p>\n<p>fat one, newly killed, not half a mile from here,</p>\n<p>if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the</p>\n<p>Law. Is it difficult?” There was a clamor of scores</p>",
        "<p>of voices, saying: “What matter? He will die in the</p>\n<p>winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm</p>\n<p>can a naked frog do us? Let him run with</p>\n<p>the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be</p>\n<p>accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well--look</p>\n<p>well, O Wolves!” Mowgli was still deeply interested in the</p>\n<p>pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came</p>",
        "<p>and looked at him one by one. At last they</p>\n<p>all went down the hill for the dead bull, and</p>\n<p>only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli’s own wolves were left.</p>\n<p>Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was</p>\n<p>very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to</p>\n<p>him. “Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for</p>\n<p>the time will come when this naked thing will make</p>",
        "<p>thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of</p>\n<p>man.” “It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their</p>\n<p>cubs are very wise. He may be a help in</p>\n<p>time.” “Truly, a help in time of need; for none</p>\n<p>can hope to lead the Pack forever,” said Bagheera. Akela</p>\n<p>said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes</p>\n<p>to every leader of every pack when his strength goes</p>",
        "<p>from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at</p>\n<p>last he is killed by the wolves and a new</p>\n<p>leader comes up--to be killed in his turn. “Take him</p>\n<p>away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as</p>\n<p>befits one of the Free People.” And that is how</p>\n<p>Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the</p>\n<p>price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word. Now</p>",
        "<p>you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole</p>\n<p>years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that</p>\n<p>Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written</p>\n<p>out it would fill ever so many books. He grew</p>\n<p>up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown</p>\n<p>wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf</p>\n<p>taught him his business, and the meaning of things in</p>",
        "<p>the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath</p>\n<p>of the warm night air, every note of the owls</p>\n<p>above his head, every scratch of a bat’s claws as</p>\n<p>it roosted for a while in a tree, and every</p>\n<p>splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant</p>\n<p>just as much to him as the work of his</p>\n<p>office means to a business man. When he was not</p>",
        "<p>learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and</p>\n<p>ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty</p>\n<p>or hot he swam in the forest pools; and when</p>\n<p>he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts</p>\n<p>were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he</p>\n<p>climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how</p>\n<p>to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and</p>",
        "<p>call, “Come along, Little Brother,” and at first Mowgli would</p>\n<p>cling like the sloth, but afterward he would fling himself</p>\n<p>through the branches almost as boldly as the gray ape.</p>\n<p>He took his place at the Council Rock, too, when</p>\n<p>the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he</p>\n<p>stared hard at any wolf, the wolf would be forced</p>\n<p>to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare</p>",
        "<p>for fun. At other times he would pick the long</p>\n<p>thorns out of the pads of his friends, for wolves</p>\n<p>suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats. He</p>\n<p>would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by</p>\n<p>night, and look very curiously at the villagers in their</p>\n<p>huts, but he had a mistrust of men because Bagheera</p>\n<p>showed him a square box with a drop gate so</p>",
        "<p>cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into</p>\n<p>it, and told him that it was a trap. He</p>\n<p>loved better than anything else to go with Bagheera into</p>\n<p>the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all</p>\n<p>through the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera</p>\n<p>did his killing. Bagheera killed right and left as he</p>\n<p>felt hungry, and so did Mowgli--with one exception. As soon</p>",
        "<p>as he was old enough to understand things, Bagheera told</p>\n<p>him that he must never touch cattle because he had</p>\n<p>been bought into the Pack at the price of a</p>\n<p>bull’s life. “All the jungle is thine,” said Bagheera, “and</p>\n<p>thou canst kill everything that thou art strong enough to</p>\n<p>kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought</p>\n<p>thee thou must never kill or eat any cattle young</p>",
        "<p>or old. That is the Law of the Jungle.” Mowgli</p>\n<p>obeyed faithfully. And he grew and grew strong as a</p>\n<p>boy must grow who does not know that he is</p>\n<p>learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world</p>\n<p>to think of except things to eat. Mother Wolf told</p>\n<p>him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a</p>\n<p>creature to be trusted, and that some day he must</p>",
        "<p>kill Shere Khan. But though a young wolf would have</p>\n<p>remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot it because he</p>\n<p>was only a boy--though he would have called himself a</p>\n<p>wolf if he had been able to speak in any</p>\n<p>human tongue. Shere Khan was always crossing his path in</p>\n<p>the jungle, for as Akela grew older and feebler the</p>\n<p>lame tiger had come to be great friends with the</p>",
        "<p>younger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps,</p>\n<p>a thing Akela would never have allowed if he had</p>\n<p>dared to push his authority to the proper bounds. Then</p>\n<p>Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine</p>\n<p>young hunters were content to be led by a dying</p>\n<p>wolf and a man’s cub. “They tell me,” Shere Khan</p>\n<p>would say, “that at Council ye dare not look him</p>",
        "<p>between the eyes.” And the young wolves would growl and</p>\n<p>bristle. Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something</p>\n<p>of this, and once or twice he told Mowgli in</p>\n<p>so many words that Shere Khan would kill him some</p>\n<p>day. Mowgli would laugh and answer: “I have the Pack</p>\n<p>and I have thee; and Baloo, though he is so</p>\n<p>lazy, might strike a blow or two for my sake.</p>",
        "<p>Why should I be afraid?” It was one very warm</p>\n<p>day that a new notion came to Bagheera--born of something</p>\n<p>that he had heard. Perhaps Ikki the Porcupine had told</p>\n<p>him; but he said to Mowgli when they were deep</p>\n<p>in the jungle, as the boy lay with his head</p>\n<p>on Bagheera’s beautiful black skin, “Little Brother, how often have</p>\n<p>I told thee that Shere Khan is thy enemy?” “As</p>",
        "<p>many times as there are nuts on that palm,” said</p>\n<p>Mowgli, who, naturally, could not count. “What of it? I</p>\n<p>am sleepy, Bagheera, and Shere Khan is all long tail</p>\n<p>and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock.” “But this is no</p>\n<p>time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the</p>\n<p>Pack know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know.</p>\n<p>Tabaqui has told thee too.” “Ho! ho!” said Mowgli. “Tabaqui</p>",
        "<p>came to me not long ago with some rude talk</p>\n<p>that I was a naked man’s cub and not fit</p>\n<p>to dig pig-nuts. But I caught Tabaqui by the tail</p>\n<p>and swung him twice against a palm-tree to teach him</p>\n<p>better manners.” “That was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a</p>\n<p>mischief-maker, he would have told thee of something that concerned</p>\n<p>thee closely. Open those eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare</p>",
        "<p>not kill thee in the jungle. But remember, Akela is</p>\n<p>very old, and soon the day comes when he cannot</p>\n<p>kill his buck, and then he will be leader no</p>\n<p>more. Many of the wolves that looked thee over when</p>\n<p>thou wast brought to the Council first are old too,</p>\n<p>and the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught</p>\n<p>them, that a man-cub has no place with the Pack.</p>",
        "<p>In a little time thou wilt be a man.” “And</p>\n<p>what is a man that he should not run with</p>\n<p>his brothers?” said Mowgli. “I was born in the jungle.</p>\n<p>I have obeyed the Law of the Jungle, and there</p>\n<p>is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have</p>\n<p>not pulled a thorn. Surely they are my brothers!” Bagheera</p>\n<p>stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes.</p>",
        "<p>“Little Brother,” said he, “feel under my jaw.” Mowgli put</p>\n<p>up his strong brown hand, and just under Bagheera’s silky</p>\n<p>chin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by</p>\n<p>the glossy hair, he came upon a little bald spot.</p>\n<p>“There is no one in the jungle that knows that</p>\n<p>I, Bagheera, carry that mark--the mark of the collar; and</p>\n<p>yet, Little Brother, I was born among men, and it</p>",
        "<p>was among men that my mother died--in the cages of</p>\n<p>the king’s palace at Oodeypore. It was because of this</p>\n<p>that I paid the price for thee at the Council</p>\n<p>when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too</p>\n<p>was born among men. I had never seen the jungle.</p>\n<p>They fed me behind bars from an iron pan till</p>\n<p>one night I felt that I was Bagheera--the Panther--and no</p>",
        "<p>man’s plaything, and I broke the silly lock with one</p>\n<p>blow of my paw and came away. And because I</p>\n<p>had learned the ways of men, I became more terrible</p>\n<p>in the jungle than Shere Khan. Is it not so?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mowgli, “all the jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, thou art a man’s cub,” said the Black Panther</p>\n<p>very tenderly. “And even as I returned to my jungle,</p>",
        "<p>so thou must go back to men at last--to the</p>\n<p>men who are thy brothers--if thou art not killed in</p>\n<p>the Council.” “But why--but why should any wish to kill</p>\n<p>me?” said Mowgli. “Look at me,” said Bagheera. And Mowgli</p>\n<p>looked at him steadily between the eyes. The big panther</p>\n<p>turned his head away in half a minute. “That is</p>\n<p>why,” he said, shifting his paw on the leaves. “Not</p>",
        "<p>even I can look thee between the eyes, and I</p>\n<p>was born among men, and I love thee, Little Brother.</p>\n<p>The others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet</p>\n<p>thine; because thou art wise; because thou hast pulled out</p>\n<p>thorns from their feet--because thou art a man.” “I did</p>\n<p>not know these things,” said Mowgli sullenly, and he frowned</p>\n<p>under his heavy black eyebrows. “What is the Law of</p>",
        "<p>the Jungle? Strike first and then give tongue. By thy</p>\n<p>very carelessness they know that thou art a man. But</p>\n<p>be wise. It is in my heart that when Akela</p>\n<p>misses his next kill--and at each hunt it costs him</p>\n<p>more to pin the buck--the Pack will turn against him</p>\n<p>and against thee. They will hold a jungle Council at</p>\n<p>the Rock, and then--and then--I have it!” said Bagheera, leaping</p>",
        "<p>up. “Go thou down quickly to the men’s huts in</p>\n<p>the valley, and take some of the Red Flower which</p>\n<p>they grow there, so that when the time comes thou</p>\n<p>mayest have even a stronger friend than I or Baloo</p>\n<p>or those of the Pack that love thee. Get the</p>\n<p>Red Flower.” By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no</p>\n<p>creature in the jungle will call fire by its proper</p>",
        "<p>name. Every beast lives in deadly fear of it, and</p>\n<p>invents a hundred ways of describing it. “The Red Flower?”</p>\n<p>said Mowgli. “That grows outside their huts in the twilight.</p>\n<p>I will get some.” “There speaks the man’s cub,” said</p>\n<p>Bagheera proudly. “Remember that it grows in little pots. Get</p>\n<p>one swiftly, and keep it by thee for time of</p>\n<p>need.” “Good!” said Mowgli. “I go. But art thou sure,</p>",
        "<p>O my Bagheera”--he slipped his arm around the splendid neck</p>\n<p>and looked deep into the big eyes--“art thou sure that</p>\n<p>all this is Shere Khan’s doing?” “By the Broken Lock</p>\n<p>that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.” “Then, by</p>\n<p>the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan</p>\n<p>full tale for this, and it may be a little</p>\n<p>over,” said Mowgli, and he bounded away. “That is a</p>",
        "<p>man. That is all a man,” said Bagheera to himself,</p>\n<p>lying down again. “Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker</p>\n<p>hunting than that frog-hunt of thine ten years ago!” Mowgli</p>\n<p>was far and far through the forest, running hard, and</p>\n<p>his heart was hot in him. He came to the</p>\n<p>cave as the evening mist rose, and drew breath, and</p>\n<p>looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but Mother</p>",
        "<p>Wolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his</p>\n<p>breathing that something was troubling her frog. “What is it,</p>\n<p>Son?” she said. “Some bat’s chatter of Shere Khan,” he</p>\n<p>called back. “I hunt among the plowed fields tonight,” and</p>\n<p>he plunged downward through the bushes, to the stream at</p>\n<p>the bottom of the valley. There he checked, for he</p>\n<p>heard the yell of the Pack hunting, heard the bellow</p>",
        "<p>of a hunted Sambhur, and the snort as the buck</p>\n<p>turned at bay. Then there were wicked, bitter howls from</p>\n<p>the young wolves: “Akela! Akela! Let the Lone Wolf show</p>\n<p>his strength. Room for the leader of the Pack! Spring,</p>\n<p>Akela!” The Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his</p>\n<p>hold, for Mowgli heard the snap of his teeth and</p>\n<p>then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him over with</p>",
        "<p>his forefoot. He did not wait for anything more, but</p>\n<p>dashed on; and the yells grew fainter behind him as</p>\n<p>he ran into the croplands where the villagers lived. “Bagheera</p>\n<p>spoke truth,” he panted, as he nestled down in some</p>\n<p>cattle fodder by the window of a hut. “To-morrow is</p>\n<p>one day both for Akela and for me.” Then he</p>\n<p>pressed his face close to the window and watched the</p>",
        "<p>fire on the hearth. He saw the husbandman’s wife get</p>\n<p>up and feed it in the night with black lumps.</p>\n<p>And when the morning came and the mists were all</p>\n<p>white and cold, he saw the man’s child pick up</p>\n<p>a wicker pot plastered inside with earth, fill it with</p>\n<p>lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his blanket, and</p>\n<p>go out to tend the cows in the byre. “Is</p>",
        "<p>that all?” said Mowgli. “If a cub can do it,</p>\n<p>there is nothing to fear.” So he strode round the</p>\n<p>corner and met the boy, took the pot from his</p>\n<p>hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled</p>\n<p>with fear. “They are very like me,” said Mowgli, blowing</p>\n<p>into the pot as he had seen the woman do.</p>\n<p>“This thing will die if I do not give it</p>",
        "<p>things to eat”; and he dropped twigs and dried bark</p>\n<p>on the red stuff. Halfway up the hill he met</p>\n<p>Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his</p>\n<p>coat. “Akela has missed,” said the Panther. “They would have</p>\n<p>killed him last night, but they needed thee also. They</p>\n<p>were looking for thee on the hill.” “I was among</p>\n<p>the plowed lands. I am ready. See!” Mowgli held up</p>",
        "<p>the fire-pot. “Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a</p>\n<p>dry branch into that stuff, and presently the Red Flower</p>\n<p>blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not afraid?”</p>\n<p>“No. Why should I fear? I remember now--if it is</p>\n<p>not a dream--how, before I was a Wolf, I lay</p>\n<p>beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and pleasant.”</p>\n<p>All that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his</p>",
        "<p>fire pot and dipping dry branches into it to see</p>\n<p>how they looked. He found a branch that satisfied him,</p>\n<p>and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave</p>\n<p>and told him rudely enough that he was wanted at</p>\n<p>the Council Rock, he laughed till Tabaqui ran away. Then</p>\n<p>Mowgli went to the Council, still laughing. Akela the Lone</p>\n<p>Wolf lay by the side of his rock as a</p>",
        "<p>sign that the leadership of the Pack was open, and</p>\n<p>Shere Khan with his following of scrap-fed wolves walked to</p>\n<p>and fro openly being flattered. Bagheera lay close to Mowgli,</p>\n<p>and the fire pot was between Mowgli’s knees. When they</p>\n<p>were all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak--a thing</p>\n<p>he would never have dared to do when Akela was</p>\n<p>in his prime. “He has no right,” whispered Bagheera. “Say</p>",
        "<p>so. He is a dog’s son. He will be frightened.”</p>\n<p>Mowgli sprang to his feet. “Free People,” he cried, “does</p>\n<p>Shere Khan lead the Pack? What has a tiger to</p>\n<p>do with our leadership?” “Seeing that the leadership is yet</p>\n<p>open, and being asked to speak--” Shere Khan began. “By</p>\n<p>whom?” said Mowgli. “Are we all jackals, to fawn on</p>\n<p>this cattle butcher? The leadership of the Pack is with</p>",
        "<p>the Pack alone.” There were yells of “Silence, thou man’s</p>\n<p>cub!” “Let him speak. He has kept our Law”; and</p>\n<p>at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: “Let the</p>\n<p>Dead Wolf speak.” When a leader of the Pack has</p>\n<p>missed his kill, he is called the Dead Wolf as</p>\n<p>long as he lives, which is not long. Akela raised</p>\n<p>his old head wearily:-- “Free People, and ye too, jackals</p>",
        "<p>of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons I have led ye</p>\n<p>to and from the kill, and in all that time</p>\n<p>not one has been trapped or maimed. Now I have</p>\n<p>missed my kill. Ye know how that plot was made.</p>\n<p>Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried</p>\n<p>buck to make my weakness known. It was cleverly done.</p>\n<p>Your right is to kill me here on the Council</p>",
        "<p>Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an</p>\n<p>end of the Lone Wolf? For it is my right,</p>\n<p>by the Law of the Jungle, that ye come one</p>\n<p>by one.” There was a long hush, for no single</p>\n<p>wolf cared to fight Akela to the death. Then Shere</p>\n<p>Khan roared: “Bah! What have we to do with this</p>\n<p>toothless fool? He is doomed to die! It is the</p>",
        "<p>man-cub who has lived too long. Free People, he was</p>\n<p>my meat from the first. Give him to me. I</p>\n<p>am weary of this man-wolf folly. He has troubled the</p>\n<p>jungle for ten seasons. Give me the man-cub, or I</p>\n<p>will hunt here always, and not give you one bone.</p>\n<p>He is a man, a man’s child, and from the</p>\n<p>marrow of my bones I hate him!” Then more than</p>",
        "<p>half the Pack yelled: “A man! A man! What has</p>\n<p>a man to do with us? Let him go to</p>\n<p>his own place.” “And turn all the people of the</p>\n<p>villages against us?” clamored Shere Khan. “No, give him to</p>\n<p>me. He is a man, and none of us can</p>\n<p>look him between the eyes.” Akela lifted his head again</p>\n<p>and said, “He has eaten our food. He has slept</p>",
        "<p>with us. He has driven game for us. He has</p>\n<p>broken no word of the Law of the Jungle.” “Also,</p>\n<p>I paid for him with a bull when he was</p>\n<p>accepted. The worth of a bull is little, but Bagheera’s</p>\n<p>honor is something that he will perhaps fight for,” said</p>\n<p>Bagheera in his gentlest voice. “A bull paid ten years</p>\n<p>ago!” the Pack snarled. “What do we care for bones</p>",
        "<p>ten years old?” “Or for a pledge?” said Bagheera, his</p>\n<p>white teeth bared under his lip. “Well are ye called</p>\n<p>the Free People!” “No man’s cub can run with the</p>\n<p>people of the jungle,” howled Shere Khan. “Give him to</p>\n<p>me!” “He is our brother in all but blood,” Akela</p>\n<p>went on, “and ye would kill him here! In truth,</p>\n<p>I have lived too long. Some of ye are eaters</p>",
        "<p>of cattle, and of others I have heard that, under</p>\n<p>Shere Khan’s teaching, ye go by dark night and snatch</p>\n<p>children from the villager’s doorstep. Therefore I know ye to</p>\n<p>be cowards, and it is to cowards I speak. It</p>\n<p>is certain that I must die, and my life is</p>\n<p>of no worth, or I would offer that in the</p>\n<p>man-cub’s place. But for the sake of the Honor of</p>",
        "<p>the Pack,--a little matter that by being without a leader</p>\n<p>ye have forgotten,--I promise that if ye let the man-cub</p>\n<p>go to his own place, I will not, when my</p>\n<p>time comes to die, bare one tooth against ye. I</p>\n<p>will die without fighting. That will at least save the</p>\n<p>Pack three lives. More I cannot do; but if ye</p>\n<p>will, I can save ye the shame that comes of</p>",
        "<p>killing a brother against whom there is no fault--a brother</p>\n<p>spoken for and bought into the Pack according to the</p>\n<p>Law of the Jungle.” “He is a man--a man--a man!”</p>\n<p>snarled the Pack. And most of the wolves began to</p>\n<p>gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to switch.</p>\n<p>“Now the business is in thy hands,” said Bagheera to</p>\n<p>Mowgli. “We can do no more except fight.” Mowgli stood</p>",
        "<p>upright--the fire pot in his hands. Then he stretched out</p>\n<p>his arms, and yawned in the face of the Council;</p>\n<p>but he was furious with rage and sorrow, for, wolflike,</p>\n<p>the wolves had never told him how they hated him.</p>\n<p>“Listen you!” he cried. “There is no need for this</p>\n<p>dog’s jabber. Ye have told me so often tonight that</p>\n<p>I am a man (and indeed I would have been</p>",
        "<p>a wolf with you to my life’s end) that I</p>\n<p>feel your words are true. So I do not call</p>\n<p>ye my brothers any more, but sag [dogs], as a</p>\n<p>man should. What ye will do, and what ye will</p>\n<p>not do, is not yours to say. That matter is</p>\n<p>with me; and that we may see the matter more</p>\n<p>plainly, I, the man, have brought here a little of</p>",
        "<p>the Red Flower which ye, dogs, fear.” He flung the</p>\n<p>fire pot on the ground, and some of the red</p>\n<p>coals lit a tuft of dried moss that flared up,</p>\n<p>as all the Council drew back in terror before the</p>\n<p>leaping flames. Mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire</p>\n<p>till the twigs lit and crackled, and whirled it above</p>\n<p>his head among the cowering wolves. “Thou art the master,”</p>",
        "<p>said Bagheera in an undertone. “Save Akela from the death.</p>\n<p>He was ever thy friend.” Akela, the grim old wolf</p>\n<p>who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave</p>\n<p>one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all</p>\n<p>naked, his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in</p>\n<p>the light of the blazing branch that made the shadows</p>\n<p>jump and quiver. “Good!” said Mowgli, staring round slowly. “I</p>",
        "<p>see that ye are dogs. I go from you to</p>\n<p>my own people--if they be my own people. The jungle</p>\n<p>is shut to me, and I must forget your talk</p>\n<p>and your companionship. But I will be more merciful than</p>\n<p>ye are. Because I was all but your brother in</p>\n<p>blood, I promise that when I am a man among</p>\n<p>men I will not betray ye to men as ye</p>",
        "<p>have betrayed me.” He kicked the fire with his foot,</p>\n<p>and the sparks flew up. “There shall be no war</p>\n<p>between any of us in the Pack. But here is</p>\n<p>a debt to pay before I go.” He strode forward</p>\n<p>to where Shere Khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames,</p>\n<p>and caught him by the tuft on his chin. Bagheera</p>\n<p>followed in case of accidents. “Up, dog!” Mowgli cried. “Up,</p>",
        "<p>when a man speaks, or I will set that coat</p>\n<p>ablaze!” Shere Khan’s ears lay flat back on his head,</p>\n<p>and he shut his eyes, for the blazing branch was</p>\n<p>very near. “This cattle-killer said he would kill me in</p>\n<p>the Council because he had not killed me when I</p>\n<p>was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat</p>\n<p>dogs when we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, and</p>",
        "<p>I ram the Red Flower down thy gullet!” He beat</p>\n<p>Shere Khan over the head with the branch, and the</p>\n<p>tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear. “Pah!</p>\n<p>Singed jungle cat--go now! But remember when next I come</p>\n<p>to the Council Rock, as a man should come, it</p>\n<p>will be with Shere Khan’s hide on my head. For</p>\n<p>the rest, Akela goes free to live as he pleases.</p>",
        "<p>Ye will not kill him, because that is not my</p>\n<p>will. Nor do I think that ye will sit here</p>\n<p>any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye were</p>\n<p>somebodies, instead of dogs whom I drive out--thus! Go!” The</p>\n<p>fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch,</p>\n<p>and Mowgli struck right and left round the circle, and</p>\n<p>the wolves ran howling with the sparks burning their fur.</p>",
        "<p>At last there were only Akela, Bagheera, and perhaps ten</p>\n<p>wolves that had taken Mowgli’s part. Then something began to</p>\n<p>hurt Mowgli inside him, as he had never been hurt</p>\n<p>in his life before, and he caught his breath and</p>\n<p>sobbed, and the tears ran down his face. “What is</p>\n<p>it? What is it?” he said. “I do not wish</p>\n<p>to leave the jungle, and I do not know what</p>",
        "<p>this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?” “No, Little Brother. That</p>\n<p>is only tears such as men use,” said Bagheera. “Now</p>\n<p>I know thou art a man, and a man’s cub</p>\n<p>no longer. The jungle is shut indeed to thee henceforward.</p>\n<p>Let them fall, Mowgli. They are only tears.” So Mowgli</p>\n<p>sat and cried as though his heart would break; and</p>\n<p>he had never cried in all his life before. “Now,”</p>",
        "<p>he said, “I will go to men. But first I</p>\n<p>must say farewell to my mother.” And he went to</p>\n<p>the cave where she lived with Father Wolf, and he</p>\n<p>cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably.</p>\n<p>“Ye will not forget me?” said Mowgli. “Never while we</p>\n<p>can follow a trail,” said the cubs. “Come to the</p>\n<p>foot of the hill when thou art a man, and</p>",
        "<p>we will talk to thee; and we will come into</p>\n<p>the croplands to play with thee by night.” “Come soon!”</p>\n<p>said Father Wolf. “Oh, wise little frog, come again soon;</p>\n<p>for we be old, thy mother and I.” “Come soon,”</p>\n<p>said Mother Wolf, “little naked son of mine. For, listen,</p>\n<p>child of man, I loved thee more than ever I</p>\n<p>loved my cubs.” “I will surely come,” said Mowgli. “And</p>",
        "<p>when I come it will be to lay out Shere</p>\n<p>Khan’s hide upon the Council Rock. Do not forget me!</p>\n<p>Tell them in the jungle never to forget me!” The</p>\n<p>dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the</p>\n<p>hillside alone, to meet those mysterious things that are called</p>\n<p>men. Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack As the dawn was</p>\n<p>breaking the Sambhur belled Once, twice and again! And a</p>",

Oppress</p>\n<p>not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as</p>",
        "<p>Sister and Brother, For though they are little and fubsy,</p>\n<p>it may be the Bear is their mother. “There is</p>\n<p>none like to me!” says the Cub in the pride</p>\n<p>of his earliest kill; But the jungle is large and</p>\n<p>the Cub he is small. Let him think and be</p>\n<p>still. _Maxims of Baloo_ All that is told here happened</p>\n<p>some time before Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee</p>",
        "<p>Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger.</p>\n<p>It was in the days when Baloo was teaching him</p>\n<p>the Law of the Jungle. The big, serious, old brown</p>\n<p>bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil, for</p>\n<p>the young wolves will only learn as much of the</p>\n<p>Law of the Jungle as applies to their own pack</p>\n<p>and tribe, and run away as soon as they can</p>",
        "<p>repeat the Hunting Verse--“Feet that make no noise; eyes that</p>\n<p>can see in the dark; ears that can hear the</p>\n<p>winds in their lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these</p>\n<p>things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the</p>\n<p>Jackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.” But Mowgli, as</p>\n<p>a man-cub, had to learn a great deal more than</p>\n<p>this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther would come lounging through</p>",
        "<p>the jungle to see how his pet was getting on,</p>\n<p>and would purr with his head against a tree while</p>\n<p>Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to Baloo. The boy could</p>\n<p>climb almost as well as he could swim, and swim</p>\n<p>almost as well as he could run. So Baloo, the</p>\n<p>Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water</p>\n<p>Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a sound</p>",
        "<p>one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when</p>\n<p>he came upon a hive of them fifty feet above</p>\n<p>ground; what to say to Mang the Bat when he</p>\n<p>disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how to</p>\n<p>warn the water-snakes in the pools before he splashed down</p>\n<p>among them. None of the Jungle People like being disturbed,</p>\n<p>and all are very ready to fly at an intruder.</p>",
        "<p>Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’ Hunting Call, which</p>\n<p>must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one</p>\n<p>of the Jungle-People hunts outside his own grounds. It means,</p>\n<p>translated, “Give me leave to hunt here because I am</p>\n<p>hungry.” And the answer is, “Hunt then for food, but</p>\n<p>not for pleasure.” All this will show you how much</p>\n<p>Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he grew very</p>",
        "<p>tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times.</p>\n<p>But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli</p>\n<p>had been cuffed and run off in a temper, “A</p>\n<p>man’s cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn</p>\n<p>all the Law of the Jungle.” “But think how small</p>\n<p>he is,” said the Black Panther, who would have spoiled</p>\n<p>Mowgli if he had had his own way. “How can</p>",
        "<p>his little head carry all thy long talk?” “Is there</p>\n<p>anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No.</p>\n<p>That is why I teach him these things, and that</p>\n<p>is why I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.”</p>\n<p>“Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?” Bagheera</p>\n<p>grunted. “His face is all bruised today by thy--softness. Ugh.”</p>\n<p>“Better he should be bruised from head to foot by</p>",
        "<p>me who love him than that he should come to</p>\n<p>harm through ignorance,” Baloo answered very earnestly. “I am now</p>\n<p>teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall</p>\n<p>protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and</p>\n<p>all that hunt on four feet, except his own pack.</p>\n<p>He can now claim protection, if he will only remember</p>\n<p>the words, from all in the jungle. Is not that</p>",
        "<p>worth a little beating?” “Well, look to it then that</p>\n<p>thou dost not kill the man-cub. He is no tree</p>\n<p>trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon. But what are</p>\n<p>those Master Words? I am more likely to give help</p>\n<p>than to ask it”--Bagheera stretched out one paw and admired</p>\n<p>the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end of it--“still I</p>\n<p>should like to know.” “I will call Mowgli and he</p>",
        "<p>shall say them--if he will. Come, Little Brother!” “My head</p>\n<p>is ringing like a bee tree,” said a sullen little</p>\n<p>voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree</p>\n<p>trunk very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the</p>\n<p>ground: “I come for Bagheera and not for thee, fat</p>\n<p>old Baloo!” “That is all one to me,” said Baloo,</p>\n<p>though he was hurt and grieved. “Tell Bagheera, then, the</p>",
        "<p>Master Words of the Jungle that I have taught thee</p>\n<p>this day.” “Master Words for which people?” said Mowgli, delighted</p>\n<p>to show off. “The jungle has many tongues. I know</p>\n<p>them all.” “A little thou knowest, but not much. See,</p>\n<p>O Bagheera, they never thank their teacher. Not one small</p>\n<p>wolfling has ever come back to thank old Baloo for</p>\n<p>his teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People, then--great scholar.”</p>",
        "<p>“We be of one blood, ye and I,” said Mowgli,</p>\n<p>giving the words the Bear accent which all the Hunting</p>\n<p>People use. “Good. Now for the birds.” Mowgli repeated, with</p>\n<p>the Kite’s whistle at the end of the sentence. “Now</p>\n<p>for the Snake-People,” said Bagheera. The answer was a perfectly</p>\n<p>indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his feet behind, clapped</p>\n<p>his hands together to applaud himself, and jumped on to</p>",
        "<p>Bagheera’s back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels</p>\n<p>on the glossy skin and making the worst faces he</p>\n<p>could think of at Baloo. “There--there! That was worth a</p>\n<p>little bruise,” said the brown bear tenderly. “Some day thou</p>\n<p>wilt remember me.” Then he turned aside to tell Bagheera</p>\n<p>how he had begged the Master Words from Hathi the</p>\n<p>Wild Elephant, who knows all about these things, and how</p>",
        "<p>Hathi had taken Mowgli down to a pool to get</p>\n<p>the Snake Word from a water-snake, because Baloo could not</p>\n<p>pronounce it, and how Mowgli was now reasonably safe against</p>\n<p>all accidents in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor</p>\n<p>beast would hurt him. “No one then is to be</p>\n<p>feared,” Baloo wound up, patting his big furry stomach with</p>\n<p>pride. “Except his own tribe,” said Bagheera, under his breath;</p>",
        "<p>and then aloud to Mowgli, “Have a care for my</p>\n<p>ribs, Little Brother! What is all this dancing up and</p>\n<p>down?” Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by</p>\n<p>pulling at Bagheera’s shoulder fur and kicking hard. When the</p>\n<p>two listened to him he was shouting at the top</p>\n<p>of his voice, “And so I shall have a tribe</p>\n<p>of my own, and lead them through the branches all</p>",
        "<p>day long.” “What is this new folly, little dreamer of</p>\n<p>dreams?” said Bagheera. “Yes, and throw branches and dirt at</p>\n<p>old Baloo,” Mowgli went on. “They have promised me this.</p>\n<p>Ah!” “Whoof!” Baloo’s big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera’s back,</p>\n<p>and as the boy lay between the big fore-paws he</p>\n<p>could see the Bear was angry. “Mowgli,” said Baloo, “thou</p>\n<p>hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the Monkey People.” Mowgli looked</p>",
        "<p>at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too,</p>\n<p>and Bagheera’s eyes were as hard as jade stones. “Thou</p>\n<p>hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people without</p>\n<p>a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame.” “When</p>\n<p>Baloo hurt my head,” said Mowgli (he was still on</p>\n<p>his back), “I went away, and the gray apes came</p>\n<p>down from the trees and had pity on me. No</p>",
        "<p>one else cared.” He snuffled a little. “The pity of</p>\n<p>the Monkey People!” Baloo snorted. “The stillness of the mountain</p>\n<p>stream! The cool of the summer sun! And then, man-cub?”</p>\n<p>“And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant</p>\n<p>things to eat, and they--they carried me in their arms</p>\n<p>up to the top of the trees and said I</p>\n<p>was their blood brother except that I had no tail,</p>",
        "<p>and should be their leader some day.” “They have no</p>\n<p>leader,” said Bagheera. “They lie. They have always lied.” “They</p>\n<p>were very kind and bade me come again. Why have</p>\n<p>I never been taken among the Monkey People? They stand</p>\n<p>on their feet as I do. They do not hit</p>\n<p>me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let</p>\n<p>me get up! Bad Baloo, let me up! I will</p>",
        "<p>play with them again.” “Listen, man-cub,” said the Bear, and</p>\n<p>his voice rumbled like thunder on a hot night. “I</p>\n<p>have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for</p>\n<p>all the peoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live</p>\n<p>in the trees. They have no law. They are outcasts.</p>\n<p>They have no speech of their own, but use the</p>\n<p>stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,</p>",
        "<p>and wait up above in the branches. Their way is</p>\n<p>not our way. They are without leaders. They have no</p>\n<p>remembrance. They boast and chatter and pretend that they are</p>\n<p>a great people about to do great affairs in the</p>\n<p>jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds</p>\n<p>to laughter and all is forgotten. We of the jungle</p>\n<p>have no dealings with them. We do not drink where</p>",
        "<p>the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys</p>\n<p>go; we do not hunt where they hunt; we do</p>\n<p>not die where they die. Hast thou ever heard me</p>\n<p>speak of the Bandar-log till today?” “No,” said Mowgli in</p>\n<p>a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo</p>\n<p>had finished. “The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths</p>\n<p>and out of their minds. They are very many, evil,</p>",
        "<p>dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they have any fixed</p>\n<p>desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we</p>\n<p>do not notice them even when they throw nuts and</p>\n<p>filth on our heads.” He had hardly spoken when a</p>\n<p>shower of nuts and twigs spattered down through the branches;</p>\n<p>and they could hear coughings and howlings and angry jumpings</p>\n<p>high up in the air among the thin branches. “The</p>",
        "<p>Monkey-People are forbidden,” said Baloo, “forbidden to the Jungle-People. Remember.”</p>\n<p>“Forbidden,” said Bagheera, “but I still think Baloo should have</p>\n<p>warned thee against them.” “I--I? How was I to guess</p>\n<p>he would play with such dirt. The Monkey People! Faugh!”</p>\n<p>A fresh shower came down on their heads and the</p>\n<p>two trotted away, taking Mowgli with them. What Baloo had</p>\n<p>said about the monkeys was perfectly true. They belonged to</p>",
        "<p>the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look up, there</p>\n<p>was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to</p>\n<p>cross each other’s path. But whenever they found a sick</p>\n<p>wolf, or a wounded tiger, or bear, the monkeys would</p>\n<p>torment him, and would throw sticks and nuts at any</p>\n<p>beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed.</p>\n<p>Then they would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite</p>",
        "<p>the Jungle-People to climb up their trees and fight them,</p>\n<p>or would start furious battles over nothing among themselves, and</p>\n<p>leave the dead monkeys where the Jungle-People could see them.</p>\n<p>They were always just going to have a leader, and</p>\n<p>laws and customs of their own, but they never did,</p>\n<p>because their memories would not hold over from day to</p>\n<p>day, and so they compromised things by making up a</p>",
        "<p>saying, “What the Bandar-log think now the jungle will think</p>\n<p>later,” and that comforted them a great deal. None of</p>\n<p>the beasts could reach them, but on the other hand</p>\n<p>none of the beasts would notice them, and that was</p>\n<p>why they were so pleased when Mowgli came to play</p>\n<p>with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was. They</p>\n<p>never meant to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything</p>",
        "<p>at all; but one of them invented what seemed to</p>\n<p>him a brilliant idea, and he told all the others</p>\n<p>that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in</p>\n<p>the tribe, because he could weave sticks together for protection</p>\n<p>from the wind; so, if they caught him, they could</p>\n<p>make him teach them. Of course Mowgli, as a woodcutter’s</p>\n<p>child, inherited all sorts of instincts, and used to make</p>",
        "<p>little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came</p>\n<p>to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the trees, considered</p>\n<p>his play most wonderful. This time, they said, they were</p>\n<p>really going to have a leader and become the wisest</p>\n<p>people in the jungle--so wise that everyone else would notice</p>\n<p>and envy them. Therefore they followed Baloo and Bagheera and</p>\n<p>Mowgli through the jungle very quietly till it was time</p>",
        "<p>for the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was very much</p>\n<p>ashamed of himself, slept between the Panther and the Bear,</p>\n<p>resolving to have no more to do with the Monkey</p>\n<p>People. The next thing he remembered was feeling hands on</p>\n<p>his legs and arms--hard, strong, little hands--and then a swash</p>\n<p>of branches in his face, and then he was staring</p>\n<p>down through the swaying boughs as Baloo woke the jungle</p>",
        "<p>with his deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk</p>\n<p>with every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled with triumph and</p>\n<p>scuffled away to the upper branches where Bagheera dared not</p>\n<p>follow, shouting: “He has noticed us! Bagheera has noticed us.</p>\n<p>All the Jungle-People admire us for our skill and our</p>\n<p>cunning.” Then they began their flight; and the flight of</p>\n<p>the Monkey-People through tree-land is one of the things nobody</p>",
        "<p>can describe. They have their regular roads and crossroads, up</p>\n<p>hills and down hills, all laid out from fifty to</p>\n<p>seventy or a hundred feet above ground, and by these</p>\n<p>they can travel even at night if necessary. Two of</p>\n<p>the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under the arms and swung</p>\n<p>off with him through the treetops, twenty feet at a</p>\n<p>bound. Had they been alone they could have gone twice</p>",
        "<p>as fast, but the boy’s weight held them back. Sick</p>\n<p>and giddy as Mowgli was he could not help enjoying</p>\n<p>the wild rush, though the glimpses of earth far down</p>\n<p>below frightened him, and the terrible check and jerk at</p>\n<p>the end of the swing over nothing but empty air</p>\n<p>brought his heart between his teeth. His escort would rush</p>\n<p>him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost</p>",
        "<p>branches crackle and bend under them, and then with a</p>\n<p>cough and a whoop would fling themselves into the air</p>\n<p>outward and downward, and bring up, hanging by their hands</p>\n<p>or their feet to the lower limbs of the next</p>\n<p>tree. Sometimes he could see for miles and miles across</p>\n<p>the still green jungle, as a man on the top</p>\n<p>of a mast can see for miles across the sea,</p>",
        "<p>and then the branches and leaves would lash him across</p>\n<p>the face, and he and his two guards would be</p>\n<p>almost down to earth again. So, bounding and crashing and</p>\n<p>whooping and yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept along</p>\n<p>the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner. For a time he</p>\n<p>was afraid of being dropped. Then he grew angry but</p>\n<p>knew better than to struggle, and then he began to</p>",
        "<p>think. The first thing was to send back word to</p>\n<p>Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys were</p>\n<p>going, he knew his friends would be left far behind.</p>\n<p>It was useless to look down, for he could only</p>\n<p>see the topsides of the branches, so he stared upward</p>\n<p>and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite</p>\n<p>balancing and wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle</p>",
        "<p>waiting for things to die. Rann saw that the monkeys</p>\n<p>were carrying something, and dropped a few hundred yards to</p>\n<p>find out whether their load was good to eat. He</p>\n<p>whistled with surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up</p>\n<p>to a treetop and heard him give the Kite call</p>\n<p>for--“We be of one blood, thou and I.” The waves</p>\n<p>of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced</p>",
        "<p>away to the next tree in time to see the</p>\n<p>little brown face come up again. “Mark my trail!” Mowgli</p>\n<p>shouted. “Tell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera of</p>\n<p>the Council Rock.” “In whose name, Brother?” Rann had never</p>\n<p>seen Mowgli before, though of course he had heard of</p>\n<p>him. “Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my</p>\n<p>trail!” The last words were shrieked as he was being</p>",
        "<p>swung through the air, but Rann nodded and rose up</p>\n<p>till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust,</p>\n<p>and there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the</p>\n<p>swaying of the treetops as Mowgli’s escort whirled along. “They</p>\n<p>never go far,” he said with a chuckle. “They never</p>\n<p>do what they set out to do. Always pecking at</p>\n<p>new things are the Bandar-log. This time, if I have</p>",
        "<p>any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for themselves, for</p>\n<p>Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know,</p>\n<p>kill more than goats.” So he rocked on his wings,</p>\n<p>his feet gathered up under him, and waited. Meantime, Baloo</p>\n<p>and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera climbed</p>\n<p>as he had never climbed before, but the thin branches</p>\n<p>broke beneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws</p>",
        "<p>full of bark. “Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?”</p>\n<p>he roared to poor Baloo, who had set off at</p>\n<p>a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys.</p>\n<p>“What was the use of half slaying him with blows</p>\n<p>if thou didst not warn him?” “Haste! O haste! We--we</p>\n<p>may catch them yet!” Baloo panted. “At that speed! It</p>\n<p>would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the Law--cub-beater--a</p>",
        "<p>mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee</p>\n<p>open. Sit still and think! Make a plan. This is</p>\n<p>no time for chasing. They may drop him if we</p>\n<p>follow too close.” “Arrula! Whoo! They may have dropped him</p>\n<p>already, being tired of carrying him. Who can trust the</p>\n<p>Bandar-log? Put dead bats on my head! Give me black</p>\n<p>bones to eat! Roll me into the hives of the</p>",
        "<p>wild bees that I may be stung to death, and</p>\n<p>bury me with the Hyaena, for I am most miserable</p>\n<p>of bears! Arulala! Wahooa! O Mowgli, Mowgli! Why did I</p>\n<p>not warn thee against the Monkey-Folk instead of breaking thy</p>\n<p>head? Now perhaps I may have knocked the day’s lesson</p>\n<p>out of his mind, and he will be alone in</p>\n<p>the jungle without the Master Words.” Baloo clasped his paws</p>",
        "<p>over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning. “At</p>\n<p>least he gave me all the Words correctly a little</p>\n<p>time ago,” said Bagheera impatiently. “Baloo, thou hast neither memory</p>\n<p>nor respect. What would the jungle think if I, the</p>\n<p>Black Panther, curled myself up like Ikki the Porcupine, and</p>\n<p>howled?” “What do I care what the jungle thinks? He</p>\n<p>may be dead by now.” “Unless and until they drop</p>",
        "<p>him from the branches in sport, or kill him out</p>\n<p>of idleness, I have no fear for the man-cub. He</p>\n<p>is wise and well taught, and above all he has</p>\n<p>the eyes that make the Jungle-People afraid. But (and it</p>\n<p>is a great evil) he is in the power of</p>\n<p>the Bandar-log, and they, because they live in trees, have</p>\n<p>no fear of any of our people.” Bagheera licked one</p>",
        "<p>forepaw thoughtfully. “Fool that I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging</p>\n<p>fool that I am,” said Baloo, uncoiling himself with a</p>\n<p>jerk, “it is true what Hathi the Wild Elephant says:</p>\n<p>`To each his own fear’; and they, the Bandar-log, fear</p>\n<p>Kaa the Rock Snake. He can climb as well as</p>\n<p>they can. He steals the young monkeys in the night.</p>\n<p>The whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold.</p>",
        "<p>Let us go to Kaa.” “What will he do for</p>\n<p>us? He is not of our tribe, being footless--and with</p>\n<p>most evil eyes,” said Bagheera. “He is very old and</p>\n<p>very cunning. Above all, he is always hungry,” said Baloo</p>\n<p>hopefully. “Promise him many goats.” “He sleeps for a full</p>\n<p>month after he has once eaten. He may be asleep</p>\n<p>now, and even were he awake what if he would</p>",
        "<p>rather kill his own goats?” Bagheera, who did not know</p>\n<p>much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious. “Then in that case,</p>\n<p>thou and I together, old hunter, might make him see</p>\n<p>reason.” Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the</p>\n<p>Panther, and they went off to look for Kaa the</p>\n<p>Rock Python. They found him stretched out on a warm</p>\n<p>ledge in the afternoon sun, admiring his beautiful new coat,</p>",
        "<p>for he had been in retirement for the last ten</p>\n<p>days changing his skin, and now he was very splendid--darting</p>\n<p>his big blunt-nosed head along the ground, and twisting the</p>\n<p>thirty feet of his body into fantastic knots and curves,</p>\n<p>and licking his lips as he thought of his dinner</p>\n<p>to come. “He has not eaten,” said Baloo, with a</p>\n<p>grunt of relief, as soon as he saw the beautifully</p>",
        "<p>mottled brown and yellow jacket. “Be careful, Bagheera! He is</p>\n<p>always a little blind after he has changed his skin,</p>\n<p>and very quick to strike.” Kaa was not a poison</p>\n<p>snake--in fact he rather despised the poison snakes as cowards--but</p>\n<p>his strength lay in his hug, and when he had</p>\n<p>once lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no</p>\n<p>more to be said. “Good hunting!” cried Baloo, sitting up</p>",
        "<p>on his haunches. Like all snakes of his breed Kaa</p>\n<p>was rather deaf, and did not hear the call at</p>\n<p>first. Then he curled up ready for any accident, his</p>\n<p>head lowered. “Good hunting for us all,” he answered. “Oho,</p>\n<p>Baloo, what dost thou do here? Good hunting, Bagheera. One</p>\n<p>of us at least needs food. Is there any news</p>\n<p>of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young</p>",
        "<p>buck? I am as empty as a dried well.” “We</p>\n<p>are hunting,” said Baloo carelessly. He knew that you must</p>\n<p>not hurry Kaa. He is too big. “Give me permission</p>\n<p>to come with you,” said Kaa. “A blow more or</p>\n<p>less is nothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I--I</p>\n<p>have to wait and wait for days in a wood-path</p>\n<p>and climb half a night on the mere chance of</p>",
        "<p>a young ape. Psshaw! The branches are not what they</p>\n<p>were when I was young. Rotten twigs and dry boughs</p>\n<p>are they all.” “Maybe thy great weight has something to</p>\n<p>do with the matter,” said Baloo. “I am a fair</p>\n<p>length--a fair length,” said Kaa with a little pride. “But</p>\n<p>for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown</p>\n<p>timber. I came very near to falling on my last</p>",
        "<p>hunt--very near indeed--and the noise of my slipping, for my</p>\n<p>tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the</p>\n<p>Bandar-log, and they called me most evil names.” “Footless, yellow</p>\n<p>earth-worm,” said Bagheera under his whiskers, as though he were</p>\n<p>trying to remember something. “Sssss! Have they ever called me</p>\n<p>that?” said Kaa. “Something of that kind it was that</p>\n<p>they shouted to us last moon, but we never noticed</p>",
        "<p>them. They will say anything--even that thou hast lost all</p>\n<p>thy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a</p>\n<p>kid, because (they are indeed shameless, these Bandar-log)--because thou art</p>\n<p>afraid of the he-goat’s horns,” Bagheera went on sweetly. Now</p>\n<p>a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very</p>\n<p>seldom shows that he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera</p>\n<p>could see the big swallowing muscles on either side of</p>",
        "<p>Kaa’s throat ripple and bulge. “The Bandar-log have shifted their</p>\n<p>grounds,” he said quietly. “When I came up into the</p>\n<p>sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops.” “It--it</p>\n<p>is the Bandar-log that we follow now,” said Baloo, but</p>\n<p>the words stuck in his throat, for that was the</p>\n<p>first time in his memory that one of the Jungle-People</p>\n<p>had owned to being interested in the doings of the</p>",
        "<p>monkeys. “Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that</p>\n<p>takes two such hunters--leaders in their own jungle I am</p>\n<p>certain--on the trail of the Bandar-log,” Kaa replied courteously, as</p>\n<p>he swelled with curiosity. “Indeed,” Baloo began, “I am no</p>\n<p>more than the old and sometimes very foolish Teacher of</p>\n<p>the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera here--” “Is</p>\n<p>Bagheera,” said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with</p>",
        "<p>a snap, for he did not believe in being humble.</p>\n<p>“The trouble is this, Kaa. Those nut-stealers and pickers of</p>\n<p>palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of whom thou</p>\n<p>hast perhaps heard.” “I heard some news from Ikki (his</p>\n<p>quills make him presumptuous) of a man-thing that was entered</p>\n<p>into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki</p>\n<p>is full of stories half heard and very badly told.”</p>",
        "<p>“But it is true. He is such a man-cub as</p>\n<p>never was,” said Baloo. “The best and wisest and boldest</p>\n<p>of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall make the name of</p>\n<p>Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides, I--we--love him,</p>\n<p>Kaa.” “Ts! Ts!” said Kaa, weaving his head to and</p>\n<p>fro. “I also have known what love is. There are</p>\n<p>tales I could tell that--” “That need a clear night</p>",
        "<p>when we are all well fed to praise properly,” said</p>\n<p>Bagheera quickly. “Our man-cub is in the hands of the</p>\n<p>Bandar-log now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People</p>\n<p>they fear Kaa alone.” “They fear me alone. They have</p>\n<p>good reason,” said Kaa. “Chattering, foolish, vain--vain, foolish, and chattering,</p>\n<p>are the monkeys. But a man-thing in their hands is</p>\n<p>in no good luck. They grow tired of the nuts</p>",
        "<p>they pick, and throw them down. They carry a branch</p>\n<p>half a day, meaning to do great things with it,</p>\n<p>and then they snap it in two. That man-thing is</p>\n<p>not to be envied. They called me also--`yellow fish’ was</p>\n<p>it not?” “Worm--worm--earth-worm,” said Bagheera, “as well as other things</p>\n<p>which I cannot now say for shame.” “We must remind</p>\n<p>them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp! We must</p>",
        "<p>help their wandering memories. Now, whither went they with the</p>\n<p>cub?” “The jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe,”</p>\n<p>said Baloo. “We had thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa.”</p>\n<p>“I? How? I take them when they come in my</p>\n<p>way, but I do not hunt the Bandar-log, or frogs--or</p>\n<p>green scum on a water-hole, for that matter.” “Up, Up!</p>\n<p>Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo of the</p>",
        "<p>Seeonee Wolf Pack!” Baloo looked up to see where the</p>\n<p>voice came from, and there was Rann the Kite, sweeping</p>\n<p>down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of</p>\n<p>his wings. It was near Rann’s bedtime, but he had</p>\n<p>ranged all over the jungle looking for the Bear and</p>\n<p>had missed him in the thick foliage. “What is it?”</p>\n<p>said Baloo. “I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log. He</p>",
        "<p>bade me tell you. I watched. The Bandar-log have taken</p>\n<p>him beyond the river to the monkey city--to the Cold</p>\n<p>Lairs. They may stay there for a night, or ten</p>\n<p>nights, or an hour. I have told the bats to</p>\n<p>watch through the dark time. That is my message. Good</p>\n<p>hunting, all you below!” “Full gorge and a deep sleep</p>\n<p>to you, Rann,” cried Bagheera. “I will remember thee in</p>",
        "<p>my next kill, and put aside the head for thee</p>\n<p>alone, O best of kites!” “It is nothing. It is</p>\n<p>nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could have</p>\n<p>done no less,” and Rann circled up again to his</p>\n<p>roost. “He has not forgotten to use his tongue,” said</p>\n<p>Baloo with a chuckle of pride. “To think of one</p>\n<p>so young remembering the Master Word for the birds too</p>",
        "<p>while he was being pulled across trees!” “It was most</p>\n<p>firmly driven into him,” said Bagheera. “But I am proud</p>\n<p>of him, and now we must go to the Cold</p>\n<p>Lairs.” They all knew where that place was, but few</p>\n<p>of the Jungle People ever went there, because what they</p>\n<p>called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted city, lost</p>\n<p>and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a</p>",
        "<p>place that men have once used. The wild boar will,</p>\n<p>but the hunting tribes do not. Besides, the monkeys lived</p>\n<p>there as much as they could be said to live</p>\n<p>anywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of</p>\n<p>it except in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks</p>\n<p>and reservoirs held a little water. [Illustration: The “Cold Lairs”]</p>\n<p>“It is half a night’s journey--at full speed,” said Bagheera,</p>",
        "<p>and Baloo looked very serious. “I will go as fast</p>\n<p>as I can,” he said anxiously. “We dare not wait</p>\n<p>for thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go on the quick-foot--Kaa</p>\n<p>and I.” “Feet or no feet, I can keep abreast</p>\n<p>of all thy four,” said Kaa shortly. Baloo made one</p>\n<p>effort to hurry, but had to sit down panting, and</p>\n<p>so they left him to come on later, while Bagheera</p>",
        "<p>hurried forward, at the quick panther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but,</p>\n<p>strive as Bagheera might, the huge Rock-python held level with</p>\n<p>him. When they came to a hill stream, Bagheera gained,</p>\n<p>because he bounded across while Kaa swam, his head and</p>\n<p>two feet of his neck clearing the water, but on</p>\n<p>level ground Kaa made up the distance. “By the Broken</p>\n<p>Lock that freed me,” said Bagheera, when twilight had fallen,</p>",
        "<p>“thou art no slow goer!” “I am hungry,” said Kaa.</p>\n<p>“Besides, they called me speckled frog.” “Worm--earth-worm, and yellow to</p>\n<p>boot.” “All one. Let us go on,” and Kaa seemed</p>\n<p>to pour himself along the ground, finding the shortest road</p>\n<p>with his steady eyes, and keeping to it. In the</p>\n<p>Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of Mowgli’s friends</p>\n<p>at all. They had brought the boy to the Lost</p>",
        "<p>City, and were very much pleased with themselves for the</p>\n<p>time. Mowgli had never seen an Indian city before, and</p>\n<p>though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed</p>\n<p>very wonderful and splendid. Some king had built it long</p>\n<p>ago on a little hill. You could still trace the</p>\n<p>stone causeways that led up to the ruined gates where</p>\n<p>the last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted</p>",
        "<p>hinges. Trees had grown into and out of the walls;</p>\n<p>the battlements were tumbled down and decayed, and wild creepers</p>\n<p>hung out of the windows of the towers on the</p>\n<p>walls in bushy hanging clumps. A great roofless palace crowned</p>\n<p>the hill, and the marble of the courtyards and the</p>\n<p>fountains was split, and stained with red and green, and</p>\n<p>the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king’s elephants</p>",
        "<p>used to live had been thrust up and apart by</p>\n<p>grasses and young trees. From the palace you could see</p>\n<p>the rows and rows of roofless houses that made up</p>\n<p>the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness; the</p>\n<p>shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in</p>\n<p>the square where four roads met; the pits and dimples</p>\n<p>at street corners where the public wells once stood, and</p>",
        "<p>the shattered domes of temples with wild figs sprouting on</p>\n<p>their sides. The monkeys called the place their city, and</p>\n<p>pretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the</p>\n<p>forest. And yet they never knew what the buildings were</p>\n<p>made for nor how to use them. They would sit</p>\n<p>in circles on the hall of the king’s council chamber,</p>\n<p>and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or</p>",
        "<p>they would run in and out of the roofless houses</p>\n<p>and collect pieces of plaster and old bricks in a</p>\n<p>corner, and forget where they had hidden them, and fight</p>\n<p>and cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to</p>\n<p>play up and down the terraces of the king’s garden,</p>\n<p>where they would shake the rose trees and the oranges</p>\n<p>in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall. They</p>",
        "<p>explored all the passages and dark tunnels in the palace</p>\n<p>and the hundreds of little dark rooms, but they never</p>\n<p>remembered what they had seen and what they had not;</p>\n<p>and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds</p>\n<p>telling each other that they were doing as men did.</p>\n<p>They drank at the tanks and made the water all</p>\n<p>muddy, and then they fought over it, and then they</p>",
        "<p>would all rush together in mobs and shout: “There is</p>\n<p>no one in the jungle so wise and good and</p>\n<p>clever and strong and gentle as the Bandar-log.” Then all</p>\n<p>would begin again till they grew tired of the city</p>\n<p>and went back to the tree-tops, hoping the Jungle-People would</p>\n<p>notice them. Mowgli, who had been trained under the Law</p>\n<p>of the Jungle, did not like or understand this kind</p>",
        "<p>of life. The monkeys dragged him into the Cold Lairs</p>\n<p>late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep,</p>\n<p>as Mowgli would have done after a long journey, they</p>\n<p>joined hands and danced about and sang their foolish songs.</p>\n<p>One of the monkeys made a speech and told his</p>\n<p>companions that Mowgli’s capture marked a new thing in the</p>\n<p>history of the Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show</p>",
        "<p>them how to weave sticks and canes together as a</p>\n<p>protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked up some creepers</p>\n<p>and began to work them in and out, and the</p>\n<p>monkeys tried to imitate; but in a very few minutes</p>\n<p>they lost interest and began to pull their friends’ tails</p>\n<p>or jump up and down on all fours, coughing. “I</p>\n<p>wish to eat,” said Mowgli. “I am a stranger in</p>",
        "<p>this part of the jungle. Bring me food, or give</p>\n<p>me leave to hunt here.” Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded</p>\n<p>away to bring him nuts and wild pawpaws. But they</p>\n<p>fell to fighting on the road, and it was too</p>\n<p>much trouble to go back with what was left of</p>\n<p>the fruit. Mowgli was sore and angry as well as</p>\n<p>hungry, and he roamed through the empty city giving the</p>",
        "<p>Strangers’ Hunting Call from time to time, but no one</p>\n<p>answered him, and Mowgli felt that he had reached a</p>\n<p>very bad place indeed. “All that Baloo has said about</p>\n<p>the Bandar-log is true,” he thought to himself. “They have</p>\n<p>no Law, no Hunting Call, and no leaders--nothing but foolish</p>\n<p>words and little picking thievish hands. So if I am</p>\n<p>starved or killed here, it will be all my own</p>",
        "<p>fault. But I must try to return to my own</p>\n<p>jungle. Baloo will surely beat me, but that is better</p>\n<p>than chasing silly rose leaves with the Bandar-log.” No sooner</p>\n<p>had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys</p>\n<p>pulled him back, telling him that he did not know</p>\n<p>how happy he was, and pinching him to make him</p>\n<p>grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but went</p>",
        "<p>with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red</p>\n<p>sandstone reservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was</p>\n<p>a ruined summer-house of white marble in the center of</p>\n<p>the terrace, built for queens dead a hundred years ago.</p>\n<p>The domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up</p>\n<p>the underground passage from the palace by which the queens</p>\n<p>used to enter. But the walls were made of screens</p>",
        "<p>of marble tracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians</p>\n<p>and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came</p>\n<p>up behind the hill it shone through the open work,</p>\n<p>casting shadows on the ground like black velvet embroidery. Sore,</p>\n<p>sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not help</p>\n<p>laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to</p>\n<p>tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle</p>",
        "<p>they were, and how foolish he was to wish to</p>\n<p>leave them. “We are great. We are free. We are</p>\n<p>wonderful. We are the most wonderful people in all the</p>\n<p>jungle! We all say so, and so it must be</p>\n<p>true,” they shouted. “Now as you are a new listener</p>\n<p>and can carry our words back to the Jungle-People so</p>\n<p>that they may notice us in future, we will tell</p>",
        "<p>you all about our most excellent selves.” Mowgli made no</p>\n<p>objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on</p>\n<p>the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the</p>\n<p>praises of the Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for</p>\n<p>want of breath they would all shout together: “This is</p>\n<p>true; we all say so.” Mowgli nodded and blinked, and</p>\n<p>said “Yes” when they asked him a question, and his</p>",
        "<p>head spun with the noise. “Tabaqui the Jackal must have</p>\n<p>bitten all these people,” he said to himself, “and now</p>\n<p>they have madness. Certainly this is _dewanee_, the madness. Do</p>\n<p>they never go to sleep? Now there is a cloud</p>\n<p>coming to cover that moon. If it were only a</p>\n<p>big enough cloud I might try to run away in</p>\n<p>the darkness. But I am tired.” That same cloud was</p>",
        "<p>being watched by two good friends in the ruined ditch</p>\n<p>below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well</p>\n<p>how dangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not</p>\n<p>wish to run any risks. The monkeys never fight unless</p>\n<p>they are a hundred to one, and few in the</p>\n<p>jungle care for those odds. “I will go to the</p>\n<p>west wall,” Kaa whispered, “and come down swiftly with the</p>",
        "<p>slope of the ground in my favor. They will not</p>\n<p>throw themselves upon my back in their hundreds, but--” “I</p>\n<p>know it,” said Bagheera. “Would that Baloo were here, but</p>\n<p>we must do what we can. When that cloud covers</p>\n<p>the moon I shall go to the terrace. They hold</p>\n<p>some sort of council there over the boy.” “Good hunting,”</p>\n<p>said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall.</p>",
        "<p>That happened to be the least ruined of any, and</p>\n<p>the big snake was delayed awhile before he could find</p>\n<p>a way up the stones. The cloud hid the moon,</p>\n<p>and as Mowgli wondered what would come next he heard</p>\n<p>Bagheera’s light feet on the terrace. The Black Panther had</p>\n<p>raced up the slope almost without a sound and was</p>\n<p>striking--he knew better than to waste time in biting--right and</p>",
        "<p>left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli in</p>\n<p>circles fifty and sixty deep. There was a howl of</p>\n<p>fright and rage, and then as Bagheera tripped on the</p>\n<p>rolling kicking bodies beneath him, a monkey shouted: “There is</p>\n<p>only one here! Kill him! Kill.” A scuffling mass of</p>\n<p>monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over Bagheera, while</p>\n<p>five or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him up</p>",
        "<p>the wall of the summerhouse and pushed him through the</p>\n<p>hole of the broken dome. A man-trained boy would have</p>\n<p>been badly bruised, for the fall was a good fifteen</p>\n<p>feet, but Mowgli fell as Baloo had taught him to</p>\n<p>fall, and landed on his feet. “Stay there,” shouted the</p>\n<p>monkeys, “till we have killed thy friends, and later we</p>\n<p>will play with thee--if the Poison-People leave thee alive.” “We</p>",
        "<p>be of one blood, ye and I,” said Mowgli, quickly</p>\n<p>giving the Snake’s Call. He could hear rustling and hissing</p>\n<p>in the rubbish all round him and gave the Call</p>\n<p>a second time, to make sure. “Even ssso! Down hoods</p>\n<p>all!” said half a dozen low voices (every ruin in</p>\n<p>India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes,</p>\n<p>and the old summerhouse was alive with cobras). “Stand still,</p>",
        "<p>Little Brother, for thy feet may do us harm.” Mowgli</p>\n<p>stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open</p>\n<p>work and listening to the furious din of the fight</p>\n<p>round the Black Panther--the yells and chatterings and scufflings, and</p>\n<p>Bagheera’s deep, hoarse cough as he backed and bucked and</p>\n<p>twisted and plunged under the heaps of his enemies. For</p>\n<p>the first time since he was born, Bagheera was fighting</p>",
        "<p>for his life. “Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would</p>\n<p>not have come alone,” Mowgli thought. And then he called</p>\n<p>aloud: “To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the water tanks.</p>\n<p>Roll and plunge! Get to the water!” Bagheera heard, and</p>\n<p>the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave him</p>\n<p>new courage. He worked his way desperately, inch by inch,</p>\n<p>straight for the reservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the</p>",
        "<p>ruined wall nearest the jungle rose up the rumbling war-shout</p>\n<p>of Baloo. The old Bear had done his best, but</p>\n<p>he could not come before. “Bagheera,” he shouted, “I am</p>\n<p>here. I climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip under</p>\n<p>my feet! Wait my coming, O most infamous Bandar-log!” He</p>\n<p>panted up the terrace only to disappear to the head</p>\n<p>in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself squarely</p>",
        "<p>on his haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws, hugged as</p>\n<p>many as he could hold, and then began to hit</p>\n<p>with a regular bat-bat-bat, like the flipping strokes of a</p>\n<p>paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told Mowgli that</p>\n<p>Bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the</p>\n<p>monkeys could not follow. The Panther lay gasping for breath,</p>\n<p>his head just out of the water, while the monkeys</p>",
        "<p>stood three deep on the red steps, dancing up and</p>\n<p>down with rage, ready to spring upon him from all</p>\n<p>sides if he came out to help Baloo. It was</p>\n<p>then that Bagheera lifted up his dripping chin, and in</p>\n<p>despair gave the Snake’s Call for protection--“We be of one</p>\n<p>blood, ye and I”--for he believed that Kaa had turned</p>\n<p>tail at the last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered under</p>",
        "<p>the monkeys on the edge of the terrace, could not</p>\n<p>help chuckling as he heard the Black Panther asking for</p>\n<p>help. Kaa had only just worked his way over the</p>\n<p>west wall, landing with a wrench that dislodged a coping</p>\n<p>stone into the ditch. He had no intention of losing</p>\n<p>any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself</p>\n<p>once or twice, to be sure that every foot of</p>",
        "<p>his long body was in working order. All that while</p>\n<p>the fight with Baloo went on, and the monkeys yelled</p>\n<p>in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying</p>\n<p>to and fro, carried the news of the great battle</p>\n<p>over the jungle, till even Hathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted,</p>\n<p>and, far away, scattered bands of the Monkey-Folk woke and</p>\n<p>came leaping along the tree-roads to help their comrades in</p>",
        "<p>the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused</p>\n<p>all the day birds for miles round. Then Kaa came</p>\n<p>straight, quickly, and anxious to kill. The fighting strength of</p>\n<p>a python is in the driving blow of his head</p>\n<p>backed by all the strength and weight of his body.</p>\n<p>If you can imagine a lance, or a battering ram,</p>\n<p>or a hammer weighing nearly half a ton driven by</p>",
        "<p>a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it,</p>\n<p>you can roughly imagine what Kaa was like when he</p>\n<p>fought. A python four or five feet long can knock</p>\n<p>a man down if he hits him fairly in the</p>\n<p>chest, and Kaa was thirty feet long, as you know.</p>\n<p>His first stroke was delivered into the heart of the</p>\n<p>crowd round Baloo. It was sent home with shut mouth</p>",
        "<p>in silence, and there was no need of a second.</p>\n<p>The monkeys scattered with cries of--“Kaa! It is Kaa! Run!</p>\n<p>Run!” Generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior</p>\n<p>by the stories their elders told them of Kaa, the</p>\n<p>night thief, who could slip along the branches as quietly</p>\n<p>as moss grows, and steal away the strongest monkey that</p>\n<p>ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look</p>",
        "<p>so like a dead branch or a rotten stump that</p>\n<p>the wisest were deceived, till the branch caught them. Kaa</p>\n<p>was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle, for</p>\n<p>none of them knew the limits of his power, none</p>\n<p>of them could look him in the face, and none</p>\n<p>had ever come alive out of his hug. And so</p>\n<p>they ran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the</p>",
        "<p>roofs of the houses, and Baloo drew a deep breath</p>\n<p>of relief. His fur was much thicker than Bagheera’s, but</p>\n<p>he had suffered sorely in the fight. Then Kaa opened</p>\n<p>his mouth for the first time and spoke one long</p>\n<p>hissing word, and the far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense</p>\n<p>of the Cold Lairs, stayed where they were, cowering, till</p>\n<p>the loaded branches bent and crackled under them. The monkeys</p>",
        "<p>on the walls and the empty houses stopped their cries,</p>\n<p>and in the stillness that fell upon the city Mowgli</p>\n<p>heard Bagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up</p>\n<p>from the tank. Then the clamor broke out again. The</p>\n<p>monkeys leaped higher up the walls. They clung around the</p>\n<p>necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they</p>\n<p>skipped along the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse,</p>",
        "<p>put his eye to the screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between</p>\n<p>his front teeth, to show his derision and contempt. “Get</p>\n<p>the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no</p>\n<p>more,” Bagheera gasped. “Let us take the man-cub and go.</p>\n<p>They may attack again.” “They will not move till I</p>\n<p>order them. Stay you sssso!” Kaa hissed, and the city</p>\n<p>was silent once more. “I could not come before, Brother,</p>",
        "<p>but I think I heard thee call”--this was to Bagheera.</p>\n<p>“I--I may have cried out in the battle,” Bagheera answered.</p>\n<p>“Baloo, art thou hurt? “I am not sure that they</p>\n<p>did not pull me into a hundred little bearlings,” said</p>\n<p>Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other. “Wow! I</p>\n<p>am sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera</p>\n<p>and I.” “No matter. Where is the manling?” “Here, in</p>",
        "<p>a trap. I cannot climb out,” cried Mowgli. The curve</p>\n<p>of the broken dome was above his head. “Take him</p>\n<p>away. He dances like Mao the Peacock. He will crush</p>\n<p>our young,” said the cobras inside. “Hah!” said Kaa with</p>\n<p>a chuckle, “he has friends everywhere, this manling. Stand back,</p>\n<p>manling. And hide you, O Poison People. I break down</p>\n<p>the wall.” Kaa looked carefully till he found a discolored</p>",
        "<p>crack in the marble tracery showing a weak spot, made</p>\n<p>two or three light taps with his head to get</p>\n<p>the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his</p>\n<p>body clear of the ground, sent home half a dozen</p>\n<p>full-power smashing blows, nose-first. The screen-work broke and fell away</p>\n<p>in a cloud of dust and rubbish, and Mowgli leaped</p>\n<p>through the opening and flung himself between Baloo and Bagheera--an</p>",
        "<p>arm around each big neck. “Art thou hurt?” said Baloo,</p>\n<p>hugging him softly. “I am sore, hungry, and not a</p>\n<p>little bruised. But, oh, they have handled ye grievously, my</p>\n<p>Brothers! Ye bleed.” “Others also,” said Bagheera, licking his lips</p>\n<p>and looking at the monkey-dead on the terrace and round</p>\n<p>the tank. “It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou</p>\n<p>art safe, oh, my pride of all little frogs!” whimpered</p>",
        "<p>Baloo. “Of that we shall judge later,” said Bagheera, in</p>\n<p>a dry voice that Mowgli did not at all like.</p>\n<p>“But here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle</p>\n<p>and thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our</p>\n<p>customs, Mowgli.” Mowgli turned and saw the great Python’s head</p>\n<p>swaying a foot above his own. “So this is the</p>\n<p>manling,” said Kaa. “Very soft is his skin, and he</p>",
        "<p>is not unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that</p>\n<p>I do not mistake thee for a monkey some twilight</p>\n<p>when I have newly changed my coat.” “We be one</p>\n<p>blood, thou and I,” Mowgli answered. “I take my life</p>\n<p>from thee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if</p>\n<p>ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.” “All thanks, Little Brother,”</p>\n<p>said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. “And what may so</p>",
        "<p>bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow</p>\n<p>when next he goes abroad.” “I kill nothing,--I am too</p>\n<p>little,--but I drive goats toward such as can use them.</p>\n<p>When thou art empty come to me and see if</p>\n<p>I speak the truth. I have some skill in these</p>\n<p>[he held out his hands], and if ever thou art</p>\n<p>in a trap, I may pay the debt which I</p>",
        "<p>owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to Baloo, here. Good</p>\n<p>hunting to ye all, my masters.” “Well said,” growled Baloo,</p>\n<p>for Mowgli had returned thanks very prettily. The Python dropped</p>\n<p>his head lightly for a minute on Mowgli’s shoulder. “A</p>\n<p>brave heart and a courteous tongue,” said he. “They shall</p>\n<p>carry thee far through the jungle, manling. But now go</p>\n<p>hence quickly with thy friends. Go and sleep, for the</p>",
        "<p>moon sets, and what follows it is not well that</p>\n<p>thou shouldst see.” The moon was sinking behind the hills</p>\n<p>and the lines of trembling monkeys huddled together on the</p>\n<p>walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky fringes of things.</p>\n<p>Baloo went down to the tank for a drink and</p>\n<p>Bagheera began to put his fur in order, as Kaa</p>\n<p>glided out into the center of the terrace and brought</p>",
        "<p>his jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all</p>\n<p>the monkeys’ eyes upon him. “The moon sets,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Is there yet light enough to see?” From the walls</p>\n<p>came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops--“We see,</p>\n<p>O Kaa.” “Good. Begins now the dance--the Dance of the</p>\n<p>Hunger of Kaa. Sit still and watch.” He turned twice</p>\n<p>or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head from</p>",
        "<p>right to left. Then he began making loops and figures</p>\n<p>of eight with his body, and soft, oozy triangles that</p>\n<p>melted into squares and five-sided figures, and coiled mounds, never</p>\n<p>resting, never hurrying, and never stopping his low humming song.</p>\n<p>It grew darker and darker, till at last the dragging,</p>\n<p>shifting coils disappeared, but they could hear the rustle of</p>\n<p>the scales. Baloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling</p>",
        "<p>in their throats, their neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched</p>\n<p>and wondered. “Bandar-log,” said the voice of Kaa at last,</p>\n<p>“can ye stir foot or hand without my order? Speak!”</p>\n<p>“Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O</p>\n<p>Kaa!” “Good! Come all one pace nearer to me.” The</p>\n<p>lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and</p>\n<p>Bagheera took one stiff step forward with them. “Nearer!” hissed</p>",
        "<p>Kaa, and they all moved again. Mowgli laid his hands</p>\n<p>on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the</p>\n<p>two great beasts started as though they had been waked</p>\n<p>from a dream. “Keep thy hand on my shoulder,” Bagheera</p>\n<p>whispered. “Keep it there, or I must go back--must go</p>\n<p>back to Kaa. Aah!” “It is only old Kaa making</p>\n<p>circles on the dust,” said Mowgli. “Let us go.” And</p>",
        "<p>the three slipped off through a gap in the walls</p>\n<p>to the jungle. “Whoof!” said Baloo, when he stood under</p>\n<p>the still trees again. “Never more will I make an</p>\n<p>ally of Kaa,” and he shook himself all over. “He</p>\n<p>knows more than we,” said Bagheera, trembling. “In a little</p>\n<p>time, had I stayed, I should have walked down his</p>\n<p>throat.” “Many will walk by that road before the moon</p>",
        "<p>rises again,” said Baloo. “He will have good hunting--after his</p>\n<p>own fashion.” “But what was the meaning of it all?”</p>\n<p>said Mowgli, who did not know anything of a python’s</p>\n<p>powers of fascination. “I saw no more than a big</p>\n<p>snake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his</p>\n<p>nose was all sore. Ho! Ho!” “Mowgli,” said Bagheera angrily,</p>\n<p>“his nose was sore on thy account, as my ears</p>",
        "<p>and sides and paws, and Baloo’s neck and shoulders are</p>\n<p>bitten on thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be</p>\n<p>able to hunt with pleasure for many days.” “It is</p>\n<p>nothing,” said Baloo; “we have the man-cub again.” “True, but</p>\n<p>he has cost us heavily in time which might have</p>\n<p>been spent in good hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am</p>\n<p>half plucked along my back--and last of all, in honor.</p>",
        "<p>For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black Panther, was</p>\n<p>forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and</p>\n<p>I were both made stupid as little birds by the</p>\n<p>Hunger Dance. All this, man-cub, came of thy playing with</p>\n<p>the Bandar-log.” “True, it is true,” said Mowgli sorrowfully. “I</p>\n<p>am an evil man-cub, and my stomach is sad in</p>\n<p>me.” “Mf! What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?”</p>",
        "<p>Baloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more</p>\n<p>trouble, but he could not tamper with the Law, so</p>\n<p>he mumbled: “Sorrow never stays punishment. But remember, Bagheera, he</p>\n<p>is very little.” “I will remember. But he has done</p>\n<p>mischief, and blows must be dealt now. Mowgli, hast thou</p>\n<p>anything to say?” “Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou</p>\n<p>are wounded. It is just.” Bagheera gave him half a</p>",
        "<p>dozen love-taps from a panther’s point of view (they would</p>\n<p>hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for</p>\n<p>a seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating</p>\n<p>as you could wish to avoid. When it was all</p>\n<p>over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself up without a word.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Bagheera, “jump on my back, Little Brother, and</p>\n<p>we will go home.” One of the beauties of Jungle</p>",
        "<p>Law is that punishment settles all scores. There is no</p>\n<p>nagging afterward. Mowgli laid his head down on Bagheera’s back</p>\n<p>and slept so deeply that he never waked when he</p>\n<p>was put down in the home-cave. Road-Song of the Bandar-Log</p>\n<p>Here we go in a flung festoon, Half-way up to</p>\n<p>the jealous moon! Don’t you envy our pranceful bands? Don’t</p>\n<p>you wish you had extra hands? Wouldn’t you like if</p>",
        "<p>your tails were--so-- Curved in the shape of a Cupid’s</p>\n<p>bow? Now you’re angry, but--never mind, _Brother, thy tail hangs</p>\n<p>down behind!_ Here we sit in a branchy row, Thinking</p>\n<p>of beautiful things we know; Dreaming of deeds that we</p>\n<p>mean to do, All complete, in a minute or two--</p>\n<p>Something noble and wise and good, Done by merely wishing</p>\n<p>we could.

        "<p>That rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape</p>\n<p>swings. By the rubbish in our wake, and the noble</p>\n<p>noise we make, Be sure, be sure, we’re going to</p>\n<p>do some splendid things!_</p>"

        "<h3>“Tiger! Tiger!”</h3>\n<p>What of the hunting, hunter bold? Brother, the watch was</p>\n<p>long and cold. What of the quarry ye went to</p>\n<p>kill? Brother, he crops in the jungle still. Where is</p>\n<p>the power that made your pride? Brother, it ebbs from</p>\n<p>my flank and side. Where is the haste that ye</p>\n<p>hurry by? Brother, I go to my lair--to die. Now</p>\n<p>we must go back to the first tale. When Mowgli</p>",
        "<p>left the wolf’s cave after the fight with the Pack</p>\n<p>at the Council Rock, he went down to the plowed</p>\n<p>lands where the villagers lived, but he would not stop</p>\n<p>there because it was too near to the jungle, and</p>\n<p>he knew that he had made at least one bad</p>\n<p>enemy at the Council. So he hurried on, keeping to</p>\n<p>the rough road that ran down the valley, and followed</p>",
        "<p>it at a steady jog-trot for nearly twenty miles, till</p>\n<p>he came to a country that he did not know.</p>\n<p>The valley opened out into a great plain dotted over</p>\n<p>with rocks and cut up by ravines. At one end</p>\n<p>stood a little village, and at the other the thick</p>\n<p>jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds, and</p>\n<p>stopped there as though it had been cut off with</p>",
        "<p>a hoe. All over the plain, cattle and buffaloes were</p>\n<p>grazing, and when the little boys in charge of the</p>\n<p>herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the</p>\n<p>yellow pariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked.</p>\n<p>Mowgli walked on, for he was feeling hungry, and when</p>\n<p>he came to the village gate he saw the big</p>\n<p>thorn-bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight,</p>",
        "<p>pushed to one side. “Umph!” he said, for he had</p>\n<p>come across more than one such barricade in his night</p>\n<p>rambles after things to eat. “So men are afraid of</p>\n<p>the People of the Jungle here also.” He sat down</p>\n<p>by the gate, and when a man came out he</p>\n<p>stood up, opened his mouth, and pointed down it to</p>\n<p>show that he wanted food. The man stared, and ran</p>",
        "<p>back up the one street of the village shouting for</p>\n<p>the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in</p>\n<p>white, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead.</p>\n<p>The priest came to the gate, and with him at</p>\n<p>least a hundred people, who stared and talked and shouted</p>\n<p>and pointed at Mowgli. “They have no manners, these Men</p>\n<p>Folk,” said Mowgli to himself. “Only the gray ape would</p>",
        "<p>behave as they do.” So he threw back his long</p>\n<p>hair and frowned at the crowd. “What is there to</p>\n<p>be afraid of?” said the priest. “Look at the marks</p>\n<p>on his arms and legs. They are the bites of</p>\n<p>wolves. He is but a wolf-child run away from the</p>\n<p>jungle.” Of course, in playing together, the cubs had often</p>\n<p>nipped Mowgli harder than they intended, and there were white</p>",
        "<p>scars all over his arms and legs. But he would</p>\n<p>have been the last person in the world to call</p>\n<p>these bites, for he knew what real biting meant. “Arre!</p>\n<p>Arre!” said two or three women together. “To be bitten</p>\n<p>by wolves, poor child! He is a handsome boy. He</p>\n<p>has eyes like red fire. By my honor, Messua, he</p>\n<p>is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the</p>",
        "<p>tiger.” “Let me look,” said a woman with heavy copper</p>\n<p>rings on her wrists and ankles, and she peered at</p>\n<p>Mowgli under the palm of her hand. “Indeed he is</p>\n<p>not. He is thinner, but he has the very look</p>\n<p>of my boy.” The priest was a clever man, and</p>\n<p>he knew that Messua was wife to the richest villager</p>\n<p>in the place. So he looked up at the sky</p>",
        "<p>for a minute and said solemnly: “What the jungle has</p>\n<p>taken the jungle has restored. Take the boy into thy</p>\n<p>house, my sister, and forget not to honor the priest</p>\n<p>who sees so far into the lives of men.” “By</p>\n<p>the Bull that bought me,” said Mowgli to himself, “but</p>\n<p>all this talking is like another looking-over by the Pack!</p>\n<p>Well, if I am a man, a man I must</p>",
        "<p>become.” The crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to</p>\n<p>her hut, where there was a red lacquered bedstead, a</p>\n<p>great earthen grain chest with funny raised patterns on it,</p>\n<p>half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a</p>\n<p>Hindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall</p>\n<p>a real looking glass, such as they sell at the</p>\n<p>country fairs. She gave him a long drink of milk</p>",
        "<p>and some bread, and then she laid her hand on</p>\n<p>his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought</p>\n<p>perhaps that he might be her real son come back</p>\n<p>from the jungle where the tiger had taken him. So</p>\n<p>she said, “Nathoo, O Nathoo!” Mowgli did not show that</p>\n<p>he knew the name. “Dost thou not remember the day</p>\n<p>when I gave thee thy new shoes?” She touched his</p>",
        "<p>foot, and it was almost as hard as horn. “No,”</p>\n<p>she said sorrowfully, “those feet have never worn shoes, but</p>\n<p>thou art very like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be</p>\n<p>my son.” Mowgli was uneasy, because he had never been</p>\n<p>under a roof before. But as he looked at the</p>\n<p>thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any</p>\n<p>time if he wanted to get away, and that the</p>",
        "<p>window had no fastenings. “What is the good of a</p>\n<p>man,” he said to himself at last, “if he does</p>\n<p>not understand man’s talk? Now I am as silly and</p>\n<p>dumb as a man would be with us in the</p>\n<p>jungle. I must speak their talk.” It was not for</p>\n<p>fun that he had learned while he was with the</p>\n<p>wolves to imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle</p>",
        "<p>and the grunt of the little wild pig. So, as</p>\n<p>soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate it</p>\n<p>almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the names</p>\n<p>of many things in the hut. There was a difficulty</p>\n<p>at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under anything that</p>\n<p>looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and</p>\n<p>when they shut the door he went through the window.</p>",
        "<p>“Give him his will,” said Messua’s husband. “Remember he can</p>\n<p>never till now have slept on a bed. If he</p>\n<p>is indeed sent in the place of our son he</p>\n<p>will not run away.” So Mowgli stretched himself in some</p>\n<p>long, clean grass at the edge of the field, but</p>\n<p>before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose</p>\n<p>poked him under the chin. “Phew!” said Gray Brother (he</p>",
        "<p>was the eldest of Mother Wolf’s cubs). “This is a</p>\n<p>poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest of</p>\n<p>wood smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already. Wake, Little</p>\n<p>Brother; I bring news.” “Are all well in the jungle?”</p>\n<p>said Mowgli, hugging him. “All except the wolves that were</p>\n<p>burned with the Red Flower. Now, listen. Shere Khan has</p>\n<p>gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows</p>",
        "<p>again, for he is badly singed. When he returns he</p>\n<p>swears that he will lay thy bones in the Waingunga.”</p>\n<p>“There are two words to that. I also have made</p>\n<p>a little promise. But news is always good. I am</p>\n<p>tired to-night,--very tired with new things, Gray Brother,--but bring me</p>\n<p>the news always.” “Thou wilt not forget that thou art</p>\n<p>a wolf? Men will not make thee forget?” said Gray</p>",
        "<p>Brother anxiously. “Never. I will always remember that I love</p>\n<p>thee and all in our cave. But also I will</p>\n<p>always remember that I have been cast out of the</p>\n<p>Pack.” “And that thou mayest be cast out of another</p>\n<p>pack. Men are only men, Little Brother, and their talk</p>\n<p>is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When</p>\n<p>I come down here again, I will wait for thee</p>",
        "<p>in the bamboos at the edge of the grazing-ground.” For</p>\n<p>three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the</p>\n<p>village gate, he was so busy learning the ways and</p>\n<p>customs of men. First he had to wear a cloth</p>\n<p>round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had</p>\n<p>to learn about money, which he did not in the</p>\n<p>least understand, and about plowing, of which he did not</p>",
        "<p>see the use. Then the little children in the village</p>\n<p>made him very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle</p>\n<p>had taught him to keep his temper, for in the</p>\n<p>jungle life and food depend on keeping your temper; but</p>\n<p>when they made fun of him because he would not</p>\n<p>play games or fly kites, or because he mispronounced some</p>\n<p>word, only the knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill</p>",
        "<p>little naked cubs kept him from picking them up and</p>\n<p>breaking them in two. He did not know his own</p>\n<p>strength in the least. In the jungle he knew he</p>\n<p>was weak compared with the beasts, but in the village</p>\n<p>people said that he was as strong as a bull.</p>\n<p>And Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference</p>\n<p>that caste makes between man and man. When the potter’s</p>",
        "<p>donkey slipped in the clay pit, Mowgli hauled it out</p>\n<p>by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for</p>\n<p>their journey to the market at Khanhiwara. That was very</p>\n<p>shocking, too, for the potter is a low-caste man, and</p>\n<p>his donkey is worse. When the priest scolded him, Mowgli</p>\n<p>threatened to put him on the donkey too, and the</p>\n<p>priest told Messua’s husband that Mowgli had better be set</p>",
        "<p>to work as soon as possible; and the village head-man</p>\n<p>told Mowgli that he would have to go out with</p>\n<p>the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they grazed.</p>\n<p>No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night,</p>\n<p>because he had been appointed a servant of the village,</p>\n<p>as it were, he went off to a circle that</p>\n<p>met every evening on a masonry platform under a great</p>",
        "<p>fig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and</p>\n<p>the watchman and the barber, who knew all the gossip</p>\n<p>of the village, and old Buldeo, the village hunter, who</p>\n<p>had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys sat</p>\n<p>and talked in the upper branches, and there was a</p>\n<p>hole under the platform where a cobra lived, and he</p>\n<p>had his little platter of milk every night because he</p>",
        "<p>was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree</p>\n<p>and talked, and pulled at the big huqas (the water-pipes)</p>\n<p>till far into the night. They told wonderful tales of</p>\n<p>gods and men and ghosts; and Buldeo told even more</p>\n<p>wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the jungle,</p>\n<p>till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle</p>\n<p>bulged out of their heads. Most of the tales were</p>",
        "<p>about animals, for the jungle was always at their door.</p>\n<p>The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops,</p>\n<p>and now and again the tiger carried off a man</p>\n<p>at twilight, within sight of the village gates. Mowgli, who</p>\n<p>naturally knew something about what they were talking of, had</p>\n<p>to cover his face not to show that he was</p>\n<p>laughing, while Buldeo, the Tower musket across his knees, climbed</p>",
        "<p>on from one wonderful story to another, and Mowgli’s shoulders</p>\n<p>shook. Buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried</p>\n<p>away Messua’s son was a ghost-tiger, and his body was</p>\n<p>inhabited by the ghost of a wicked, old money-lender, who</p>\n<p>had died some years ago. “And I know that this</p>\n<p>is true,” he said, “because Purun Dass always limped from</p>\n<p>the blow that he got in a riot when his</p>",
        "<p>account books were burned, and the tiger that I speak</p>\n<p>of he limps, too, for the tracks of his pads</p>\n<p>are unequal.” “True, true, that must be the truth,” said</p>\n<p>the gray-beards, nodding together. “Are all these tales such cobwebs</p>\n<p>and moontalk?” said Mowgli. “That tiger limps because he was</p>\n<p>born lame, as everyone knows. To talk of the soul</p>\n<p>of a money-lender in a beast that never had the</p>",
        "<p>courage of a jackal is child’s talk.” Buldeo was speechless</p>\n<p>with surprise for a moment, and the head-man stared. “Oho!</p>\n<p>It is the jungle brat, is it?” said Buldeo. “If</p>\n<p>thou art so wise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara,</p>\n<p>for the Government has set a hundred rupees on his</p>\n<p>life. Better still, talk not when thy elders speak.” Mowgli</p>\n<p>rose to go. “All the evening I have lain here</p>",
        "<p>listening,” he called back over his shoulder, “and, except once</p>\n<p>or twice, Buldeo has not said one word of truth</p>\n<p>concerning the jungle, which is at his very doors. How,</p>\n<p>then, shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods</p>\n<p>and goblins which he says he has seen?” “It is</p>\n<p>full time that boy went to herding,” said the head-man,</p>\n<p>while Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli’s impertinence. The custom</p>",
        "<p>of most Indian villages is for a few boys to</p>\n<p>take the cattle and buffaloes out to graze in the</p>\n<p>early morning, and bring them back at night. The very</p>\n<p>cattle that would trample a white man to death allow</p>\n<p>themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by</p>\n<p>children that hardly come up to their noses. So long</p>\n<p>as the boys keep with the herds they are safe,</p>",
        "<p>for not even the tiger will charge a mob of</p>\n<p>cattle. But if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt</p>\n<p>lizards, they are sometimes carried off. Mowgli went through the</p>\n<p>village street in the dawn, sitting on the back of</p>\n<p>Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes, with their</p>\n<p>long, backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their byres,</p>\n<p>one by one, and followed him, and Mowgli made it</p>",
        "<p>very clear to the children with him that he was</p>\n<p>the master. He beat the buffaloes with a long, polished</p>\n<p>bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze</p>\n<p>the cattle by themselves, while he went on with the</p>\n<p>buffaloes, and to be very careful not to stray away</p>\n<p>from the herd. An Indian grazing ground is all rocks</p>\n<p>and scrub and tussocks and little ravines, among which the</p>",
        "<p>herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes generally keep to the</p>\n<p>pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing or basking</p>\n<p>in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on</p>\n<p>to the edge of the plain where the Waingunga came</p>\n<p>out of the jungle; then he dropped from Rama’s neck,</p>\n<p>trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said Gray Brother, “I have waited here very many</p>",
        "<p>days. What is the meaning of this cattle-herding work?” “It</p>\n<p>is an order,” said Mowgli. “I am a village herd</p>\n<p>for a while. What news of Shere Khan?” “He has</p>\n<p>come back to this country, and has waited here a</p>\n<p>long time for thee. Now he has gone off again,</p>\n<p>for the game is scarce. But he means to kill</p>\n<p>thee.” “Very good,” said Mowgli. “So long as he is</p>",
        "<p>away do thou or one of the four brothers sit</p>\n<p>on that rock, so that I can see thee as</p>\n<p>I come out of the village. When he comes back</p>\n<p>wait for me in the ravine by the _dhâk_ tree</p>\n<p>in the center of the plain. We need not walk</p>\n<p>into Shere Khan’s mouth.” Then Mowgli picked out a shady</p>\n<p>place, and lay down and slept while the buffaloes grazed</p>",
        "<p>round him. Herding in India is one of the laziest</p>\n<p>things in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and</p>\n<p>lie down, and move on again, and they do not</p>\n<p>even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes very seldom</p>\n<p>say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one</p>\n<p>after another, and work their way into the mud till</p>\n<p>only their noses and staring china-blue eyes show above the</p>",
        "<p>surface, and then they lie like logs. The sun makes</p>\n<p>the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children</p>\n<p>hear one kite (never any more) whistling almost out of</p>\n<p>sight overhead, and they know that if they died, or</p>\n<p>a cow died, that kite would sweep down, and the</p>\n<p>next kite miles away would see him drop and follow,</p>\n<p>and the next, and the next, and almost before they</p>",
        "<p>were dead there would be a score of hungry kites</p>\n<p>come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and wake and</p>\n<p>sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and</p>\n<p>put grasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and</p>\n<p>make them fight; or string a necklace of red and</p>\n<p>black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard basking on a</p>\n<p>rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows.</p>",
        "<p>Then they sing long, long songs with odd native quavers</p>\n<p>at the end of them, and the day seems longer</p>\n<p>than most people’s whole lives, and perhaps they make a</p>\n<p>mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and</p>\n<p>buffaloes, and put reeds into the men’s hands, and pretend</p>\n<p>that they are kings and the figures are their armies,</p>\n<p>or that they are gods to be worshiped. Then evening</p>",
        "<p>comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up</p>\n<p>out of the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going</p>\n<p>off one after the other, and they all string across</p>\n<p>the gray plain back to the twinkling village lights. Day</p>\n<p>after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their</p>\n<p>wallows, and day after day he would see Gray Brother’s</p>\n<p>back a mile and a half away across the plain</p>",
        "<p>(so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back),</p>\n<p>and day after day he would lie on the grass</p>\n<p>listening to the noises round him, and dreaming of old</p>\n<p>days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a</p>\n<p>false step with his lame paw up in the jungles</p>\n<p>by the Waingunga, Mowgli would have heard him in those</p>\n<p>long, still mornings. At last a day came when he</p>",
        "<p>did not see Gray Brother at the signal place, and</p>\n<p>he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by</p>\n<p>the dhk tree, which was all covered with golden-red flowers.</p>\n<p>There sat Gray Brother, every bristle on his back lifted.</p>\n<p>“He has hidden for a month to throw thee off</p>\n<p>thy guard. He crossed the ranges last night with Tabaqui,</p>\n<p>hot-foot on thy trail,” said the Wolf, panting. Mowgli frowned.</p>",
        "<p>“I am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is</p>\n<p>very cunning.” “Have no fear,” said Gray Brother, licking his</p>\n<p>lips a little. “I met Tabaqui in the dawn. Now</p>\n<p>he is telling all his wisdom to the kites, but</p>\n<p>he told me everything before I broke his back. Shere</p>\n<p>Khan’s plan is to wait for thee at the village</p>\n<p>gate this evening--for thee and for no one else. He</p>",
        "<p>is lying up now, in the big dry ravine of</p>\n<p>the Waingunga.” “Has he eaten today, or does he hunt</p>\n<p>empty?” said Mowgli, for the answer meant life and death</p>\n<p>to him. “He killed at dawn,--a pig,--and he has drunk</p>\n<p>too. Remember, Shere Khan could never fast, even for the</p>\n<p>sake of revenge.” “Oh! Fool, fool! What a cub’s cub</p>\n<p>it is! Eaten and drunk too, and he thinks that</p>",
        "<p>I shall wait till he has slept! Now, where does</p>\n<p>he lie up? If there were but ten of us</p>\n<p>we might pull him down as he lies. These buffaloes</p>\n<p>will not charge unless they wind him, and I cannot</p>\n<p>speak their language. Can we get behind his track so</p>\n<p>that they may smell it?” “He swam far down the</p>\n<p>Waingunga to cut that off,” said Gray Brother. “Tabaqui told</p>",
        "<p>him that, I know. He would never have thought of</p>\n<p>it alone.” Mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth,</p>\n<p>thinking. “The big ravine of the Waingunga. That opens out</p>\n<p>on the plain not half a mile from here. I</p>\n<p>can take the herd round through the jungle to the</p>\n<p>head of the ravine and then sweep down--but he would</p>\n<p>slink out at the foot. We must block that end.</p>",
        "<p>Gray Brother, canst thou cut the herd in two for</p>\n<p>me?” “Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.”</p>\n<p>Gray Brother trotted off and dropped into a hole. Then</p>\n<p>there lifted up a huge gray head that Mowgli knew</p>\n<p>well, and the hot air was filled with the most</p>\n<p>desolate cry of all the jungle--the hunting howl of a</p>\n<p>wolf at midday. “Akela! Akela!” said Mowgli, clapping his hands.</p>",
        "<p>“I might have known that thou wouldst not forget me.</p>\n<p>We have a big work in hand. Cut the herd</p>\n<p>in two, Akela. Keep the cows and calves together, and</p>\n<p>the bulls and the plow buffaloes by themselves.” The two</p>\n<p>wolves ran, ladies’-chain fashion, in and out of the herd,</p>\n<p>which snorted and threw up its head, and separated into</p>\n<p>two clumps. In one, the cow-buffaloes stood with their calves</p>",
        "<p>in the center, and glared and pawed, ready, if a</p>\n<p>wolf would only stay still, to charge down and trample</p>\n<p>the life out of him. In the other, the bulls</p>\n<p>and the young bulls snorted and stamped, but though they</p>\n<p>looked more imposing they were much less dangerous, for they</p>\n<p>had no calves to protect. No six men could have</p>\n<p>divided the herd so neatly. “What orders!” panted Akela. “They</p>",
        "<p>are trying to join again.” Mowgli slipped on to Rama’s</p>\n<p>back. “Drive the bulls away to the left, Akela. Gray</p>\n<p>Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and</p>\n<p>drive them into the foot of the ravine.” “How far?”</p>\n<p>said Gray Brother, panting and snapping. “Till the sides are</p>\n<p>higher than Shere Khan can jump,” shouted Mowgli. “Keep them</p>\n<p>there till we come down.” The bulls swept off as</p>",
        "<p>Akela bayed, and Gray Brother stopped in front of the</p>\n<p>cows. They charged down on him, and he ran just</p>\n<p>before them to the foot of the ravine, as Akela</p>\n<p>drove the bulls far to the left. “Well done! Another</p>\n<p>charge and they are fairly started. Careful, now--careful, Akela. A</p>\n<p>snap too much and the bulls will charge. Hujah! This</p>\n<p>is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou think these</p>",
        "<p>creatures could move so swiftly?” Mowgli called. “I have--have hunted</p>\n<p>these too in my time,” gasped Akela in the dust.</p>\n<p>“Shall I turn them into the jungle?” “Ay! Turn. Swiftly</p>\n<p>turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I</p>\n<p>could only tell him what I need of him to-day.”</p>\n<p>The bulls were turned, to the right this time, and</p>\n<p>crashed into the standing thicket. The other herd children, watching</p>",
        "<p>with the cattle half a mile away, hurried to the</p>\n<p>village as fast as their legs could carry them, crying</p>\n<p>that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away. But</p>\n<p>Mowgli’s plan was simple enough. All he wanted to do</p>\n<p>was to make a big circle uphill and get at</p>\n<p>the head of the ravine, and then take the bulls</p>\n<p>down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and</p>",
        "<p>the cows; for he knew that after a meal and</p>\n<p>a full drink Shere Khan would not be in any</p>\n<p>condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of</p>\n<p>the ravine. He was soothing the buffaloes now by voice,</p>\n<p>and Akela had dropped far to the rear, only whimpering</p>\n<p>once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a</p>\n<p>long, long circle, for they did not wish to get</p>",
        "<p>too near the ravine and give Shere Khan warning. At</p>\n<p>last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd at the head</p>\n<p>of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply</p>\n<p>down to the ravine itself. From that height you could</p>\n<p>see across the tops of the trees down to the</p>\n<p>plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides</p>\n<p>of the ravine, and he saw with a great deal</p>",
        "<p>of satisfaction that they ran nearly straight up and down,</p>\n<p>while the vines and creepers that hung over them would</p>\n<p>give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get</p>\n<p>out. “Let them breathe, Akela,” he said, holding up his</p>\n<p>hand. “They have not winded him yet. Let them breathe.</p>\n<p>I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We have him</p>\n<p>in the trap.” He put his hands to his mouth</p>",
        "<p>and shouted down the ravine--it was almost like shouting down</p>\n<p>a tunnel--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock. After</p>\n<p>a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl</p>\n<p>of a full-fed tiger just wakened. “Who calls?” said Shere</p>\n<p>Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of the</p>\n<p>ravine screeching. “I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to</p>\n<p>come to the Council Rock! Down--hurry them down, Akela! Down,</p>",
        "<p>Rama, down!” The herd paused for an instant at the</p>\n<p>edge of the slope, but Akela gave tongue in the</p>\n<p>full hunting-yell, and they pitched over one after the other,</p>\n<p>just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting</p>\n<p>up round them. Once started, there was no chance of</p>\n<p>stopping, and before they were fairly in the bed of</p>\n<p>the ravine Rama winded Shere Khan and bellowed. “Ha! Ha!”</p>",
        "<p>said Mowgli, on his back. “Now thou knowest!” and the</p>\n<p>torrent of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled</p>\n<p>down the ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime;</p>\n<p>the weaker buffaloes being shouldered out to the sides of</p>\n<p>the ravine where they tore through the creepers. They knew</p>\n<p>what the business was before them--the terrible charge of the</p>\n<p>buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand.</p>",
        "<p>Shere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself</p>\n<p>up, and lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to</p>\n<p>side for some way of escape, but the walls of</p>\n<p>the ravine were straight and he had to hold on,</p>\n<p>heavy with his dinner and his drink, willing to do</p>\n<p>anything rather than fight. The herd splashed through the pool</p>\n<p>he had just left, bellowing till the narrow cut rang.</p>",
        "<p>Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot of the</p>\n<p>ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the</p>\n<p>worst came to the worst it was better to meet</p>\n<p>the bulls than the cows with their calves), and then</p>\n<p>Rama tripped, stumbled, and went on again over something soft,</p>\n<p>and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into</p>\n<p>the other herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean</p>",
        "<p>off their feet by the shock of the meeting. That</p>\n<p>charge carried both herds out into the plain, goring and</p>\n<p>stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and slipped off</p>\n<p>Rama’s neck, laying about him right and left with his</p>\n<p>stick. “Quick, Akela! Break them up. Scatter them, or they</p>\n<p>will be fighting one another. Drive them away, Akela. Hai,</p>\n<p>Rama! Hai, hai, hai! my children. Softly now, softly! It</p>",
        "<p>is all over.” Akela and Gray Brother ran to and</p>\n<p>fro nipping the buffaloes’ legs, and though the herd wheeled</p>\n<p>once to charge up the ravine again, Mowgli managed to</p>\n<p>turn Rama, and the others followed him to the wallows.</p>\n<p>Shere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and</p>\n<p>the kites were coming for him already. “Brothers, that was</p>\n<p>a dog’s death,” said Mowgli, feeling for the knife he</p>",
        "<p>always carried in a sheath round his neck now that</p>\n<p>he lived with men. “But he would never have shown</p>\n<p>fight. His hide will look well on the Council Rock.</p>\n<p>We must get to work swiftly.” A boy trained among</p>\n<p>men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot tiger</p>\n<p>alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an</p>\n<p>animal’s skin is fitted on, and how it can be</p>",
        "<p>taken off. But it was hard work, and Mowgli slashed</p>\n<p>and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves</p>\n<p>lolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as</p>\n<p>he ordered them. Presently a hand fell on his shoulder,</p>\n<p>and looking up he saw Buldeo with the Tower musket.</p>\n<p>The children had told the village about the buffalo stampede,</p>\n<p>and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct</p>",
        "<p>Mowgli for not taking better care of the herd. The</p>\n<p>wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw</p>\n<p>the man coming. “What is this folly?” said Buldeo angrily.</p>\n<p>“To think that thou canst skin a tiger! Where did</p>\n<p>the buffaloes kill him? It is the Lame Tiger too,</p>\n<p>and there is a hundred rupees on his head. Well,</p>\n<p>well, we will overlook thy letting the herd run off,</p>",
        "<p>and perhaps I will give thee one of the rupees</p>\n<p>of the reward when I have taken the skin to</p>\n<p>Khanhiwara.” He fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and</p>\n<p>steel, and stooped down to singe Shere Khan’s whiskers. Most</p>\n<p>native hunters always singe a tiger’s whiskers to prevent his</p>\n<p>ghost from haunting them. “Hum!” said Mowgli, half to himself</p>\n<p>as he ripped back the skin of a forepaw. “So</p>",
        "<p>thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward,</p>\n<p>and perhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in</p>\n<p>my mind that I need the skin for my own</p>\n<p>use. Heh! Old man, take away that fire!” “What talk</p>\n<p>is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy</p>\n<p>luck and the stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee</p>\n<p>to this kill. The tiger has just fed, or he</p>",
        "<p>would have gone twenty miles by this time. Thou canst</p>\n<p>not even skin him properly, little beggar brat, and forsooth</p>\n<p>I, Buldeo, must be told not to singe his whiskers.</p>\n<p>Mowgli, I will not give thee one anna of the</p>\n<p>reward, but only a very big beating. Leave the carcass!”</p>\n<p>“By the Bull that bought me,” said Mowgli, who was</p>\n<p>trying to get at the shoulder, “must I stay babbling</p>",
        "<p>to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela, this man</p>\n<p>plagues me.” Buldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan’s</p>\n<p>head, found himself sprawling on the grass, with a gray</p>\n<p>wolf standing over him, while Mowgli went on skinning as</p>\n<p>though he were alone in all India. “Ye-es,” he said,</p>\n<p>between his teeth. “Thou art altogether right, Buldeo. Thou wilt</p>\n<p>never give me one anna of the reward. There is</p>",
        "<p>an old war between this lame tiger and myself--a very</p>\n<p>old war, and--I have won.” To do Buldeo justice, if</p>\n<p>he had been ten years younger he would have taken</p>\n<p>his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in</p>\n<p>the woods, but a wolf who obeyed the orders of</p>\n<p>this boy who had private wars with man-eating tigers was</p>\n<p>not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the</p>",
        "<p>worst kind, thought Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet</p>\n<p>round his neck would protect him. He lay as still</p>\n<p>as still, expecting every minute to see Mowgli turn into</p>\n<p>a tiger too. “Maharaj! Great King,” he said at last</p>\n<p>in a husky whisper. “Yes,” said Mowgli, without turning his</p>\n<p>head, chuckling a little. “I am an old man. I</p>\n<p>did not know that thou wast anything more than a</p>",
        "<p>herdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will</p>\n<p>thy servant tear me to pieces?” “Go, and peace go</p>\n<p>with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my</p>\n<p>game. Let him go, Akela.” Buldeo hobbled away to the</p>\n<p>village as fast as he could, looking back over his</p>\n<p>shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible. When</p>\n<p>he got to the village he told a tale of</p>",
        "<p>magic and enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look</p>\n<p>very grave. Mowgli went on with his work, but it</p>\n<p>was nearly twilight before he and the wolves had drawn</p>\n<p>the great gay skin clear of the body. “Now we</p>\n<p>must hide this and take the buffaloes home! Help me</p>\n<p>to herd them, Akela.” The herd rounded up in the</p>\n<p>misty twilight, and when they got near the village Mowgli</p>",
        "<p>saw lights, and heard the conches and bells in the</p>\n<p>temple blowing and banging. Half the village seemed to be</p>\n<p>waiting for him by the gate. “That is because I</p>\n<p>have killed Shere Khan,” he said to himself. But a</p>\n<p>shower of stones whistled about his ears, and the villagers</p>\n<p>shouted: “Sorcerer! Wolf’s brat! Jungle demon! Go away! Get hence</p>\n<p>quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf</p>",
        "<p>again. Shoot, Buldeo, shoot!” The old Tower musket went off</p>\n<p>with a bang, and a young buffalo bellowed in pain.</p>\n<p>“More sorcery!” shouted the villagers. “He can turn bullets. Buldeo,</p>\n<p>that was thy buffalo.” “Now what is this?” said Mowgli,</p>\n<p>bewildered, as the stones flew thicker. “They are not unlike</p>\n<p>the Pack, these brothers of thine,” said Akela, sitting down</p>\n<p>composedly. “It is in my head that, if bullets mean</p>",
        "<p>anything, they would cast thee out.” “Wolf! Wolf’s cub! Go</p>\n<p>away!” shouted the priest, waving a sprig of the sacred</p>\n<p>tulsi plant. “Again? Last time it was because I was</p>\n<p>a man. This time it is because I am a</p>\n<p>wolf. Let us go, Akela.” A woman--it was Messua--ran across</p>\n<p>to the herd, and cried: “Oh, my son, my son!</p>\n<p>They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself</p>",
        "<p>into a beast at will. I do not believe, but</p>\n<p>go away or they will kill thee. Buldeo says thou</p>\n<p>art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo’s</p>\n<p>death.” “Come back, Messua!” shouted the crowd. “Come back, or</p>\n<p>we will stone thee.” Mowgli laughed a little short ugly</p>\n<p>laugh, for a stone had hit him in the mouth.</p>\n<p>“Run back, Messua. This is one of the foolish tales</p>",
        "<p>they tell under the big tree at dusk. I have</p>\n<p>at least paid for thy son’s life. Farewell; and run</p>\n<p>quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly</p>\n<p>than their brickbats. I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!” “Now,</p>\n<p>once more, Akela,” he cried. “Bring the herd in.” The</p>\n<p>buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They</p>\n<p>hardly needed Akela’s yell, but charged through the gate like</p>",
        "<p>a whirlwind, scattering the crowd right and left. “Keep count!”</p>\n<p>shouted Mowgli scornfully. “It may be that I have stolen</p>\n<p>one of them. Keep count, for I will do your</p>\n<p>herding no more. Fare you well, children of men, and</p>\n<p>thank Messua that I do not come in with my</p>\n<p>wolves and hunt you up and down your street.” He</p>\n<p>turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone</p>",
        "<p>Wolf, and as he looked up at the stars he</p>\n<p>felt happy. “No more sleeping in traps for me, Akela.</p>\n<p>Let us get Shere Khan’s skin and go away. No,</p>\n<p>we will not hurt the village, for Messua was kind</p>\n<p>to me.” When the moon rose over the plain, making</p>\n<p>it look all milky, the horrified villagers saw Mowgli, with</p>\n<p>two wolves at his heels and a bundle on his</p>",
        "<p>head, trotting across at the steady wolf’s trot that eats</p>\n<p>up the long miles like fire. Then they banged the</p>\n<p>temple bells and blew the conches louder than ever. And</p>\n<p>Messua cried, and Buldeo embroidered the story of his adventures</p>\n<p>in the jungle, till he ended by saying that Akela</p>\n<p>stood up on his hind legs and talked like a</p>\n<p>man. The moon was just going down when Mowgli and</p>",
        "<p>the two wolves came to the hill of the Council</p>\n<p>Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf’s cave. “They have</p>\n<p>cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother,” shouted Mowgli, “but</p>\n<p>I come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep</p>\n<p>my word.” Mother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with</p>\n<p>the cubs behind her, and her eyes glowed as she</p>\n<p>saw the skin. “I told him on that day, when</p>",
        "<p>he crammed his head and shoulders into this cave, hunting</p>\n<p>for thy life, Little Frog--I told him that the hunter</p>\n<p>would be the hunted. It is well done.” “Little Brother,</p>\n<p>it is well done,” said a deep voice in the</p>\n<p>thicket. “We were lonely in the jungle without thee,” and</p>\n<p>Bagheera came running to Mowgli’s bare feet. They clambered up</p>\n<p>the Council Rock together, and Mowgli spread the skin out</p>",
        "<p>on the flat stone where Akela used to sit, and</p>\n<p>pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo, and Akela</p>\n<p>lay down upon it, and called the old call to</p>\n<p>the Council, “Look--look well, O Wolves,” exactly as he had</p>\n<p>called when Mowgli was first brought there. Ever since Akela</p>\n<p>had been deposed, the Pack had been without a leader,</p>\n<p>hunting and fighting at their own pleasure. But they answered</p>",
        "<p>the call from habit; and some of them were lame</p>\n<p>from the traps they had fallen into, and some limped</p>\n<p>from shot wounds, and some were mangy from eating bad</p>\n<p>food, and many were missing. But they came to the</p>\n<p>Council Rock, all that were left of them, and saw</p>\n<p>Shere Khan’s striped hide on the rock, and the huge</p>\n<p>claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet.</p>",
        "<p>It was then that Mowgli made up a song that</p>\n<p>came up into his throat all by itself, and he</p>\n<p>shouted it aloud, leaping up and down on the rattling</p>\n<p>skin, and beating time with his heels till he had</p>\n<p>no more breath left, while Gray Brother and Akela howled</p>\n<p>between the verses. “Look well, O Wolves. Have I kept</p>\n<p>my word?” said Mowgli. And the wolves bayed “Yes,” and</p>",
        "<p>one tattered wolf howled: “Lead us again, O Akela. Lead</p>\n<p>us again, O Man-cub, for we be sick of this</p>\n<p>lawlessness, and we would be the Free People once more.”</p>\n<p>“Nay,” purred Bagheera, “that may not be. When ye are</p>\n<p>full-fed, the madness may come upon you again. Not for</p>\n<p>nothing are ye called the Free People. Ye fought for</p>\n<p>freedom, and it is yours. Eat it, O Wolves.” “Man-Pack</p>",
        "<p>and Wolf-Pack have cast me out,” said Mowgli. “Now I</p>\n<p>will hunt alone in the jungle.” “And we will hunt</p>\n<p>with thee,” said the four cubs. So Mowgli went away</p>\n<p>and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from</p>\n<p>that day on. But he was not always alone, because,</p>\n<p>years afterward, he became a man and married. But that</p>\n<p>is a story for grown-ups. Mowgli’s Song THAT HE SANG</p>",
        "<p>AT THE COUNCIL ROCK WHEN HE DANCED ON SHERE KHAN’S</p>\n<p>HIDE The Song of Mowgli—I, Mowgli, am singing. Let the</p>\n<p>jungle listen to the things I have done. Shere Khan</p>\n<p>said he would kill—would kill! At the gates in the</p>\n<p>twilight he would kill Mowgli, the Frog! He ate and</p>\n<p>he drank. Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou</p>\n<p>drink again? Sleep and dream of the kill. I am</p>",
        "<p>alone on the grazing-grounds. Gray Brother, come to me! Come</p>\n<p>to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!</p>\n<p>Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls</p>\n<p>with the angry eyes. Drive them to and fro as</p>\n<p>I order. Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan? Wake, oh, wake!</p>\n<p>Here come I, and the bulls are behind. Rama, the</p>\n<p>King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his foot. Waters of</p>",
        "<p>the Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan? He is not Ikki</p>\n<p>to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that he should</p>\n<p>fly. He is not Mang the Bat, to hang in</p>\n<p>the branches. Little bamboos that creak together, tell me where</p>\n<p>he ran? _Ow!_ He is there. _Ahoo!_ He is there.</p>\n<p>Under the feet of Rama lies the Lame One! Up,</p>\n<p>Shere Khan! Up and kill! Here is meat; break the</p>",
        "<p>necks of the bulls! _Hsh!_ He is asleep. We will</p>\n<p>not wake him, for his strength is very great. The</p>\n<p>kites have come down to see it. The black ants</p>\n<p>have come up to know it. There is a great</p>\n<p>assembly in his honor. _Alala!_ I have no cloth to</p>\n<p>wrap me. The kites will see that I am naked.</p>\n<p>I am ashamed to meet all these people. Lend me</p>",
        "<p>thy coat, Shere Khan. Lend me thy gay striped coat</p>\n<p>that I may go to the Council Rock. By the</p>\n<p>Bull that bought me I made a promise—a little promise.</p>\n<p>Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.</p>\n<p>With the knife, with the knife that men use, with</p>\n<p>the knife of the hunter, I will stoop down for</p>\n<p>my gift. Waters of the Waingunga, Shere Khan gives me</p>",
        "<p>his coat for the love that he bears me. Pull,</p>\n<p>Gray Brother! Pull, Akela! Heavy is the hide of Shere</p>\n<p>Khan. The Man Pack are angry. They throw stones and</p>\n<p>talk child’s talk. My mouth is bleeding. Let me run</p>\n<p>away. Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly</p>\n<p>with me, my brothers. We will leave the lights of</p>\n<p>the village and go to the low moon. Waters of</p>",
        "<p>the Waingunga, the Man-Pack have cast me out. I did</p>\n<p>them no harm, but they were afraid of me. Why?</p>\n<p>Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too. The jungle</p>\n<p>is shut to me and the village gates are shut.</p>\n<p>Why? As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so</p>\n<p>fly I between the village and the jungle. Why? I</p>\n<p>dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart</p>",
        "<p>is very heavy. My mouth is cut and wounded with</p>\n<p>the stones from the village, but my heart is very</p>\n<p>light, because I have come back to the jungle. Why?</p>\n<p>These two things fight together in me as the snakes</p>\n<p>fight in the spring. The water comes out of my</p>\n<p>eyes; yet I laugh while it falls. Why? I am</p>\n<p>two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under</p>",
        "<p>my feet. All the jungle knows that I have killed</p>\n<p>Shere Khan. Look—look well, O Wolves! _Ahae!_ My heart is</p>\n<p>heavy with the things that I do not understand.</p>",

        "<p>slow-swinging seas! Seal Lullaby All these things happened several years</p>\n<p>ago at a place called Novastoshnah, or North East Point,</p>\n<p>on the Island of St. Paul, away and away in</p>\n<p>the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the</p>\n<p>tale when he was blown on to the rigging of</p>\n<p>a steamer going to Japan, and I took him down</p>\n<p>into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a</p>",
        "<p>couple of days till he was fit to fly back</p>\n<p>to St. Paul’s again. Limmershin is a very quaint little</p>\n<p>bird, but he knows how to tell the truth. Nobody</p>\n<p>comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people</p>\n<p>who have regular business there are the seals. They come</p>\n<p>in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands</p>\n<p>out of the cold gray sea. For Novastoshnah Beach has</p>",
        "<p>the finest accommodation for seals of any place in all</p>\n<p>the world. Sea Catch knew that, and every spring would</p>\n<p>swim from whatever place he happened to be in--would swim</p>\n<p>like a torpedo-boat straight for Novastoshnah and spend a month</p>\n<p>fighting with his companions for a good place on the</p>\n<p>rocks, as close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch</p>\n<p>was fifteen years old, a huge gray fur seal with</p>",
        "<p>almost a mane on his shoulders, and long, wicked dog</p>\n<p>teeth. When he heaved himself up on his front flippers</p>\n<p>he stood more than four feet clear of the ground,</p>\n<p>and his weight, if anyone had been bold enough to</p>\n<p>weigh him, was nearly seven hundred pounds. He was scarred</p>\n<p>all over with the marks of savage fights, but he</p>\n<p>was always ready for just one fight more. He would</p>",
        "<p>put his head on one side, as though he were</p>\n<p>afraid to look his enemy in the face; then he</p>\n<p>would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big</p>\n<p>teeth were firmly fixed on the other seal’s neck, the</p>\n<p>other seal might get away if he could, but Sea</p>\n<p>Catch would not help him. Yet Sea Catch never chased</p>\n<p>a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules of</p>",
        "<p>the Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for</p>\n<p>his nursery. But as there were forty or fifty thousand</p>\n<p>other seals hunting for the same thing each spring, the</p>\n<p>whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the beach was something</p>\n<p>frightful. From a little hill called Hutchinson’s Hill, you could</p>\n<p>look over three and a half miles of ground covered</p>\n<p>with fighting seals; and the surf was dotted all over</p>",
        "<p>with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin</p>\n<p>their share of the fighting. They fought in the breakers,</p>\n<p>they fought in the sand, and they fought on the</p>\n<p>smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries, for they were just</p>\n<p>as stupid and unaccommodating as men. Their wives never came</p>\n<p>to the island until late in May or early in</p>\n<p>June, for they did not care to be torn to</p>",
        "<p>pieces; and the young two-, three-, and four-year-old seals who</p>\n<p>had not begun housekeeping went inland about half a mile</p>\n<p>through the ranks of the fighters and played about on</p>\n<p>the sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off</p>\n<p>every single green thing that grew. They were called the</p>\n<p>holluschickie--the bachelors--and there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand</p>\n<p>of them at Novastoshnah alone. Sea Catch had just finished</p>",
        "<p>his forty-fifth fight one spring when Matkah, his soft, sleek,</p>\n<p>gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea, and he</p>\n<p>caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped</p>\n<p>her down on his reservation, saying gruffly: “Late as usual.</p>\n<p>Where have you been?” It was not the fashion for</p>\n<p>Sea Catch to eat anything during the four months he</p>\n<p>stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally</p>",
        "<p>bad. Matkah knew better than to answer back. She looked</p>\n<p>round and cooed: “How thoughtful of you. You’ve taken the</p>\n<p>old place again.” “I should think I had,” said Sea</p>\n<p>Catch. “Look at me!” He was scratched and bleeding in</p>\n<p>twenty places; one eye was almost out, and his sides</p>\n<p>were torn to ribbons. “Oh, you men, you men!” Matkah</p>\n<p>said, fanning herself with her hind flipper. “Why can’t you</p>",
        "<p>be sensible and settle your places quietly? You look as</p>\n<p>though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.” “I</p>\n<p>haven’t been doing anything but fight since the middle of</p>\n<p>May. The beach is disgracefully crowded this season. I’ve met</p>\n<p>at least a hundred seals from Lukannon Beach, house hunting.</p>\n<p>Why can’t people stay where they belong?” “I’ve often thought</p>\n<p>we should be much happier if we hauled out at</p>",
        "<p>Otter Island instead of this crowded place,” said Matkah. “Bah!</p>\n<p>Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went</p>\n<p>there they would say we were afraid. We must preserve</p>\n<p>appearances, my dear.” Sea Catch sunk his head proudly between</p>\n<p>his fat shoulders and pretended to go to sleep for</p>\n<p>a few minutes, but all the time he was keeping</p>\n<p>a sharp lookout for a fight. Now that all the</p>",
        "<p>seals and their wives were on the land, you could</p>\n<p>hear their clamor miles out to sea above the loudest</p>\n<p>gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million</p>\n<p>seals on the beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, and</p>\n<p>holluschickie, fighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and playing together--going down to</p>\n<p>the sea and coming up from it in gangs and</p>\n<p>regiments, lying over every foot of ground as far as</p>",
        "<p>the eye could reach, and skirmishing about in brigades through</p>\n<p>the fog. It is nearly always foggy at Novastoshnah, except</p>\n<p>when the sun comes out and makes everything look all</p>\n<p>pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while. Kotick, Matkah’s baby,</p>\n<p>was born in the middle of that confusion, and he</p>\n<p>was all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes,</p>\n<p>as tiny seals must be, but there was something about</p>",
        "<p>his coat that made his mother look at him very</p>\n<p>closely. “Sea Catch,” she said, at last, “our baby’s going</p>\n<p>to be white!” “Empty clam-shells and dry seaweed!” snorted Sea</p>\n<p>Catch. “There never has been such a thing in the</p>\n<p>world as a white seal.” “I can’t help that,” said</p>\n<p>Matkah; “there’s going to be now.” And she sang the</p>\n<p>low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing</p>",
        "<p>to their babies: You mustn’t swim till you’re six weeks</p>\n<p>old, Or your head will be sunk by your heels;</p>\n<p>And summer gales and Killer Whales Are bad for baby</p>\n<p>seals. Are bad for baby seals, dear rat, As bad</p>\n<p>as bad can be; But splash and grow strong, And</p>\n<p>you can’t be wrong. Child of the Open Sea! Of</p>\n<p>course the little fellow did not understand the words at</p>",
        "<p>first. He paddled and scrambled about by his mother’s side,</p>\n<p>and learned to scuffle out of the way when his</p>\n<p>father was fighting with another seal, and the two rolled</p>\n<p>and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used</p>\n<p>to go to sea to get things to eat, and</p>\n<p>the baby was fed only once in two days, but</p>\n<p>then he ate all he could and throve upon it.</p>",
        "<p>The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and</p>\n<p>there he met tens of thousands of babies of his</p>\n<p>own age, and they played together like puppies, went to</p>\n<p>sleep on the clean sand, and played again. The old</p>\n<p>people in the nurseries took no notice of them, and</p>\n<p>the holluschickie kept to their own grounds, and the babies</p>\n<p>had a beautiful playtime. When Matkah came back from her</p>",
        "<p>deep-sea fishing she would go straight to their playground and</p>\n<p>call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait</p>\n<p>until she heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take the</p>\n<p>straightest of straight lines in his direction, striking out with</p>\n<p>her fore flippers and knocking the youngsters head over heels</p>\n<p>right and left. There were always a few hundred mothers</p>\n<p>hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and the babies</p>",
        "<p>were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, “So long</p>\n<p>as you don’t lie in muddy water and get mange,</p>\n<p>or rub the hard sand into a cut or scratch,</p>\n<p>and so long as you never go swimming when there</p>\n<p>is a heavy sea, nothing will hurt you here.” Little</p>\n<p>seals can no more swim than little children, but they</p>\n<p>are unhappy till they learn. The first time that Kotick</p>",
        "<p>went down to the sea a wave carried him out</p>\n<p>beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his</p>\n<p>little hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had</p>\n<p>told him in the song, and if the next wave</p>\n<p>had not thrown him back again he would have drowned.</p>\n<p>After that, he learned to lie in a beach pool</p>\n<p>and let the wash of the waves just cover him</p>",
        "<p>and lift him up while he paddled, but he always</p>\n<p>kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt.</p>\n<p>He was two weeks learning to use his flippers; and</p>\n<p>all that while he floundered in and out of the</p>\n<p>water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach</p>\n<p>and took catnaps on the sand, and went back again,</p>\n<p>until at last he found that he truly belonged to</p>",
        "<p>the water. Then you can imagine the times that he</p>\n<p>had with his companions, ducking under the rollers; or coming</p>\n<p>in on top of a comber and landing with a</p>\n<p>swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling</p>\n<p>far up the beach; or standing up on his tail</p>\n<p>and scratching his head as the old people did; or</p>\n<p>playing “I’m the King of the Castle” on slippery, weedy</p>",
        "<p>rocks that just stuck out of the wash. Now and</p>\n<p>then he would see a thin fin, like a big</p>\n<p>shark’s fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew</p>\n<p>that that was the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats</p>\n<p>young seals when he can get them; and Kotick would</p>\n<p>head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin</p>\n<p>would jig off slowly, as if it were looking for</p>",
        "<p>nothing at all. Late in October the seals began to</p>\n<p>leave St. Paul’s for the deep sea, by families and</p>\n<p>tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries,</p>\n<p>and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. “Next year,” said</p>\n<p>Matkah to Kotick, “you will be a holluschickie; but this</p>\n<p>year you must learn how to catch fish.” They set</p>\n<p>out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how</p>",
        "<p>to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down</p>\n<p>by his side and his little nose just out of</p>\n<p>the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the long,</p>\n<p>rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin</p>\n<p>tingle all over, Matkah told him he was learning the</p>\n<p>“feel of the water,” and that tingly, prickly feelings meant</p>\n<p>bad weather coming, and he must swim hard and get</p>",
        "<p>away. “In a little time,” she said, “you’ll know where</p>\n<p>to swim to, but just now we’ll follow Sea Pig,</p>\n<p>the Porpoise, for he is very wise.” A school of</p>\n<p>porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water, and little</p>\n<p>Kotick followed them as fast as he could. “How do</p>\n<p>you know where to go to?” he panted. The leader</p>\n<p>of the school rolled his white eye and ducked under.</p>",
        "<p>“My tail tingles, youngster,” he said. “That means there’s a</p>\n<p>gale behind me. Come along! When you’re south of the</p>\n<p>Sticky Water [he meant the Equator] and your tail tingles,</p>\n<p>that means there’s a gale in front of you and</p>\n<p>you must head north. Come along! The water feels bad</p>\n<p>here.” This was one of very many things that Kotick</p>\n<p>learned, and he was always learning. Matkah taught him to</p>",
        "<p>follow the cod and the halibut along the under-sea banks</p>\n<p>and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the</p>\n<p>weeds; how to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms</p>\n<p>below water and dart like a rifle bullet in at</p>\n<p>one porthole and out at another as the fishes ran;</p>\n<p>how to dance on the top of the waves when</p>\n<p>the lightning was racing all over the sky, and wave</p>",
        "<p>his flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed Albatross and the Man-of-war</p>\n<p>Hawk as they went down the wind; how to jump</p>\n<p>three or four feet clear of the water like a</p>\n<p>dolphin, flippers close to the side and tail curved; to</p>\n<p>leave the flying fish alone because they are all bony;</p>\n<p>to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at full</p>\n<p>speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look</p>",
        "<p>at a boat or a ship, but particularly a row-boat.</p>\n<p>At the end of six months what Kotick did not</p>\n<p>know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And</p>\n<p>all that time he never set flipper on dry ground.</p>\n<p>One day, however, as he was lying half asleep in</p>\n<p>the warm water somewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez,</p>\n<p>he felt faint and lazy all over, just as human</p>",
        "<p>people do when the spring is in their legs, and</p>\n<p>he remembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand</p>\n<p>miles away, the games his companions played, the smell of</p>\n<p>the seaweed, the seal roar, and the fighting. That very</p>\n<p>minute he turned north, swimming steadily, and as he went</p>\n<p>on he met scores of his mates, all bound for</p>\n<p>the same place, and they said: “Greeting, Kotick! This year</p>",
        "<p>we are all holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance</p>\n<p>in the breakers off Lukannon and play on the new</p>\n<p>grass. But where did you get that coat?” Kotick’s fur</p>\n<p>was almost pure white now, and though he felt very</p>\n<p>proud of it, he only said, “Swim quickly! My bones</p>\n<p>are aching for the land.” And so they all came</p>\n<p>to the beaches where they had been born, and heard</p>",
        "<p>the old seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist.</p>\n<p>That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals.</p>\n<p>The sea is full of fire on summer nights all</p>\n<p>the way down from Novastoshnah to Lukannon, and each seal</p>\n<p>leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a</p>\n<p>flaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in</p>\n<p>great phosphorescent streaks and swirls. Then they went inland to</p>",
        "<p>the holluschickie grounds and rolled up and down in the</p>\n<p>new wild wheat and told stories of what they had</p>\n<p>done while they had been at sea. They talked about</p>\n<p>the Pacific as boys would talk about a wood that</p>\n<p>they had been nutting in, and if anyone had understood</p>\n<p>them he could have gone away and made such a</p>\n<p>chart of that ocean as never was. The three- and</p>",
        "<p>four-year-old holluschickie romped down from Hutchinson’s Hill crying: “Out of</p>\n<p>the way, youngsters! The sea is deep and you don’t</p>\n<p>know all that’s in it yet. Wait till you’ve rounded</p>\n<p>the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that</p>\n<p>white coat?” “I didn’t get it,” said Kotick. “It grew.”</p>\n<p>And just as he was going to roll the speaker</p>\n<p>over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces</p>",
        "<p>came from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had</p>\n<p>never seen a man before, coughed and lowered his head.</p>\n<p>The holluschickie just bundled off a few yards and sat</p>\n<p>staring stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick Booterin,</p>\n<p>the chief of the seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon,</p>\n<p>his son. They came from the little village not half</p>\n<p>a mile from the sea nurseries, and they were deciding</p>",
        "<p>what seals they would drive up to the killing pens--for</p>\n<p>the seals were driven just like sheep--to be turned into</p>\n<p>seal-skin jackets later on. “Ho!” said Patalamon. “Look! There’s a</p>\n<p>white seal!” Kerick Booterin turned nearly white under his oil</p>\n<p>and smoke, for he was an Aleut, and Aleuts are</p>\n<p>not clean people. Then he began to mutter a prayer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t touch him, Patalamon. There has never been a white</p>",
        "<p>seal since--since I was born. Perhaps it is old Zaharrof’s</p>\n<p>ghost. He was lost last year in the big gale.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going near him,” said Patalamon. “He’s unlucky. Do</p>\n<p>you really think he is old Zaharrof come back? I</p>\n<p>owe him for some gulls’ eggs.” “Don’t look at him,”</p>\n<p>said Kerick. “Head off that drove of four-year-olds. The men</p>\n<p>ought to skin two hundred to-day, but it’s the beginning</p>",
        "<p>of the season and they are new to the work.</p>\n<p>A hundred will do. Quick!” Patalamon rattled a pair of</p>\n<p>seal’s shoulder bones in front of a herd of holluschickie</p>\n<p>and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing. Then he stepped</p>\n<p>near and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed</p>\n<p>them inland, and they never tried to get back to</p>\n<p>their companions. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched</p>",
        "<p>them being driven, but they went on playing just the</p>\n<p>same. Kotick was the only one who asked questions, and</p>\n<p>none of his companions could tell him anything, except that</p>\n<p>the men always drove seals in that way for six</p>\n<p>weeks or two months of every year. “I am going</p>\n<p>to follow,” he said, and his eyes nearly popped out</p>\n<p>of his head as he shuffled along in the wake</p>",
        "<p>of the herd. “The white seal is coming after us,”</p>\n<p>cried Patalamon. “That’s the first time a seal has ever</p>\n<p>come to the killing-grounds alone.” “Hsh! Don’t look behind you,”</p>\n<p>said Kerick. “It is Zaharrof’s ghost! I must speak to</p>\n<p>the priest about this.” The distance to the killing-grounds was</p>\n<p>only half a mile, but it took an hour to</p>\n<p>cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew</p>",
        "<p>that they would get heated and then their fur would</p>\n<p>come off in patches when they were skinned. So they</p>\n<p>went on very slowly, past Sea Lion’s Neck, past Webster</p>\n<p>House, till they came to the Salt House just beyond</p>\n<p>the sight of the seals on the beach. Kotick followed,</p>\n<p>panting and wondering. He thought that he was at the</p>\n<p>world’s end, but the roar of the seal nurseries behind</p>",
        "<p>him sounded as loud as the roar of a train</p>\n<p>in a tunnel. Then Kerick sat down on the moss</p>\n<p>and pulled out a heavy pewter watch and let the</p>\n<p>drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear</p>\n<p>the fog-dew dripping off the brim of his cap. Then</p>\n<p>ten or twelve men, each with an iron-bound club three</p>\n<p>or four feet long, came up, and Kerick pointed out</p>",
        "<p>one or two of the drove that were bitten by</p>\n<p>their companions or too hot, and the men kicked those</p>\n<p>aside with their heavy boots made of the skin of</p>\n<p>a walrus’s throat, and then Kerick said, “Let go!” and</p>\n<p>then the men clubbed the seals on the head as</p>\n<p>fast as they could. Ten minutes later little Kotick did</p>\n<p>not recognize his friends any more, for their skins were</p>",
        "<p>ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers, whipped</p>\n<p>off and thrown down on the ground in a pile.</p>\n<p>That was enough for Kotick. He turned and galloped (a</p>\n<p>seal can gallop very swiftly for a short time) back</p>\n<p>to the sea; his little new mustache bristling with horror.</p>\n<p>At Sea Lion’s Neck, where the great sea lions sit</p>\n<p>on the edge of the surf, he flung himself flipper-overhead</p>",
        "<p>into the cool water and rocked there, gasping miserably. “What’s</p>\n<p>here?” said a sea lion gruffly, for as a rule</p>\n<p>the sea lions keep themselves to themselves. “Scoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!”</p>\n<p>(“I’m lonesome, very lonesome!”) said Kotick. “They’re killing all the</p>\n<p>holluschickie on all the beaches!” The Sea Lion turned his</p>\n<p>head inshore. “Nonsense!” he said. “Your friends are making as</p>\n<p>much noise as ever. You must have seen old Kerick</p>",
        "<p>polishing off a drove. He’s done that for thirty years.”</p>\n<p>“It’s horrible,” said Kotick, backing water as a wave went</p>\n<p>over him, and steadying himself with a screw stroke of</p>\n<p>his flippers that brought him all standing within three inches</p>\n<p>of a jagged edge of rock. “Well done for a</p>\n<p>yearling!” said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good swimming.</p>\n<p>“I suppose it is rather awful from your way of</p>",
        "<p>looking at it, but if you seals will come here</p>\n<p>year after year, of course the men get to know</p>\n<p>of it, and unless you can find an island where</p>\n<p>no men ever come you will always be driven.” “Isn’t</p>\n<p>there any such island?” began Kotick. “I’ve followed the poltoos</p>\n<p>[the halibut] for twenty years, and I can’t say I’ve</p>\n<p>found it yet. But look here--you seem to have a</p>",
        "<p>fondness for talking to your betters--suppose you go to Walrus</p>\n<p>Islet and talk to Sea Vitch. He may know something.</p>\n<p>Don’t flounce off like that. It’s a six-mile swim, and</p>\n<p>if I were you I should haul out and take</p>\n<p>a nap first, little one.” Kotick thought that that was</p>\n<p>good advice, so he swam round to his own beach,</p>\n<p>hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all</p>",
        "<p>over, as seals will. Then he headed straight for Walrus</p>\n<p>Islet, a little low sheet of rocky island almost due</p>\n<p>northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and rock and gulls’ nests,</p>\n<p>where the walrus herded by themselves. He landed close to</p>\n<p>old Sea Vitch--the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus</p>\n<p>of the North Pacific, who has no manners except when</p>\n<p>he is asleep--as he was then, with his hind flippers</p>",
        "<p>half in and half out of the surf. “Wake up!”</p>\n<p>barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise.</p>\n<p>“Hah! Ho! Hmph! What’s that?” said Sea Vitch, and he</p>\n<p>struck the next walrus a blow with his tusks and</p>\n<p>waked him up, and the next struck the next, and</p>\n<p>so on till they were all awake and staring in</p>\n<p>every direction but the right one. “Hi! It’s me,” said</p>",
        "<p>Kotick, bobbing in the surf and looking like a little</p>\n<p>white slug. “Well! May I be--skinned!” said Sea Vitch, and</p>\n<p>they all looked at Kotick as you can fancy a</p>\n<p>club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a</p>\n<p>little boy. Kotick did not care to hear any more</p>\n<p>about skinning just then; he had seen enough of it.</p>\n<p>So he called out: “Isn’t there any place for seals</p>",
        "<p>to go where men don’t ever come?” “Go and find</p>\n<p>out,” said Sea Vitch, shutting his eyes. “Run away. We’re</p>\n<p>busy here.” Kotick made his dolphin-jump in the air and</p>\n<p>shouted as loud as he could: “Clam-eater! Clam-eater!” He knew</p>\n<p>that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in his life</p>\n<p>but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he pretended</p>\n<p>to be a very terrible person. Naturally the Chickies and</p>",
        "<p>the Gooverooskies and the Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes</p>\n<p>and the Puffins, who are always looking for a chance</p>\n<p>to be rude, took up the cry, and--so Limmershin told</p>\n<p>me--for nearly five minutes you could not have heard a</p>\n<p>gun fired on Walrus Islet. All the population was yelling</p>\n<p>and screaming “Clam-eater! Stareek [old man]!” while Sea Vitch rolled</p>\n<p>from side to side grunting and coughing. “Now will you</p>",
        "<p>tell?” said Kotick, all out of breath. “Go and ask</p>\n<p>Sea Cow,” said Sea Vitch. “If he is living still,</p>\n<p>he’ll be able to tell you.” “How shall I know</p>\n<p>Sea Cow when I meet him?” said Kotick, sheering off.</p>\n<p>“He’s the only thing in the sea uglier than Sea</p>\n<p>Vitch,” screamed a Burgomaster gull, wheeling under Sea Vitch’s nose.</p>\n<p>“Uglier, and with worse manners! Stareek!” Kotick swam back to</p>",
        "<p>Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he found that</p>\n<p>no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to</p>\n<p>discover a quiet place for the seals. They told him</p>\n<p>that men had always driven the holluschickie--it was part of</p>\n<p>the day’s work--and that if he did not like to</p>\n<p>see ugly things he should not have gone to the</p>\n<p>killing grounds. But none of the other seals had seen</p>",
        "<p>the killing, and that made the difference between him and</p>\n<p>his friends. Besides, Kotick was a white seal. “What you</p>\n<p>must do,” said old Sea Catch, after he had heard</p>\n<p>his son’s adventures, “is to grow up and be a</p>\n<p>big seal like your father, and have a nursery on</p>\n<p>the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In</p>\n<p>another five years you ought to be able to fight</p>",
        "<p>for yourself.” Even gentle Matkah, his mother, said: “You will</p>\n<p>never be able to stop the killing. Go and play</p>\n<p>in the sea, Kotick.” And Kotick went off and danced</p>\n<p>the Fire-dance with a very heavy little heart. That autumn</p>\n<p>he left the beach as soon as he could, and</p>\n<p>set off alone because of a notion in his bullet-head.</p>\n<p>He was going to find Sea Cow, if there was</p>",
        "<p>such a person in the sea, and he was going</p>\n<p>to find a quiet island with good firm beaches for</p>\n<p>seals to live on, where men could not get at</p>\n<p>them. So he explored and explored by himself from the</p>\n<p>North to the South Pacific, swimming as much as three</p>\n<p>hundred miles in a day and a night. He met</p>\n<p>with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly escaped</p>",
        "<p>being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark,</p>\n<p>and the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians</p>\n<p>that loaf up and down the seas, and the heavy</p>\n<p>polite fish, and the scarlet spotted scallops that are moored</p>\n<p>in one place for hundreds of years, and grow very</p>\n<p>proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and</p>\n<p>he never found an island that he could fancy. If</p>",
        "<p>the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind</p>\n<p>it for seals to play on, there was always the</p>\n<p>smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down blubber,</p>\n<p>and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could</p>\n<p>see that seals had once visited the island and been</p>\n<p>killed off, and Kotick knew that where men had come</p>\n<p>once they would come again. He picked up with an</p>",
        "<p>old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that Kerguelen Island was</p>\n<p>the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick</p>\n<p>went down there he was all but smashed to pieces</p>\n<p>against some wicked black cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with</p>\n<p>lightning and thunder. Yet as he pulled out against the</p>\n<p>gale he could see that even there had once been</p>\n<p>a seal nursery. And it was so in all the</p>",
        "<p>other islands that he visited. Limmershin gave a long list</p>\n<p>of them, for he said that Kotick spent five seasons</p>\n<p>exploring, with a four months’ rest each year at Novastoshnah,</p>\n<p>when the holluschickie used to make fun of him and</p>\n<p>his imaginary islands. He went to the Gallapagos, a horrid</p>\n<p>dry place on the Equator, where he was nearly baked</p>\n<p>to death; he went to the Georgia Islands, the Orkneys,</p>",
        "<p>Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Gough’s Island, Bouvet’s Island, the</p>\n<p>Crossets, and even to a little speck of an island</p>\n<p>south of the Cape of Good Hope. But everywhere the</p>\n<p>People of the Sea told him the same things. Seals</p>\n<p>had come to those islands once upon a time, but</p>\n<p>men had killed them all off. Even when he swam</p>\n<p>thousands of miles out of the Pacific and got to</p>",
        "<p>a place called Cape Corrientes (that was when he was</p>\n<p>coming back from Gough’s Island), he found a few hundred</p>\n<p>mangy seals on a rock and they told him that</p>\n<p>men came there too. That nearly broke his heart, and</p>\n<p>he headed round the Horn back to his own beaches;</p>\n<p>and on his way north he hauled out on an</p>\n<p>island full of green trees, where he found an old,</p>",
        "<p>old seal who was dying, and Kotick caught fish for</p>\n<p>him and told him all his sorrows. “Now,” said Kotick,</p>\n<p>“I am going back to Novastoshnah, and if I am</p>\n<p>driven to the killing-pens with the holluschickie I shall not</p>\n<p>care.” The old seal said, “Try once more. I am</p>\n<p>the last of the Lost Rookery of Masafuera, and in</p>\n<p>the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand</p>",
        "<p>there was a story on the beaches that some day</p>\n<p>a white seal would come out of the North and</p>\n<p>lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am</p>\n<p>old, and I shall never live to see that day,</p>\n<p>but others will. Try once more.” And Kotick curled up</p>\n<p>his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, “I am</p>\n<p>the only white seal that has ever been born on</p>",
        "<p>the beaches, and I am the only seal, black or</p>\n<p>white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.” This</p>\n<p>cheered him immensely; and when he came back to Novastoshnah</p>\n<p>that summer, Matkah, his mother, begged him to marry and</p>\n<p>settle down, for he was no longer a holluschick but</p>\n<p>a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly white mane on his</p>\n<p>shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his</p>",
        "<p>father. “Give me another season,” he said. “Remember, Mother, it</p>\n<p>is always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the</p>\n<p>beach.” Curiously enough, there was another seal who thought that</p>\n<p>she would put off marrying till the next year, and</p>\n<p>Kotick danced the Fire-dance with her all down Lukannon Beach</p>\n<p>the night before he set off on his last exploration.</p>\n<p>This time he went westward, because he had fallen on</p>",
        "<p>the trail of a great shoal of halibut, and he</p>\n<p>needed at least one hundred pounds of fish a day</p>\n<p>to keep him in good condition. He chased them till</p>\n<p>he was tired, and then he curled himself up and</p>\n<p>went to sleep on the hollows of the ground swell</p>\n<p>that sets in to Copper Island. He knew the coast</p>\n<p>perfectly well, so about midnight, when he felt himself gently</p>",
        "<p>bumped on a weed-bed, he said, “Hm, tide’s running strong</p>\n<p>tonight,” and turning over under water opened his eyes slowly</p>\n<p>and stretched. Then he jumped like a cat, for he</p>\n<p>saw huge things nosing about in the shoal water and</p>\n<p>browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds. “By the</p>\n<p>Great Combers of Magellan!” he said, beneath his mustache. “Who</p>\n<p>in the Deep Sea are these people?” They were like</p>",
        "<p>no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish, squid,</p>\n<p>or scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were</p>\n<p>between twenty and thirty feet long, and they had no</p>\n<p>hind flippers, but a shovel-like tail that looked as if</p>\n<p>it had been whittled out of wet leather. Their heads</p>\n<p>were the most foolish-looking things you ever saw, and they</p>\n<p>balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water</p>",
        "<p>when they weren’t grazing, bowing solemnly to each other and</p>\n<p>waving their front flippers as a fat man waves his</p>\n<p>arm. “Ahem!” said Kotick. “Good sport, gentlemen?” The big things</p>\n<p>answered by bowing and waving their flippers like the Frog</p>\n<p>Footman. When they began feeding again Kotick saw that their</p>\n<p>upper lip was split into two pieces that they could</p>\n<p>twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with</p>",
        "<p>a whole bushel of seaweed between the splits. They tucked</p>\n<p>the stuff into their mouths and chumped solemnly. “Messy style</p>\n<p>of feeding, that,” said Kotick. They bowed again, and Kotick</p>\n<p>began to lose his temper. “Very good,” he said. “If</p>\n<p>you do happen to have an extra joint in your</p>\n<p>front flipper you needn’t show off so. I see you</p>\n<p>bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names.”</p>",
        "<p>The split lips moved and twitched; and the glassy green</p>\n<p>eyes stared, but they did not speak. “Well!” said Kotick.</p>\n<p>“You’re the only people I’ve ever met uglier than Sea</p>\n<p>Vitch--and with worse manners.” Then he remembered in a flash</p>\n<p>what the Burgomaster gull had screamed to him when he</p>\n<p>was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled</p>\n<p>backward in the water, for he knew that he had</p>",
        "<p>found Sea Cow at last. The sea cows went on</p>\n<p>schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed, and Kotick</p>\n<p>asked them questions in every language that he had picked</p>\n<p>up in his travels; and the Sea People talk nearly</p>\n<p>as many languages as human beings. But the sea cows</p>\n<p>did not answer because Sea Cow cannot talk. He has</p>\n<p>only six bones in his neck where he ought to</p>",
        "<p>have seven, and they say under the sea that that</p>\n<p>prevents him from speaking even to his companions. But, as</p>\n<p>you know, he has an extra joint in his foreflipper,</p>\n<p>and by waving it up and down and about he</p>\n<p>makes what answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.</p>\n<p>By daylight Kotick’s mane was standing on end and his</p>\n<p>temper was gone where the dead crabs go. Then the</p>",
        "<p>Sea Cow began to travel northward very slowly, stopping to</p>\n<p>hold absurd bowing councils from time to time, and Kotick</p>\n<p>followed them, saying to himself, “People who are such idiots</p>\n<p>as these are would have been killed long ago if</p>\n<p>they hadn’t found out some safe island. And what is</p>\n<p>good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for</p>\n<p>the Sea Catch. All the same, I wish they’d hurry.”</p>",
        "<p>It was weary work for Kotick. The herd never went</p>\n<p>more than forty or fifty miles a day, and stopped</p>\n<p>to feed at night, and kept close to the shore</p>\n<p>all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over</p>\n<p>them, and under them, but he could not hurry them</p>\n<p>up one-half mile. As they went farther north they held</p>\n<p>a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick nearly bit</p>",
        "<p>off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they</p>\n<p>were following up a warm current of water, and then</p>\n<p>he respected them more. One night they sank through the</p>\n<p>shiny water--sank like stones--and for the first time since he</p>\n<p>had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick followed, and</p>\n<p>the pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea</p>\n<p>Cow was anything of a swimmer. They headed for a</p>",
        "<p>cliff by the shore--a cliff that ran down into deep</p>\n<p>water, and plunged into a dark hole at the foot</p>\n<p>of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. It was a</p>\n<p>long, long swim, and Kotick badly wanted fresh air before</p>\n<p>he was out of the dark tunnel they led him</p>\n<p>through. “My wig!” he said, when he rose, gasping and</p>\n<p>puffing, into open water at the farther end. “It was</p>",
        "<p>a long dive, but it was worth it.” The sea</p>\n<p>cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges</p>\n<p>of the finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There</p>\n<p>were long stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly</p>\n<p>fitted to make seal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard</p>\n<p>sand sloping inland behind them, and there were rollers for</p>\n<p>seals to dance in, and long grass to roll in,</p>",
        "<p>and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best</p>\n<p>of all, Kotick knew by the feel of the water,</p>\n<p>which never deceives a true sea catch, that no men</p>\n<p>had ever come there. The first thing he did was</p>\n<p>to assure himself that the fishing was good, and then</p>\n<p>he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful</p>\n<p>low sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog.</p>",
        "<p>Away to the northward, out to sea, ran a line</p>\n<p>of bars and shoals and rocks that would never let</p>\n<p>a ship come within six miles of the beach, and</p>\n<p>between the islands and the mainland was a stretch of</p>\n<p>deep water that ran up to the perpendicular cliffs, and</p>\n<p>somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>“It’s Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,” said Kotick.</p>",
        "<p>“Sea Cow must be wiser than I thought. Men can’t</p>\n<p>come down the cliffs, even if there were any men;</p>\n<p>and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to</p>\n<p>splinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this</p>\n<p>is it.” He began to think of the seal he</p>\n<p>had left behind him, but though he was in a</p>\n<p>hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the</p>",
        "<p>new country, so that he would be able to answer</p>\n<p>all questions. Then he dived and made sure of the</p>\n<p>mouth of the tunnel, and raced through to the southward.</p>\n<p>No one but a sea cow or a seal would</p>\n<p>have dreamed of there being such a place, and when</p>\n<p>he looked back at the cliffs even Kotick could hardly</p>\n<p>believe that he had been under them. He was six</p>",
        "<p>days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and</p>\n<p>when he hauled out just above Sea Lion’s Neck the</p>\n<p>first person he met was the seal who had been</p>\n<p>waiting for him, and she saw by the look in</p>\n<p>his eyes that he had found his island at last.</p>\n<p>But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all</p>\n<p>the other seals laughed at him when he told them</p>",
        "<p>what he had discovered, and a young seal about his</p>\n<p>own age said, “This is all very well, Kotick, but</p>\n<p>you can’t come from no one knows where and order</p>\n<p>us off like this. Remember we’ve been fighting for our</p>\n<p>nurseries, and that’s a thing you never did. You preferred</p>\n<p>prowling about in the sea.” The other seals laughed at</p>\n<p>this, and the young seal began twisting his head from</p>",
        "<p>side to side. He had just married that year, and</p>\n<p>was making a great fuss about it. “I’ve no nursery</p>\n<p>to fight for,” said Kotick. “I only want to show</p>\n<p>you all a place where you will be safe. What’s</p>\n<p>the use of fighting?” “Oh, if you’re trying to back</p>\n<p>out, of course I’ve no more to say,” said the</p>\n<p>young seal with an ugly chuckle. “Will you come with</p>",
        "<p>me if I win?” said Kotick. And a green light</p>\n<p>came into his eye, for he was very angry at</p>\n<p>having to fight at all. “Very good,” said the young</p>\n<p>seal carelessly. “If you win, I’ll come.” He had no</p>\n<p>time to change his mind, for Kotick’s head was out</p>\n<p>and his teeth sunk in the blubber of the young</p>\n<p>seal’s neck. Then he threw himself back on his haunches</p>",
        "<p>and hauled his enemy down the beach, shook him, and</p>\n<p>knocked him over. Then Kotick roared to the seals: “I’ve</p>\n<p>done my best for you these five seasons past. I’ve</p>\n<p>found you the island where you’ll be safe, but unless</p>\n<p>your heads are dragged off your silly necks you won’t</p>\n<p>believe. I’m going to teach you now. Look out for</p>\n<p>yourselves!” Limmershin told me that never in his life--and Limmershin</p>",
        "<p>sees ten thousand big seals fighting every year--never in all</p>\n<p>his little life did he see anything like Kotick’s charge</p>\n<p>into the nurseries. He flung himself at the biggest sea</p>\n<p>catch he could find, caught him by the throat, choked</p>\n<p>him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted</p>\n<p>for mercy, and then threw him aside and attacked the</p>\n<p>next. You see, Kotick had never fasted for four months</p>",
        "<p>as the big seals did every year, and his deep-sea</p>\n<p>swimming trips kept him in perfect condition, and, best of</p>\n<p>all, he had never fought before. His curly white mane</p>\n<p>stood up with rage, and his eyes flamed, and his</p>\n<p>big dog teeth glistened, and he was splendid to look</p>\n<p>at. Old Sea Catch, his father, saw him tearing past,</p>\n<p>hauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had</p>",
        "<p>been halibut, and upsetting the young bachelors in all directions;</p>\n<p>and Sea Catch gave a roar and shouted: “He may</p>\n<p>be a fool, but he is the best fighter on</p>\n<p>the beaches! Don’t tackle your father, my son! He’s with</p>\n<p>you!” Kotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled</p>\n<p>in with his mustache on end, blowing like a locomotive,</p>\n<p>while Matkah and the seal that was going to marry</p>",
        "<p>Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was a</p>\n<p>gorgeous fight, for the two fought as long as there</p>\n<p>was a seal that dared lift up his head, and</p>\n<p>when there were none they paraded grandly up and down</p>\n<p>the beach side by side, bellowing. At night, just as</p>\n<p>the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through the fog,</p>\n<p>Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the</p>",
        "<p>scattered nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. “Now,” he</p>\n<p>said, “I’ve taught you your lesson.” “My wig!” said old</p>\n<p>Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was fearfully</p>\n<p>mauled. “The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them</p>\n<p>up worse. Son, I’m proud of you, and what’s more,</p>\n<p>I’ll come with you to your island--if there is such</p>\n<p>a place.” “Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who</p>",
        "<p>comes with me to the Sea Cow’s tunnel? Answer, or</p>\n<p>I shall teach you again,” roared Kotick. There was a</p>\n<p>murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and</p>\n<p>down the beaches. “We will come,” said thousands of tired</p>\n<p>voices. “We will follow Kotick, the White Seal.” Then Kotick</p>\n<p>dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes</p>\n<p>proudly. He was not a white seal any more, but</p>",
        "<p>red from head to tail. All the same he would</p>\n<p>have scorned to look at or touch one of his</p>\n<p>wounds. A week later he and his army (nearly ten</p>\n<p>thousand holluschickie and old seals) went away north to the</p>\n<p>Sea Cow’s tunnel, Kotick leading them, and the seals that</p>\n<p>stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next spring, when</p>\n<p>they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific,</p>",
        "<p>Kotick’s seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond</p>\n<p>Sea Cow’s tunnel that more and more seals left Novastoshnah.</p>\n<p>Of course it was not all done at once, for</p>\n<p>the seals are not very clever, and they need a</p>\n<p>long time to turn things over in their minds, but</p>\n<p>year after year more seals went away from Novastoshnah, and</p>\n<p>Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the quiet, sheltered beaches</p>",
        "<p>where Kotick sits all the summer through, getting bigger and</p>\n<p>fatter and stronger each year, while the holluschickie play around</p>\n<p>him, in that sea where no man comes. Lukannon This</p>\n<p>is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul</p>\n<p>seals sing when they are heading back to their beaches</p>\n<p>in the summer. It is a sort of very sad</p>\n<p>seal National Anthem. I met my mates in the morning</p>",
        "<p>(and, oh, but I am old!) Where roaring on the</p>\n<p>ledges the summer ground-swell rolled; I heard them lift the</p>\n<p>chorus that drowned the breakers’ song— The Beaches of Lukannon—two</p>\n<p>million voices strong. _The song of pleasant stations beside the</p>\n<p>salt lagoons, The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down</p>\n<p>the dunes, The song of midnight dances that churned the</p>\n<p>sea to flame— The Beaches of Lukannon—before the sealers came!_</p>",
        "<p>I met my mates in the morning (I’ll never meet</p>\n<p>them more!); They came and went in legions that darkened</p>\n<p>all the shore. And o’er the foam-flecked offing as far</p>\n<p>as voice could reach We hailed the landing-parties and we</p>\n<p>sang them up the beach. _The Beaches of Lukannon—the winter</p>\n<p>wheat so tall— The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog</p>\n<p>drenching all! The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth</p>",
        "<p>and worn! The Beaches of Lukannon—the home where we were</p>\n<p>born!_ I met my mates in the morning, a broken,</p>\n<p>scattered band. Men shoot us in the water and club</p>\n<p>us on the land; Men drive us to the Salt</p>\n<p>House like silly sheep and tame, And still we sing</p>\n<p>Lukannon—before the sealers came. _Wheel down, wheel down to southward;</p>\n<p>oh, Gooverooska, go! And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story</p>",
        "<p>of our woe; Ere, empty as the shark’s egg the</p>\n<p>tempest flings ashore, The Beaches of Lukannon shall know their</p>\n<p>sons no more!_</p>"

        "<h3>“Rikki-Tikki-Tavi”</h3>\n<p>At the hole where he went in Red-Eye called to</p>\n<p>Wrinkle-Skin. Hear what little Red-Eye saith: “Nag, come up and</p>\n<p>dance with death!” Eye to eye and head to head,</p>\n<p>(_Keep the measure, Nag._) This shall end when one is</p>\n<p>dead; (_At thy pleasure, Nag._) Turn for turn and twist</p>\n<p>for twist— (_Run and hide thee, Nag._) Hah! The hooded</p>\n<p>Death has missed! (_Woe betide thee, Nag!_) This is the</p>",
        "<p>story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought single-handed, through</p>\n<p>the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee cantonment. Darzee,</p>\n<p>the Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the muskrat, who never</p>\n<p>comes out into the middle of the floor, but always</p>\n<p>creeps round by the wall, gave him advice, but Rikki-tikki</p>\n<p>did the real fighting. He was a mongoose, rather like</p>\n<p>a little cat in his fur and his tail, but</p>",
        "<p>quite like a weasel in his head and his habits.</p>\n<p>His eyes and the end of his restless nose were</p>\n<p>pink. He could scratch himself anywhere he pleased with any</p>\n<p>leg, front or back, that he chose to use. He</p>\n<p>could fluff up his tail till it looked like a</p>\n<p>bottle brush, and his war cry as he scuttled through</p>\n<p>the long grass was: “Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!” One day, a high summer</p>",
        "<p>flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived</p>\n<p>with his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and</p>\n<p>clucking, down a roadside ditch. He found a little wisp</p>\n<p>of grass floating there, and clung to it till he</p>\n<p>lost his senses. When he revived, he was lying in</p>\n<p>the hot sun on the middle of a garden path,</p>\n<p>very draggled indeed, and a small boy was saying, “Here’s</p>",
        "<p>a dead mongoose. Let’s have a funeral.” “No,” said his</p>\n<p>mother, “let’s take him in and dry him. Perhaps he</p>\n<p>isn’t really dead.” They took him into the house, and</p>\n<p>a big man picked him up between his finger and</p>\n<p>thumb and said he was not dead but half choked.</p>\n<p>So they wrapped him in cotton wool, and warmed him</p>\n<p>over a little fire, and he opened his eyes and</p>",
        "<p>sneezed. “Now,” said the big man (he was an Englishman</p>\n<p>who had just moved into the bungalow), “don’t frighten him,</p>\n<p>and we’ll see what he’ll do.” It is the hardest</p>\n<p>thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because he</p>\n<p>is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The</p>\n<p>motto of all the mongoose family is “Run and find</p>\n<p>out,” and Rikki-tikki was a true mongoose. He looked at</p>",
        "<p>the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to</p>\n<p>eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put</p>\n<p>his fur in order, scratched himself, and jumped on the</p>\n<p>small boy’s shoulder. “Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father.</p>\n<p>“That’s his way of making friends.” “Ouch! He’s tickling under</p>\n<p>my chin,” said Teddy. Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s</p>\n<p>collar and neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down</p>",
        "<p>to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose. “Good</p>\n<p>gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’s a wild creature! I</p>\n<p>suppose he’s so tame because we’ve been kind to him.”</p>\n<p>“All mongooses are like that,” said her husband. “If Teddy</p>\n<p>doesn’t pick him up by the tail, or try to</p>\n<p>put him in a cage, he’ll run in and out</p>\n<p>of the house all day long. Let’s give him something</p>",
        "<p>to eat.” They gave him a little piece of raw</p>\n<p>meat. Rikki-tikki liked it immensely, and when it was finished</p>\n<p>he went out into the veranda and sat in the</p>\n<p>sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry</p>\n<p>to the roots. Then he felt better. “There are more</p>\n<p>things to find out about in this house,” he said</p>\n<p>to himself, “than all my family could find out in</p>",
        "<p>all their lives. I shall certainly stay and find out.”</p>\n<p>He spent all that day roaming over the house. He</p>\n<p>nearly drowned himself in the bath-tubs, put his nose into</p>\n<p>the ink on a writing table, and burned it on</p>\n<p>the end of the big man’s cigar, for he climbed</p>\n<p>up in the big man’s lap to see how writing</p>\n<p>was done. At nightfall he ran into Teddy’s nursery to</p>",
        "<p>watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy went</p>\n<p>to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a</p>\n<p>restless companion, because he had to get up and attend</p>\n<p>to every noise all through the night, and find out</p>\n<p>what made it. Teddy’s mother and father came in, the</p>\n<p>last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was</p>\n<p>awake on the pillow. “I don’t like that,” said Teddy’s</p>",
        "<p>mother. “He may bite the child.” “He’ll do no such</p>\n<p>thing,” said the father. “Teddy’s safer with that little beast</p>\n<p>than if he had a bloodhound to watch him. If</p>\n<p>a snake came into the nursery now--” But Teddy’s mother</p>\n<p>wouldn’t think of anything so awful. Early in the morning</p>\n<p>Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda riding on</p>\n<p>Teddy’s shoulder, and they gave him banana and some boiled</p>",
        "<p>egg. He sat on all their laps one after the</p>\n<p>other, because every well-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a</p>\n<p>house mongoose some day and have rooms to run about</p>\n<p>in; and Rikki-tikki’s mother (she used to live in the</p>\n<p>general’s house at Segowlee) had carefully told Rikki what to</p>\n<p>do if ever he came across white men. Then Rikki-tikki</p>\n<p>went out into the garden to see what was to</p>",
        "<p>be seen. It was a large garden, only half cultivated,</p>\n<p>with bushes, as big as summer-houses, of Marshal Niel roses,</p>\n<p>lime and orange trees, clumps of bamboos, and thickets of</p>\n<p>high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips. “This is a splendid</p>\n<p>hunting-ground,” he said, and his tail grew bottle-brushy at the</p>\n<p>thought of it, and he scuttled up and down the</p>\n<p>garden, snuffing here and there till he heard very sorrowful</p>",
        "<p>voices in a thorn-bush. It was Darzee, the Tailorbird, and</p>\n<p>his wife. They had made a beautiful nest by pulling</p>\n<p>two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges</p>\n<p>with fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and</p>\n<p>downy fluff. The nest swayed to and fro, as they</p>\n<p>sat on the rim and cried. “What is the matter?”</p>\n<p>asked Rikki-tikki. “We are very miserable,” said Darzee. “One of</p>",
        "<p>our babies fell out of the nest yesterday and Nag</p>\n<p>ate him.” “H’m!” said Rikki-tikki, “that is very sad--but I</p>\n<p>am a stranger here. Who is Nag?” Darzee and his</p>\n<p>wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for</p>\n<p>from the thick grass at the foot of the bush</p>\n<p>there came a low hiss--a horrid cold sound that made</p>\n<p>Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then inch by inch</p>",
        "<p>out of the grass rose up the head and spread</p>\n<p>hood of Nag, the big black cobra, and he was</p>\n<p>five feet long from tongue to tail. When he had</p>\n<p>lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground, he stayed</p>\n<p>balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances</p>\n<p>in the wind, and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the</p>\n<p>wicked snake’s eyes that never change their expression, whatever the</p>",
        "<p>snake may be thinking of. “Who is Nag?” said he.</p>\n<p>“I am Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark</p>\n<p>upon all our people, when the first cobra spread his</p>\n<p>hood to keep the sun off Brahm as he slept.</p>\n<p>Look, and be afraid!” He spread out his hood more</p>\n<p>than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the spectacle-mark on the back</p>\n<p>of it that looks exactly like the eye part of</p>",
        "<p>a hook-and-eye fastening. He was afraid for the minute, but</p>\n<p>it is impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for</p>\n<p>any length of time, and though Rikki-tikki had never met</p>\n<p>a live cobra before, his mother had fed him on</p>\n<p>dead ones, and he knew that all a grown mongoose’s</p>\n<p>business in life was to fight and eat snakes. Nag</p>\n<p>knew that too and, at the bottom of his cold</p>",
        "<p>heart, he was afraid. “Well,” said Rikki-tikki, and his tail</p>\n<p>began to fluff up again, “marks or no marks, do</p>\n<p>you think it is right for you to eat fledglings</p>\n<p>out of a nest?” Nag was thinking to himself, and</p>\n<p>watching the least little movement in the grass behind Rikki-tikki.</p>\n<p>He knew that mongooses in the garden meant death sooner</p>\n<p>or later for him and his family, but he wanted</p>",
        "<p>to get Rikki-tikki off his guard. So he dropped his</p>\n<p>head a little, and put it on one side. “Let</p>\n<p>us talk,” he said. “You eat eggs. Why should not</p>\n<p>I eat birds?” “Behind you! Look behind you!” sang Darzee.</p>\n<p>Rikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He</p>\n<p>jumped up in the air as high as he could</p>\n<p>go, and just under him whizzed by the head of</p>",
        "<p>Nagaina, Nag’s wicked wife. She had crept up behind him</p>\n<p>as he was talking, to make an end of him.</p>\n<p>He heard her savage hiss as the stroke missed. He</p>\n<p>came down almost across her back, and if he had</p>\n<p>been an old mongoose he would have known that then</p>\n<p>was the time to break her back with one bite;</p>\n<p>but he was afraid of the terrible lashing return stroke</p>",
        "<p>of the cobra. He bit, indeed, but did not bite</p>\n<p>long enough, and he jumped clear of the whisking tail,</p>\n<p>leaving Nagaina torn and angry. “Wicked, wicked Darzee!” said Nag,</p>\n<p>lashing up as high as he could reach toward the</p>\n<p>nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out</p>\n<p>of reach of snakes, and it only swayed to and</p>\n<p>fro. Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when</p>",
        "<p>a mongoose’s eyes grow red, he is angry), and he</p>\n<p>sat back on his tail and hind legs like a</p>\n<p>little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with</p>\n<p>rage. But Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass.</p>\n<p>When a snake misses its stroke, it never says anything</p>\n<p>or gives any sign of what it means to do</p>\n<p>next. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he</p>",
        "<p>did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes</p>\n<p>at once. So he trotted off to the gravel path</p>\n<p>near the house, and sat down to think. It was</p>\n<p>a serious matter for him. If you read the old</p>\n<p>books of natural history, you will find they say that</p>\n<p>when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get</p>\n<p>bitten, he runs off and eats some herb that cures</p>",
        "<p>him. That is not true. The victory is only a</p>\n<p>matter of quickness of eye and quickness of foot--snake’s blow</p>\n<p>against mongoose’s jump--and as no eye can follow the motion</p>\n<p>of a snake’s head when it strikes, this makes things</p>\n<p>much more wonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he</p>\n<p>was a young mongoose, and it made him all the</p>\n<p>more pleased to think that he had managed to escape</p>",
        "<p>a blow from behind. It gave him confidence in himself,</p>\n<p>and when Teddy came running down the path, Rikki-tikki was</p>\n<p>ready to be petted. But just as Teddy was stooping,</p>\n<p>something wriggled a little in the dust, and a tiny</p>\n<p>voice said: “Be careful. I am Death!” It was Karait,</p>\n<p>the dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the</p>\n<p>dusty earth; and his bite is as dangerous as the</p>",
        "<p>cobra’s. But he is so small that nobody thinks of</p>\n<p>him, and so he does the more harm to people.</p>\n<p>Rikki-tikki’s eyes grew red again, and he danced up to</p>\n<p>Karait with the peculiar rocking, swaying motion that he had</p>\n<p>inherited from his family. It looks very funny, but it</p>\n<p>is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can fly</p>\n<p>off from it at any angle you please, and in</p>",
        "<p>dealing with snakes this is an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had</p>\n<p>only known, he was doing a much more dangerous thing</p>\n<p>than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can</p>\n<p>turn so quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close to</p>\n<p>the back of the head, he would get the return</p>\n<p>stroke in his eye or his lip. But Rikki did</p>\n<p>not know. His eyes were all red, and he rocked</p>",
        "<p>back and forth, looking for a good place to hold.</p>\n<p>Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and tried to run</p>\n<p>in, but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within</p>\n<p>a fraction of his shoulder, and he had to jump</p>\n<p>over the body, and the head followed his heels close.</p>\n<p>Teddy shouted to the house: “Oh, look here! Our mongoose</p>\n<p>is killing a snake.” And Rikki-tikki heard a scream from</p>",
        "<p>Teddy’s mother. His father ran out with a stick, but</p>\n<p>by the time he came up, Karait had lunged out</p>\n<p>once too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the</p>\n<p>snake’s back, dropped his head far between his forelegs, bitten</p>\n<p>as high up the back as he could get hold,</p>\n<p>and rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and Rikki-tikki was</p>\n<p>just going to eat him up from the tail, after</p>",
        "<p>the custom of his family at dinner, when he remembered</p>\n<p>that a full meal makes a slow mongoose, and if</p>\n<p>he wanted all his strength and quickness ready, he must</p>\n<p>keep himself thin. He went away for a dust bath</p>\n<p>under the castor-oil bushes, while Teddy’s father beat the dead</p>\n<p>Karait. “What is the use of that?” thought Rikki-tikki. “I</p>\n<p>have settled it all;” and then Teddy’s mother picked him</p>",
        "<p>up from the dust and hugged him, crying that he</p>\n<p>had saved Teddy from death, and Teddy’s father said that</p>\n<p>he was a providence, and Teddy looked on with big</p>\n<p>scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather amused at all the fuss,</p>\n<p>which, of course, he did not understand. Teddy’s mother might</p>\n<p>just as well have petted Teddy for playing in the</p>\n<p>dust. Rikki was thoroughly enjoying himself. That night at dinner,</p>",
        "<p>walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the table,</p>\n<p>he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice</p>\n<p>things. But he remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it</p>\n<p>was very pleasant to be patted and petted by Teddy’s</p>\n<p>mother, and to sit on Teddy’s shoulder, his eyes would</p>\n<p>get red from time to time, and he would go</p>\n<p>off into his long war cry of “Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!” Teddy carried</p>",
        "<p>him off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping under</p>\n<p>his chin. Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or</p>\n<p>scratch, but as soon as Teddy was asleep he went</p>\n<p>off for his nightly walk round the house, and in</p>\n<p>the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the muskrat, creeping</p>\n<p>around by the wall. Chuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast.</p>\n<p>He whimpers and cheeps all the night, trying to make</p>",
        "<p>up his mind to run into the middle of the</p>\n<p>room. But he never gets there. “Don’t kill me,” said</p>\n<p>Chuchundra, almost weeping. “Rikki-tikki, don’t kill me!” “Do you think</p>\n<p>a snake-killer kills muskrats?” said Rikki-tikki scornfully. “Those who kill</p>\n<p>snakes get killed by snakes,” said Chuchundra, more sorrowfully than</p>\n<p>ever. “And how am I to be sure that Nag</p>\n<p>won’t mistake me for you some dark night?” “There’s not</p>",
        "<p>the least danger,” said Rikki-tikki. “But Nag is in the</p>\n<p>garden, and I know you don’t go there.” “My cousin</p>\n<p>Chua, the rat, told me--” said Chuchundra, and then he</p>\n<p>stopped. “Told you what?” “H’sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You</p>\n<p>should have talked to Chua in the garden.” “I didn’t--so</p>\n<p>you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I’ll bite you!”</p>\n<p>Chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off</p>",
        "<p>his whiskers. “I am a very poor man,” he sobbed.</p>\n<p>“I never had spirit enough to run out into the</p>\n<p>middle of the room. H’sh! I mustn’t tell you anything.</p>\n<p>Can’t you hear, Rikki-tikki?” Rikki-tikki listened. The house was as</p>\n<p>still as still, but he thought he could just catch</p>\n<p>the faintest scratch-scratch in the world--a noise as faint as</p>\n<p>that of a wasp walking on a window-pane--the dry scratch</p>",
        "<p>of a snake’s scales on brick-work. “That’s Nag or Nagaina,”</p>\n<p>he said to himself, “and he is crawling into the</p>\n<p>bath-room sluice. You’re right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to</p>\n<p>Chua.” He stole off to Teddy’s bath-room, but there was</p>\n<p>nothing there, and then to Teddy’s mother’s bathroom. At the</p>\n<p>bottom of the smooth plaster wall there was a brick</p>\n<p>pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water,</p>",
        "<p>and as Rikki-tikki stole in by the masonry curb where</p>\n<p>the bath is put, he heard Nag and Nagaina whispering</p>\n<p>together outside in the moonlight. “When the house is emptied</p>\n<p>of people,” said Nagaina to her husband, “he will have</p>\n<p>to go away, and then the garden will be our</p>\n<p>own again. Go in quietly, and remember that the big</p>\n<p>man who killed Karait is the first one to bite.</p>",
        "<p>Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt</p>\n<p>for Rikki-tikki together.” “But are you sure that there is</p>\n<p>anything to be gained by killing the people?” said Nag.</p>\n<p>“Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did</p>\n<p>we have any mongoose in the garden? So long as</p>\n<p>the bungalow is empty, we are king and queen of</p>\n<p>the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs</p>",
        "<p>in the melon bed hatch (as they may tomorrow), our</p>\n<p>children will need room and quiet.” “I had not thought</p>\n<p>of that,” said Nag. “I will go, but there is</p>\n<p>no need that we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I</p>\n<p>will kill the big man and his wife, and the</p>\n<p>child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the</p>\n<p>bungalow will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go.” Rikki-tikki tingled</p>",
        "<p>all over with rage and hatred at this, and then</p>\n<p>Nag’s head came through the sluice, and his five feet</p>\n<p>of cold body followed it. Angry as he was, Rikki-tikki</p>\n<p>was very frightened as he saw the size of the</p>\n<p>big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his head, and</p>\n<p>looked into the bathroom in the dark, and Rikki could</p>\n<p>see his eyes glitter. “Now, if I kill him here,</p>",
        "<p>Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on the</p>\n<p>open floor, the odds are in his favor. What am</p>\n<p>I to do?” said Rikki-tikki-tavi. Nag waved to and fro,</p>\n<p>and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from the biggest water-jar</p>\n<p>that was used to fill the bath. “That is good,”</p>\n<p>said the snake. “Now, when Karait was killed, the big</p>\n<p>man had a stick. He may have that stick still,</p>",
        "<p>but when he comes in to bathe in the morning</p>\n<p>he will not have a stick. I shall wait here</p>\n<p>till he comes. Nagaina--do you hear me?--I shall wait here</p>\n<p>in the cool till daytime.” There was no answer from</p>\n<p>outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone away. Nag coiled</p>\n<p>himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the</p>\n<p>bottom of the water jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as</p>",
        "<p>death. After an hour he began to move, muscle by</p>\n<p>muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep, and Rikki-tikki looked</p>\n<p>at his big back, wondering which would be the best</p>\n<p>place for a good hold. “If I don’t break his</p>\n<p>back at the first jump,” said Rikki, “he can still</p>\n<p>fight. And if he fights--O Rikki!” He looked at the</p>\n<p>thickness of the neck below the hood, but that was</p>",
        "<p>too much for him; and a bite near the tail</p>\n<p>would only make Nag savage. “It must be the head”’</p>\n<p>he said at last; “the head above the hood. And,</p>\n<p>when I am once there, I must not let go.”</p>\n<p>Then he jumped. The head was lying a little clear</p>\n<p>of the water jar, under the curve of it; and,</p>\n<p>as his teeth met, Rikki braced his back against the</p>",
        "<p>bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head.</p>\n<p>This gave him just one second’s purchase, and he made</p>\n<p>the most of it. Then he was battered to and</p>\n<p>fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and</p>\n<p>fro on the floor, up and down, and around in</p>\n<p>great circles, but his eyes were red and he held</p>\n<p>on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the</p>",
        "<p>tin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush,</p>\n<p>and banged against the tin side of the bath. As</p>\n<p>he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter, for</p>\n<p>he made sure he would be banged to death, and,</p>\n<p>for the honor of his family, he preferred to be</p>\n<p>found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy, aching, and</p>\n<p>felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a</p>",
        "<p>thunderclap just behind him. A hot wind knocked him senseless</p>\n<p>and red fire singed his fur. The big man had</p>\n<p>been wakened by the noise, and had fired both barrels</p>\n<p>of a shotgun into Nag just behind the hood. Rikki-tikki</p>\n<p>held on with his eyes shut, for now he was</p>\n<p>quite sure he was dead. But the head did not</p>\n<p>move, and the big man picked him up and said,</p>",
        "<p>“It’s the mongoose again, Alice. The little chap has saved</p>\n<p>our lives now.” Then Teddy’s mother came in with a</p>\n<p>very white face, and saw what was left of Nag,</p>\n<p>and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddy’s bedroom and spent half</p>\n<p>the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find</p>\n<p>out whether he really was broken into forty pieces, as</p>\n<p>he fancied. When morning came he was very stiff, but</p>",
        "<p>well pleased with his doings. “Now I have Nagaina to</p>\n<p>settle with, and she will be worse than five Nags,</p>\n<p>and there’s no knowing when the eggs she spoke of</p>\n<p>will hatch. Goodness! I must go and see Darzee,” he</p>\n<p>said. Without waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush</p>\n<p>where Darzee was singing a song of triumph at the</p>\n<p>top of his voice. The news of Nag’s death was</p>",
        "<p>all over the garden, for the sweeper had thrown the</p>\n<p>body on the rubbish-heap. “Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers!”</p>\n<p>said Rikki-tikki angrily. “Is this the time to sing?” “Nag</p>\n<p>is dead--is dead--is dead!” sang Darzee. “The valiant Rikki-tikki caught</p>\n<p>him by the head and held fast. The big man</p>\n<p>brought the bang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He</p>\n<p>will never eat my babies again.” “All that’s true enough.</p>",
        "<p>But where’s Nagaina?” said Rikki-tikki, looking carefully round him. “Nagaina</p>\n<p>came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag,” Darzee</p>\n<p>went on, “and Nag came out on the end of</p>\n<p>a stick--the sweeper picked him up on the end of</p>\n<p>a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap. Let</p>\n<p>us sing about the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!” And Darzee</p>\n<p>filled his throat and sang. “If I could get up</p>",
        "<p>to your nest, I’d roll your babies out!” said Rikki-tikki.</p>\n<p>“You don’t know when to do the right thing at</p>\n<p>the right time. You’re safe enough in your nest there,</p>\n<p>but it’s war for me down here. Stop singing a</p>\n<p>minute, Darzee.” “For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki’s sake I</p>\n<p>will stop,” said Darzee. “What is it, O Killer of</p>\n<p>the terrible Nag?” “Where is Nagaina, for the third time?”</p>",
        "<p>“On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag.</p>\n<p>Great is Rikki-tikki with the white teeth.” “Bother my white</p>\n<p>teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?”</p>\n<p>“In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall,</p>\n<p>where the sun strikes nearly all day. She hid them</p>\n<p>there weeks ago.” “And you never thought it worth while</p>\n<p>to tell me? The end nearest the wall, you said?”</p>",
        "<p>“Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?” “Not</p>\n<p>eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of</p>\n<p>sense you will fly off to the stables and pretend</p>\n<p>that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina chase you</p>\n<p>away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed,</p>\n<p>and if I went there now she’d see me.” Darzee</p>\n<p>was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more</p>",
        "<p>than one idea at a time in his head. And</p>\n<p>just because he knew that Nagaina’s children were born in</p>\n<p>eggs like his own, he didn’t think at first that</p>\n<p>it was fair to kill them. But his wife was</p>\n<p>a sensible bird, and she knew that cobra’s eggs meant</p>\n<p>young cobras later on. So she flew off from the</p>\n<p>nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and</p>",
        "<p>continue his song about the death of Nag. Darzee was</p>\n<p>very like a man in some ways. She fluttered in</p>\n<p>front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out,</p>\n<p>“Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house</p>\n<p>threw a stone at me and broke it.” Then she</p>\n<p>fluttered more desperately than ever. Nagaina lifted up her head</p>\n<p>and hissed, “You warned Rikki-tikki when I would have killed</p>",
        "<p>him. Indeed and truly, you’ve chosen a bad place to</p>\n<p>be lame in.” And she moved toward Darzee’s wife, slipping</p>\n<p>along over the dust. “The boy broke it with a</p>\n<p>stone!” shrieked Darzee’s wife. “Well! It may be some consolation</p>\n<p>to you when you’re dead to know that I shall</p>\n<p>settle accounts with the boy. My husband lies on the</p>\n<p>rubbish heap this morning, but before night the boy in</p>",
        "<p>the house will lie very still. What is the use</p>\n<p>of running away? I am sure to catch you. Little</p>\n<p>fool, look at me!” Darzee’s wife knew better than to</p>\n<p>do that, for a bird who looks at a snake’s</p>\n<p>eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzee’s wife</p>\n<p>fluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and</p>\n<p>Nagaina quickened her pace. Rikki-tikki heard them going up the</p>",
        "<p>path from the stables, and he raced for the end</p>\n<p>of the melon patch near the wall. There, in the</p>\n<p>warm litter above the melons, very cunningly hidden, he found</p>\n<p>twenty-five eggs, about the size of a bantam’s eggs, but</p>\n<p>with whitish skin instead of shell. “I was not a</p>\n<p>day too soon,” he said, for he could see the</p>\n<p>baby cobras curled up inside the skin, and he knew</p>",
        "<p>that the minute they were hatched they could each kill</p>\n<p>a man or a mongoose. He bit off the tops</p>\n<p>of the eggs as fast as he could, taking care</p>\n<p>to crush the young cobras, and turned over the litter</p>\n<p>from time to time to see whether he had missed</p>\n<p>any. At last there were only three eggs left, and</p>\n<p>Rikki-tikki began to chuckle to himself, when he heard Darzee’s</p>",
        "<p>wife screaming: “Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and</p>\n<p>she has gone into the veranda, and--oh, come quickly--she means</p>\n<p>killing!” Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the</p>\n<p>melon-bed with the third egg in his mouth, and scuttled</p>\n<p>to the veranda as hard as he could put foot</p>\n<p>to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were</p>\n<p>there at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were</p>",
        "<p>not eating anything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were</p>\n<p>white. Nagaina was coiled up on the matting by Teddy’s</p>\n<p>chair, within easy striking distance of Teddy’s bare leg, and</p>\n<p>she was swaying to and fro, singing a song of</p>\n<p>triumph. “Son of the big man that killed Nag,” she</p>\n<p>hissed, “stay still. I am not ready yet. Wait a</p>\n<p>little. Keep very still, all you three! If you move</p>",
        "<p>I strike, and if you do not move I strike.</p>\n<p>Oh, foolish people, who killed my Nag!” Teddy’s eyes were</p>\n<p>fixed on his father, and all his father could do</p>\n<p>was to whisper, “Sit still, Teddy. You mustn’t move. Teddy,</p>\n<p>keep still.” Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, “Turn round,</p>\n<p>Nagaina. Turn and fight!” “All in good time,” said she,</p>\n<p>without moving her eyes. “I will settle my account with</p>",
        "<p>you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are still</p>\n<p>and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and</p>\n<p>if you come a step nearer I strike.” “Look at</p>\n<p>your eggs,” said Rikki-tikki, “in the melon bed near the</p>\n<p>wall. Go and look, Nagaina!” The big snake turned half</p>\n<p>around, and saw the egg on the veranda. “Ah-h! Give</p>\n<p>it to me,” she said. Rikki-tikki put his paws one</p>",
        "<p>on each side of the egg, and his eyes were</p>\n<p>blood-red. “What price for a snake’s egg? For a young</p>\n<p>cobra? For a young king cobra? For the last--the very</p>\n<p>last of the brood? The ants are eating all the</p>\n<p>others down by the melon bed.” Nagaina spun clear round,</p>\n<p>forgetting everything for the sake of the one egg. Rikki-tikki</p>\n<p>saw Teddy’s father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy</p>",
        "<p>by the shoulder, and drag him across the little table</p>\n<p>with the tea-cups, safe and out of reach of Nagaina.</p>\n<p>“Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!” chuckled Rikki-tikki. “The boy is safe,</p>\n<p>and it was I--I--I that caught Nag by the hood</p>\n<p>last night in the bathroom.” Then he began to jump</p>\n<p>up and down, all four feet together, his head close</p>\n<p>to the floor. “He threw me to and fro, but</p>",
        "<p>he could not shake me off. He was dead before</p>\n<p>the big man blew him in two. I did it!</p>\n<p>Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with me. You</p>\n<p>shall not be a widow long.” Nagaina saw that she</p>\n<p>had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg</p>\n<p>lay between Rikki-tikki’s paws. “Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give</p>\n<p>me the last of my eggs, and I will go</p>",
        "<p>away and never come back,” she said, lowering her hood.</p>\n<p>“Yes, you will go away, and you will never come</p>\n<p>back. For you will go to the rubbish heap with</p>\n<p>Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his</p>\n<p>gun! Fight!” Rikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just</p>\n<p>out of reach of her stroke, his little eyes like</p>\n<p>hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself together and flung out at</p>",
        "<p>him. Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward. Again and again and</p>\n<p>again she struck, and each time her head came with</p>\n<p>a whack on the matting of the veranda and she</p>\n<p>gathered herself together like a watch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced</p>\n<p>in a circle to get behind her, and Nagaina spun</p>\n<p>round to keep her head to his head, so that</p>\n<p>the rustle of her tail on the matting sounded like</p>",
        "<p>dry leaves blown along by the wind. He had forgotten</p>\n<p>the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina</p>\n<p>came nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while</p>\n<p>Rikki-tikki was drawing breath, she caught it in her mouth,</p>\n<p>turned to the veranda steps, and flew like an arrow</p>\n<p>down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When the cobra</p>\n<p>runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked</p>",
        "<p>across a horse’s neck. Rikki-tikki knew that he must catch</p>\n<p>her, or all the trouble would begin again. She headed</p>\n<p>straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as</p>\n<p>he was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish</p>\n<p>little song of triumph. But Darzee’s wife was wiser. She</p>\n<p>flew off her nest as Nagaina came along, and flapped</p>\n<p>her wings about Nagaina’s head. If Darzee had helped they</p>",
        "<p>might have turned her, but Nagaina only lowered her hood</p>\n<p>and went on. Still, the instant’s delay brought Rikki-tikki up</p>\n<p>to her, and as she plunged into the rat-hole where</p>\n<p>she and Nag used to live, his little white teeth</p>\n<p>were clenched on her tail, and he went down with</p>\n<p>her--and very few mongooses, however wise and old they may</p>\n<p>be, care to follow a cobra into its hole. It</p>",
        "<p>was dark in the hole; and Rikki-tikki never knew when</p>\n<p>it might open out and give Nagaina room to turn</p>\n<p>and strike at him. He held on savagely, and stuck</p>\n<p>out his feet to act as brakes on the dark</p>\n<p>slope of the hot, moist earth. Then the grass by</p>\n<p>the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said,</p>\n<p>“It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his</p>",
        "<p>death song. Valiant Rikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely</p>\n<p>kill him underground.” So he sang a very mournful song</p>\n<p>that he made up on the spur of the minute,</p>\n<p>and just as he got to the most touching part,</p>\n<p>the grass quivered again, and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged</p>\n<p>himself out of the hole leg by leg, licking his</p>\n<p>whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little shout. Rikki-tikki shook some</p>",
        "<p>of the dust out of his fur and sneezed. “It</p>\n<p>is all over,” he said. “The widow will never come</p>\n<p>out again.” And the red ants that live between the</p>\n<p>grass stems heard him, and began to troop down one</p>\n<p>after another to see if he had spoken the truth.</p>\n<p>Rikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where</p>\n<p>he was--slept and slept till it was late in the</p>",
        "<p>afternoon, for he had done a hard day’s work. “Now,”</p>\n<p>he said, when he awoke, “I will go back to</p>\n<p>the house. Tell the Coppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell</p>\n<p>the garden that Nagaina is dead.” The Coppersmith is a</p>\n<p>bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of</p>\n<p>a little hammer on a copper pot; and the reason</p>\n<p>he is always making it is because he is the</p>",
        "<p>town crier to every Indian garden, and tells all the</p>\n<p>news to everybody who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki went</p>\n<p>up the path, he heard his “attention” notes like a</p>\n<p>tiny dinner gong, and then the steady “Ding-dong-tock! Nag is</p>\n<p>dead--dong! Nagaina is dead! Ding-dong-tock!” That set all the birds</p>\n<p>in the garden singing, and the frogs croaking, for Nag</p>\n<p>and Nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little</p>",
        "<p>birds. When Rikki got to the house, Teddy and Teddy’s</p>\n<p>mother (she looked very white still, for she had been</p>\n<p>fainting) and Teddy’s father came out and almost cried over</p>\n<p>him; and that night he ate all that was given</p>\n<p>him till he could eat no more, and went to</p>\n<p>bed on Teddy’s shoulder, where Teddy’s mother saw him when</p>\n<p>she came to look late at night. “He saved our</p>",
        "<p>lives and Teddy’s life,” she said to her husband. “Just</p>\n<p>think, he saved all our lives.” Rikki-tikki woke up with</p>\n<p>a jump, for the mongooses are light sleepers. “Oh, it’s</p>\n<p>you,” said he. “What are you bothering for? All the</p>\n<p>cobras are dead. And if they weren’t, I’m here.” Rikki-tikki</p>\n<p>had a right to be proud of himself. But he</p>\n<p>did not grow too proud, and he kept that garden</p>",
        "<p>as a mongoose should keep it, with tooth and jump</p>\n<p>and spring and bite, till never a cobra dared show</p>\n<p>its head inside the walls. Darzee’s Chant (Sung in honor</p>\n<p>of Rikki-tikki-tavi) Singer and tailor am I-- Doubled the joys</p>\n<p>that I know-- Proud of my lilt to the sky,</p>\n<p>Proud of the house that I sew-- Over and under,</p>\n<p>so weave I my music--so weave I the house that</p>",
        "<p>I sew. Sing to your fledglings again, Mother, oh lift</p>\n<p>up your head! Evil that plagued us is slain, Death</p>\n<p>in the garden lies dead. Terror that hid in the</p>\n<p>roses is impotent--flung on the dung-hill and dead! Who has</p>\n<p>delivered us, who? Tell me his nest and his name.</p>\n<p>Rikki, the valiant, the true, Tikki, with eyeballs of flame,</p>\n<p>Rikk-tikki-tikki, the ivory-fanged, the hunter with eyeballs of flame! Give</p>",
        "<p>him the Thanks of the Birds, Bowing with tail feathers</p>\n<p>spread! Praise him with nightingale words-- Nay, I will praise</p>\n<p>him instead. Hear! I will sing you the praise of</p>\n<p>the bottle-tailed Rikki, with eyeballs of red! (_Here Rikki-tikki interrupted,</p>\n<p>and the rest of the song is lost._)</p>",
        "<h3>Toomai of the Elephants</h3>\n<p>I will remember what I was, I am sick of</p>\n<p>rope and chain-- I will remember my old strength and</p>\n<p>all my forest affairs. I will not sell my back</p>\n<p>to man for a bundle of sugar-cane: I will go</p>\n<p>out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their</p>\n<p>lairs. I will go out until the day, until the</p>\n<p>morning break-- Out to the wind’s untainted kiss, the water’s</p>",
        "<p>clean caress; I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my</p>\n<p>picket stake. I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates</p>\n<p>masterless! Kala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the</p>\n<p>Indian Government in every way that an elephant could serve</p>\n<p>it for forty-seven years, and as he was fully twenty</p>\n<p>years old when he was caught, that makes him nearly</p>\n<p>seventy--a ripe age for an elephant. He remembered pushing, with</p>",
        "<p>a big leather pad on his forehead, at a gun</p>\n<p>stuck in deep mud, and that was before the Afghan</p>\n<p>War of 1842, and he had not then come to</p>\n<p>his full strength. His mother Radha Pyari,--Radha the darling,--who had</p>\n<p>been caught in the same drive with Kala Nag, told</p>\n<p>him, before his little milk tusks had dropped out, that</p>\n<p>elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag knew</p>",
        "<p>that that advice was good, for the first time that</p>\n<p>he saw a shell burst he backed, screaming, into a</p>\n<p>stand of piled rifles, and the bayonets pricked him in</p>\n<p>all his softest places. So, before he was twenty-five, he</p>\n<p>gave up being afraid, and so he was the best-loved</p>\n<p>and the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government</p>\n<p>of India. He had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds’ weight</p>",
        "<p>of tents, on the march in Upper India. He had</p>\n<p>been hoisted into a ship at the end of a</p>\n<p>steam crane and taken for days across the water, and</p>\n<p>made to carry a mortar on his back in a</p>\n<p>strange and rocky country very far from India, and had</p>\n<p>seen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had</p>\n<p>come back again in the steamer entitled, so the soldiers</p>",
        "<p>said, to the Abyssinian War medal. He had seen his</p>\n<p>fellow elephants die of cold and epilepsy and starvation and</p>\n<p>sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid, ten years</p>\n<p>later; and afterward he had been sent down thousands of</p>\n<p>miles south to haul and pile big balks of teak</p>\n<p>in the timberyards at Moulmein. There he had half killed</p>\n<p>an insubordinate young elephant who was shirking his fair share</p>",
        "<p>of work. After that he was taken off timber-hauling, and</p>\n<p>employed, with a few score other elephants who were trained</p>\n<p>to the business, in helping to catch wild elephants among</p>\n<p>the Garo hills. Elephants are very strictly preserved by the</p>\n<p>Indian Government. There is one whole department which does nothing</p>\n<p>else but hunt them, and catch them, and break them</p>\n<p>in, and send them up and down the country as</p>",
        "<p>they are needed for work. Kala Nag stood ten fair</p>\n<p>feet at the shoulders, and his tusks had been cut</p>\n<p>off short at five feet, and bound round the ends,</p>\n<p>to prevent them splitting, with bands of copper; but he</p>\n<p>could do more with those stumps than any untrained elephant</p>\n<p>could do with the real sharpened ones. When, after weeks</p>\n<p>and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across the</p>",
        "<p>hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into</p>\n<p>the last stockade, and the big drop gate, made of</p>\n<p>tree trunks lashed together, jarred down behind them, Kala Nag,</p>\n<p>at the word of command, would go into that flaring,</p>\n<p>trumpeting pandemonium (generally at night, when the flicker of the</p>\n<p>torches made it difficult to judge distances), and, picking out</p>\n<p>the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer</p>",
        "<p>him and hustle him into quiet while the men on</p>\n<p>the backs of the other elephants roped and tied the</p>\n<p>smaller ones. There was nothing in the way of fighting</p>\n<p>that Kala Nag, the old wise Black Snake, did not</p>\n<p>know, for he had stood up more than once in</p>\n<p>his time to the charge of the wounded tiger, and,</p>\n<p>curling up his soft trunk to be out of harm’s</p>",
        "<p>way, had knocked the springing brute sideways in mid-air with</p>\n<p>a quick sickle cut of his head, that he had</p>\n<p>invented all by himself; had knocked him over, and kneeled</p>\n<p>upon him with his huge knees till the life went</p>\n<p>out with a gasp and a howl, and there was</p>\n<p>only a fluffy striped thing on the ground for Kala</p>\n<p>Nag to pull by the tail. “Yes,” said Big Toomai,</p>",
        "<p>his driver, the son of Black Toomai who had taken</p>\n<p>him to Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants</p>\n<p>who had seen him caught, “there is nothing that the</p>\n<p>Black Snake fears except me. He has seen three generations</p>\n<p>of us feed him and groom him, and he will</p>\n<p>live to see four.” “He is afraid of me also,”</p>\n<p>said Little Toomai, standing up to his full height of</p>",
        "<p>four feet, with only one rag upon him. He was</p>\n<p>ten years old, the eldest son of Big Toomai, and,</p>\n<p>according to custom, he would take his father’s place on</p>\n<p>Kala Nag’s neck when he grew up, and would handle</p>\n<p>the heavy iron ankus, the elephant goad, that had been</p>\n<p>worn smooth by his father, and his grandfather, and his</p>\n<p>great-grandfather. He knew what he was talking of; for he</p>",
        "<p>had been born under Kala Nag’s shadow, had played with</p>\n<p>the end of his trunk before he could walk, had</p>\n<p>taken him down to water as soon as he could</p>\n<p>walk, and Kala Nag would no more have dreamed of</p>\n<p>disobeying his shrill little orders than he would have dreamed</p>\n<p>of killing him on that day when Big Toomai carried</p>\n<p>the little brown baby under Kala Nag’s tusks, and told</p>",
        "<p>him to salute his master that was to be. “Yes,”</p>\n<p>said Little Toomai, “he is afraid of me,” and he</p>\n<p>took long strides up to Kala Nag, called him a</p>\n<p>fat old pig, and made him lift up his feet</p>\n<p>one after the other. “Wah!” said Little Toomai, “thou art</p>\n<p>a big elephant,” and he wagged his fluffy head, quoting</p>\n<p>his father. “The Government may pay for elephants, but they</p>",
        "<p>belong to us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag,</p>\n<p>there will come some rich rajah, and he will buy</p>\n<p>thee from the Government, on account of thy size and</p>\n<p>thy manners, and then thou wilt have nothing to do</p>\n<p>but to carry gold earrings in thy ears, and a</p>\n<p>gold howdah on thy back, and a red cloth covered</p>\n<p>with gold on thy sides, and walk at the head</p>",
        "<p>of the processions of the King. Then I shall sit</p>\n<p>on thy neck, O Kala Nag, with a silver ankus,</p>\n<p>and men will run before us with golden sticks, crying,</p>\n<p>`Room for the King’s elephant!’ That will be good, Kala</p>\n<p>Nag, but not so good as this hunting in the</p>\n<p>jungles.” “Umph!” said Big Toomai. “Thou art a boy, and</p>\n<p>as wild as a buffalo-calf. This running up and down</p>",
        "<p>among the hills is not the best Government service. I</p>\n<p>am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants.</p>\n<p>Give me brick elephant lines, one stall to each elephant,</p>\n<p>and big stumps to tie them to safely, and flat,</p>\n<p>broad roads to exercise upon, instead of this come-and-go camping.</p>\n<p>Aha, the Cawnpore barracks were good. There was a bazaar</p>\n<p>close by, and only three hours’ work a day.” Little</p>",
        "<p>Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing. He very</p>\n<p>much preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat</p>\n<p>roads, with the daily grubbing for grass in the forage</p>\n<p>reserve, and the long hours when there was nothing to</p>\n<p>do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in his pickets.</p>\n<p>What Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths</p>\n<p>that only an elephant could take; the dip into the</p>",
        "<p>valley below; the glimpses of the wild elephants browsing miles</p>\n<p>away; the rush of the frightened pig and peacock under</p>\n<p>Kala Nag’s feet; the blinding warm rains, when all the</p>\n<p>hills and valleys smoked; the beautiful misty mornings when nobody</p>\n<p>knew where they would camp that night; the steady, cautious</p>\n<p>drive of the wild elephants, and the mad rush and</p>\n<p>blaze and hullabaloo of the last night’s drive, when the</p>",
        "<p>elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a landslide,</p>\n<p>found that they could not get out, and flung themselves</p>\n<p>at the heavy posts only to be driven back by</p>\n<p>yells and flaring torches and volleys of blank cartridge. Even</p>\n<p>a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai</p>\n<p>was as useful as three boys. He would get his</p>\n<p>torch and wave it, and yell with the best. But</p>",
        "<p>the really good time came when the driving out began,</p>\n<p>and the Keddah--that is, the stockade--looked like a picture of</p>\n<p>the end of the world, and men had to make</p>\n<p>signs to one another, because they could not hear themselves</p>\n<p>speak. Then Little Toomai would climb up to the top</p>\n<p>of one of the quivering stockade posts, his sun-bleached brown</p>\n<p>hair flying loose all over his shoulders, and he looking</p>",
        "<p>like a goblin in the torch-light. And as soon as</p>\n<p>there was a lull you could hear his high-pitched yells</p>\n<p>of encouragement to Kala Nag, above the trumpeting and crashing,</p>\n<p>and snapping of ropes, and groans of the tethered elephants.</p>\n<p>“Mael, mael, Kala Nag! (Go on, go on, Black Snake!)</p>\n<p>Dant do! (Give him the tusk!) Somalo! Somalo! (Careful, careful!)</p>\n<p>Maro! Mar! (Hit him, hit him!) Mind the post! Arre!</p>",
        "<p>Arre! Hai! Yai! Kya-a-ah!” he would shout, and the big</p>\n<p>fight between Kala Nag and the wild elephant would sway</p>\n<p>to and fro across the Keddah, and the old elephant</p>\n<p>catchers would wipe the sweat out of their eyes, and</p>\n<p>find time to nod to Little Toomai wriggling with joy</p>\n<p>on the top of the posts. He did more than</p>\n<p>wriggle. One night he slid down from the post and</p>",
        "<p>slipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose</p>\n<p>end of a rope, which had dropped, to a driver</p>\n<p>who was trying to get a purchase on the leg</p>\n<p>of a kicking young calf (calves always give more trouble</p>\n<p>than full-grown animals). Kala Nag saw him, caught him in</p>\n<p>his trunk, and handed him up to Big Toomai, who</p>\n<p>slapped him then and there, and put him back on</p>",
        "<p>the post. Next morning he gave him a scolding and</p>\n<p>said, “Are not good brick elephant lines and a little</p>\n<p>tent carrying enough, that thou must needs go elephant catching</p>\n<p>on thy own account, little worthless? Now those foolish hunters,</p>\n<p>whose pay is less than my pay, have spoken to</p>\n<p>Petersen Sahib of the matter.” Little Toomai was frightened. He</p>\n<p>did not know much of white men, but Petersen Sahib</p>",
        "<p>was the greatest white man in the world to him.</p>\n<p>He was the head of all the Keddah operations--the man</p>\n<p>who caught all the elephants for the Government of India,</p>\n<p>and who knew more about the ways of elephants than</p>\n<p>any living man. “What--what will happen?” said Little Toomai. “Happen!</p>\n<p>The worst that can happen. Petersen Sahib is a madman.</p>\n<p>Else why should he go hunting these wild devils? He</p>",
        "<p>may even require thee to be an elephant catcher, to</p>\n<p>sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles, and at last to</p>\n<p>be trampled to death in the Keddah. It is well</p>\n<p>that this nonsense ends safely. Next week the catching is</p>\n<p>over, and we of the plains are sent back to</p>\n<p>our stations. Then we will march on smooth roads, and</p>\n<p>forget all this hunting. But, son, I am angry that</p>",
        "<p>thou shouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these</p>\n<p>dirty Assamese jungle folk. Kala Nag will obey none but</p>\n<p>me, so I must go with him into the Keddah,</p>\n<p>but he is only a fighting elephant, and he does</p>\n<p>not help to rope them. So I sit at my</p>\n<p>ease, as befits a mahout,--not a mere hunter,--a mahout, I</p>\n<p>say, and a man who gets a pension at the</p>",
        "<p>end of his service. Is the family of Toomai of</p>\n<p>the Elephants to be trodden underfoot in the dirt of</p>\n<p>a Keddah? Bad one! Wicked one! Worthless son! Go and</p>\n<p>wash Kala Nag and attend to his ears, and see</p>\n<p>that there are no thorns in his feet. Or else</p>\n<p>Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and make thee a</p>\n<p>wild hunter--a follower of elephant’s foot tracks, a jungle bear.</p>",
        "<p>Bah! Shame! Go!” Little Toomai went off without saying a</p>\n<p>word, but he told Kala Nag all his grievances while</p>\n<p>he was examining his feet. “No matter,” said Little Toomai,</p>\n<p>turning up the fringe of Kala Nag’s huge right ear.</p>\n<p>“They have said my name to Petersen Sahib, and perhaps--and</p>\n<p>perhaps--and perhaps--who knows? Hai! That is a big thorn that</p>\n<p>I have pulled out!” The next few days were spent</p>",
        "<p>in getting the elephants together, in walking the newly caught</p>\n<p>wild elephants up and down between a couple of tame</p>\n<p>ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the</p>\n<p>downward march to the plains, and in taking stock of</p>\n<p>the blankets and ropes and things that had been worn</p>\n<p>out or lost in the forest. Petersen Sahib came in</p>\n<p>on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been paying off</p>",
        "<p>other camps among the hills, for the season was coming</p>\n<p>to an end, and there was a native clerk sitting</p>\n<p>at a table under a tree, to pay the drivers</p>\n<p>their wages. As each man was paid he went back</p>\n<p>to his elephant, and joined the line that stood ready</p>\n<p>to start. The catchers, and hunters, and beaters, the men</p>\n<p>of the regular Keddah, who stayed in the jungle year</p>",
        "<p>in and year out, sat on the backs of the</p>\n<p>elephants that belonged to Petersen Sahib’s permanent force, or leaned</p>\n<p>against the trees with their guns across their arms, and</p>\n<p>made fun of the drivers who were going away, and</p>\n<p>laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the line and</p>\n<p>ran about. Big Toomai went up to the clerk with</p>\n<p>Little Toomai behind him, and Machua Appa, the head tracker,</p>",
        "<p>said in an undertone to a friend of his, “There</p>\n<p>goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least. ’Tis</p>\n<p>a pity to send that young jungle-cock to molt in</p>\n<p>the plains.” Now Petersen Sahib had ears all over him,</p>\n<p>as a man must have who listens to the most</p>\n<p>silent of all living things--the wild elephant. He turned where</p>\n<p>he was lying all along on Pudmini’s back and said,</p>",
        "<p>“What is that? I did not know of a man</p>\n<p>among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to rope even</p>\n<p>a dead elephant.” “This is not a man, but a</p>\n<p>boy. He went into the Keddah at the last drive,</p>\n<p>and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying</p>\n<p>to get that young calf with the blotch on his</p>\n<p>shoulder away from his mother.” Machua Appa pointed at Little</p>",
        "<p>Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and Little Toomai bowed to</p>\n<p>the earth. “He throw a rope? He is smaller than</p>\n<p>a picket-pin. Little one, what is thy name?” said Petersen</p>\n<p>Sahib. Little Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala</p>\n<p>Nag was behind him, and Toomai made a sign with</p>\n<p>his hand, and the elephant caught him up in his</p>\n<p>trunk and held him level with Pudmini’s forehead, in front</p>",
        "<p>of the great Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his</p>\n<p>face with his hands, for he was only a child,</p>\n<p>and except where elephants were concerned, he was just as</p>\n<p>bashful as a child could be. “Oho!” said Petersen Sahib,</p>\n<p>smiling underneath his mustache, “and why didst thou teach thy</p>\n<p>elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal green</p>\n<p>corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears</p>",
        "<p>are put out to dry?” “Not green corn, Protector of</p>\n<p>the Poor,--melons,” said Little Toomai, and all the men sitting</p>\n<p>about broke into a roar of laughter. Most of them</p>\n<p>had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys.</p>\n<p>Little Toomai was hanging eight feet up in the air,</p>\n<p>and he wished very much that he were eight feet</p>\n<p>underground. “He is Toomai, my son, Sahib,” said Big Toomai,</p>",
        "<p>scowling. “He is a very bad boy, and he will</p>\n<p>end in a jail, Sahib.” “Of that I have my</p>\n<p>doubts,” said Petersen Sahib. “A boy who can face a</p>\n<p>full Keddah at his age does not end in jails.</p>\n<p>See, little one, here are four annas to spend in</p>\n<p>sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under that great</p>\n<p>thatch of hair. In time thou mayest become a hunter</p>",
        "<p>too.” Big Toomai scowled more than ever. “Remember, though, that</p>\n<p>Keddahs are not good for children to play in,” Petersen</p>\n<p>Sahib went on. “Must I never go there, Sahib?” asked</p>\n<p>Little Toomai with a big gasp. “Yes.” Petersen Sahib smiled</p>\n<p>again. “When thou hast seen the elephants dance. That is</p>\n<p>the proper time. Come to me when thou hast seen</p>\n<p>the elephants dance, and then I will let thee go</p>",
        "<p>into all the Keddahs.” There was another roar of laughter,</p>\n<p>for that is an old joke among elephant-catchers, and it</p>\n<p>means just never. There are great cleared flat places hidden</p>\n<p>away in the forests that are called elephants’ ball-rooms, but</p>\n<p>even these are only found by accident, and no man</p>\n<p>has ever seen the elephants dance. When a driver boasts</p>\n<p>of his skill and bravery the other drivers say, “And</p>",
        "<p>when didst thou see the elephants dance?” Kala Nag put</p>\n<p>Little Toomai down, and he bowed to the earth again</p>\n<p>and went away with his father, and gave the silver</p>\n<p>four-anna piece to his mother, who was nursing his baby</p>\n<p>brother, and they all were put up on Kala Nag’s</p>\n<p>back, and the line of grunting, squealing elephants rolled down</p>\n<p>the hill path to the plains. It was a very</p>",
        "<p>lively march on account of the new elephants, who gave</p>\n<p>trouble at every ford, and needed coaxing or beating every</p>\n<p>other minute. Big Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he</p>\n<p>was very angry, but Little Toomai was too happy to</p>\n<p>speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him, and given him money,</p>\n<p>so he felt as a private soldier would feel if</p>\n<p>he had been called out of the ranks and praised</p>",
        "<p>by his commander-in-chief. “What did Petersen Sahib mean by the</p>\n<p>elephant dance?” he said, at last, softly to his mother.</p>\n<p>Big Toomai heard him and grunted. “That thou shouldst never</p>\n<p>be one of these hill buffaloes of trackers. That was</p>\n<p>what he meant. Oh, you in front, what is blocking</p>\n<p>the way?” An Assamese driver, two or three elephants ahead,</p>\n<p>turned round angrily, crying: “Bring up Kala Nag, and knock</p>",
        "<p>this youngster of mine into good behavior. Why should Petersen</p>\n<p>Sahib have chosen me to go down with you donkeys</p>\n<p>of the rice fields? Lay your beast alongside, Toomai, and</p>\n<p>let him prod with his tusks. By all the Gods</p>\n<p>of the Hills, these new elephants are possessed, or else</p>\n<p>they can smell their companions in the jungle.” Kala Nag</p>\n<p>hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the</p>",
        "<p>wind out of him, as Big Toomai said, “We have</p>\n<p>swept the hills of wild elephants at the last catch.</p>\n<p>It is only your carelessness in driving. Must I keep</p>\n<p>order along the whole line?” “Hear him!” said the other</p>\n<p>driver. “We have swept the hills! Ho! Ho! You are</p>\n<p>very wise, you plains people. Anyone but a mud-head who</p>\n<p>never saw the jungle would know that they know that</p>",
        "<p>the drives are ended for the season. Therefore all the</p>\n<p>wild elephants to-night will--but why should I waste wisdom on</p>\n<p>a river-turtle?” “What will they do?” Little Toomai called out.</p>\n<p>“Ohe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I will tell</p>\n<p>thee, for thou hast a cool head. They will dance,</p>\n<p>and it behooves thy father, who has swept all the</p>\n<p>hills of all the elephants, to double-chain his pickets to-night.”</p>",
        "<p>“What talk is this?” said Big Toomai. “For forty years,</p>\n<p>father and son, we have tended elephants, and we have</p>\n<p>never heard such moonshine about dances.” “Yes; but a plainsman</p>\n<p>who lives in a hut knows only the four walls</p>\n<p>of his hut. Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and</p>\n<p>see what comes. As for their dancing, I have seen</p>\n<p>the place where--Bapree-bap! How many windings has the Dihang River?</p>",
        "<p>Here is another ford, and we must swim the calves.</p>\n<p>Stop still, you behind there.” And in this way, talking</p>\n<p>and wrangling and splashing through the rivers, they made their</p>\n<p>first march to a sort of receiving camp for the</p>\n<p>new elephants. But they lost their tempers long before they</p>\n<p>got there. Then the elephants were chained by their hind</p>\n<p>legs to their big stumps of pickets, and extra ropes</p>",
        "<p>were fitted to the new elephants, and the fodder was</p>\n<p>piled before them, and the hill drivers went back to</p>\n<p>Petersen Sahib through the afternoon light, telling the plains drivers</p>\n<p>to be extra careful that night, and laughing when the</p>\n<p>plains drivers asked the reason. Little Toomai attended to Kala</p>\n<p>Nag’s supper, and as evening fell, wandered through the camp,</p>\n<p>unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom. When an Indian</p>",
        "<p>child’s heart is full, he does not run about and</p>\n<p>make a noise in an irregular fashion. He sits down</p>\n<p>to a sort of revel all by himself. And Little</p>\n<p>Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he</p>\n<p>had not found what he wanted, I believe he would</p>\n<p>have been ill. But the sweetmeat seller in the camp</p>\n<p>lent him a little tom-tom--a drum beaten with the flat</p>",
        "<p>of the hand--and he sat down, cross-legged, before Kala Nag</p>\n<p>as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in</p>\n<p>his lap, and he thumped and he thumped and he</p>\n<p>thumped, and the more he thought of the great honor</p>\n<p>that had been done to him, the more he thumped,</p>\n<p>all alone among the elephant fodder. There was no tune</p>\n<p>and no words, but the thumping made him happy. The</p>",
        "<p>new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted</p>\n<p>from time to time, and he could hear his mother</p>\n<p>in the camp hut putting his small brother to sleep</p>\n<p>with an old, old song about the great God Shiv,</p>\n<p>who once told all the animals what they should eat.</p>\n<p>It is a very soothing lullaby, and the first verse</p>\n<p>says: Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds</p>",
        "<p>to blow, Sitting at the doorways of a day of</p>\n<p>long ago, Gave to each his portion, food and toil</p>\n<p>and fate, From the King upon the _guddee_ to the</p>\n<p>Beggar at the gate. All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.</p>\n<p>Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He made all-- Thorn for the camel, fodder</p>\n<p>for the kine, And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O</p>\n<p>little son of mine! Little Toomai came in with a</p>",
        "<p>joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each verse, till he</p>\n<p>felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala</p>\n<p>Nag’s side. At last the elephants began to lie down</p>\n<p>one after another as is their custom, till only Kala</p>\n<p>Nag at the right of the line was left standing</p>\n<p>up; and he rocked slowly from side to side, his</p>\n<p>ears put forward to listen to the night wind as</p>",
        "<p>it blew very slowly across the hills. The air was</p>\n<p>full of all the night noises that, taken together, make</p>\n<p>one big silence--the click of one bamboo stem against the</p>\n<p>other, the rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the</p>\n<p>scratch and squawk of a half-waked bird (birds are awake</p>\n<p>in the night much more often than we imagine), and</p>\n<p>the fall of water ever so far away. Little Toomai</p>",
        "<p>slept for some time, and when he waked it was</p>\n<p>brilliant moonlight, and Kala Nag was still standing up with</p>\n<p>his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned, rustling in the fodder,</p>\n<p>and watched the curve of his big back against half</p>\n<p>the stars in heaven, and while he watched he heard,</p>\n<p>so far away that it sounded no more than a</p>\n<p>pinhole of noise pricked through the stillness, the “hoot-toot” of</p>",
        "<p>a wild elephant. All the elephants in the lines jumped</p>\n<p>up as if they had been shot, and their grunts</p>\n<p>at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out</p>\n<p>and drove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and</p>\n<p>tightened this rope and knotted that till all was quiet.</p>\n<p>One new elephant had nearly grubbed up his picket, and</p>\n<p>Big Toomai took off Kala Nag’s leg chain and shackled</p>",
        "<p>that elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of</p>\n<p>grass string round Kala Nag’s leg, and told him to</p>\n<p>remember that he was tied fast. He knew that he</p>\n<p>and his father and his grandfather had done the very</p>\n<p>same thing hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did not</p>\n<p>answer to the order by gurgling, as he usually did.</p>\n<p>He stood still, looking out across the moonlight, his head</p>",
        "<p>a little raised and his ears spread like fans, up</p>\n<p>to the great folds of the Garo hills. “Tend to</p>\n<p>him if he grows restless in the night,” said Big</p>\n<p>Toomai to Little Toomai, and he went into the hut</p>\n<p>and slept. Little Toomai was just going to sleep, too,</p>\n<p>when he heard the coir string snap with a little</p>\n<p>“tang,” and Kala Nag rolled out of his pickets as</p>",
        "<p>slowly and as silently as a cloud rolls out of</p>\n<p>the mouth of a valley. Little Toomai pattered after him,</p>\n<p>barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling under his</p>\n<p>breath, “Kala Nag! Kala Nag! Take me with you, O</p>\n<p>Kala Nag!” The elephant turned, without a sound, took three</p>\n<p>strides back to the boy in the moonlight, put down</p>\n<p>his trunk, swung him up to his neck, and almost</p>",
        "<p>before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the</p>\n<p>forest. There was one blast of furious trumpeting from the</p>\n<p>lines, and then the silence shut down on everything, and</p>\n<p>Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes a tuft of high</p>\n<p>grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along</p>\n<p>the sides of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of</p>\n<p>wild-pepper vines would scrape along his back, or a bamboo</p>",
        "<p>would creak where his shoulder touched it. But between those</p>\n<p>times he moved absolutely without any sound, drifting through the</p>\n<p>thick Garo forest as though it had been smoke. He</p>\n<p>was going uphill, but though Little Toomai watched the stars</p>\n<p>in the rifts of the trees, he could not tell</p>\n<p>in what direction. Then Kala Nag reached the crest of</p>\n<p>the ascent and stopped for a minute, and Little Toomai</p>",
        "<p>could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled</p>\n<p>and furry under the moonlight for miles and miles, and</p>\n<p>the blue-white mist over the river in the hollow. Toomai</p>\n<p>leaned forward and looked, and he felt that the forest</p>\n<p>was awake below him--awake and alive and crowded. A big</p>\n<p>brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear; a porcupine’s quills</p>\n<p>rattled in the thicket; and in the darkness between the</p>",
        "<p>tree stems he heard a hog-bear digging hard in the</p>\n<p>moist warm earth, and snuffing as it digged. Then the</p>\n<p>branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began</p>\n<p>to go down into the valley--not quietly this time, but</p>\n<p>as a runaway gun goes down a steep bank--in one</p>\n<p>rush. The huge limbs moved as steadily as pistons, eight</p>\n<p>feet to each stride, and the wrinkled skin of the</p>",
        "<p>elbow points rustled. The undergrowth on either side of him</p>\n<p>ripped with a noise like torn canvas, and the saplings</p>\n<p>that he heaved away right and left with his shoulders</p>\n<p>sprang back again and banged him on the flank, and</p>\n<p>great trails of creepers, all matted together, hung from his</p>\n<p>tusks as he threw his head from side to side</p>\n<p>and plowed out his pathway. Then Little Toomai laid himself</p>",
        "<p>down close to the great neck lest a swinging bough</p>\n<p>should sweep him to the ground, and he wished that</p>\n<p>he were back in the lines again. The grass began</p>\n<p>to get squashy, and Kala Nag’s feet sucked and squelched</p>\n<p>as he put them down, and the night mist at</p>\n<p>the bottom of the valley chilled Little Toomai. There was</p>\n<p>a splash and a trample, and the rush of running</p>",
        "<p>water, and Kala Nag strode through the bed of a</p>\n<p>river, feeling his way at each step. Above the noise</p>\n<p>of the water, as it swirled round the elephant’s legs,</p>\n<p>Little Toomai could hear more splashing and some trumpeting both</p>\n<p>upstream and down--great grunts and angry snortings, and all the</p>\n<p>mist about him seemed to be full of rolling, wavy</p>\n<p>shadows. “Ai!” he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. “The</p>",
        "<p>elephant-folk are out tonight. It is the dance, then!” Kala</p>\n<p>Nag swashed out of the water, blew his trunk clear,</p>\n<p>and began another climb. But this time he was not</p>\n<p>alone, and he had not to make his path. That</p>\n<p>was made already, six feet wide, in front of him,</p>\n<p>where the bent jungle-grass was trying to recover itself and</p>\n<p>stand up. Many elephants must have gone that way only</p>",
        "<p>a few minutes before. Little Toomai looked back, and behind</p>\n<p>him a great wild tusker with his little pig’s eyes</p>\n<p>glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of</p>\n<p>the misty river. Then the trees closed up again, and</p>\n<p>they went on and up, with trumpetings and crashings, and</p>\n<p>the sound of breaking branches on every side of them.</p>\n<p>At last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at</p>",
        "<p>the very top of the hill. They were part of</p>\n<p>a circle of trees that grew round an irregular space</p>\n<p>of some three or four acres, and in all that</p>\n<p>space, as Little Toomai could see, the ground had been</p>\n<p>trampled down as hard as a brick floor. Some trees</p>\n<p>grew in the center of the clearing, but their bark</p>\n<p>was rubbed away, and the white wood beneath showed all</p>",
        "<p>shiny and polished in the patches of moonlight. There were</p>\n<p>creepers hanging from the upper branches, and the bells of</p>\n<p>the flowers of the creepers, great waxy white things like</p>\n<p>convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. But within the limits of</p>\n<p>the clearing there was not a single blade of green--nothing</p>\n<p>but the trampled earth. The moonlight showed it all iron</p>\n<p>gray, except where some elephants stood upon it, and their</p>",
        "<p>shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked, holding his breath,</p>\n<p>with his eyes starting out of his head, and as</p>\n<p>he looked, more and more and more elephants swung out</p>\n<p>into the open from between the tree trunks. Little Toomai</p>\n<p>could only count up to ten, and he counted again</p>\n<p>and again on his fingers till he lost count of</p>\n<p>the tens, and his head began to swim. Outside the</p>",
        "<p>clearing he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth as</p>\n<p>they worked their way up the hillside, but as soon</p>\n<p>as they were within the circle of the tree trunks</p>\n<p>they moved like ghosts. There were white-tusked wild males, with</p>\n<p>fallen leaves and nuts and twigs lying in the wrinkles</p>\n<p>of their necks and the folds of their ears; fat,</p>\n<p>slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black calves only three</p>",
        "<p>or four feet high running under their stomachs; young elephants</p>\n<p>with their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud</p>\n<p>of them; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious</p>\n<p>faces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants,</p>\n<p>scarred from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts</p>\n<p>of bygone fights, and the caked dirt of their solitary</p>\n<p>mud baths dropping from their shoulders; and there was one</p>",
        "<p>with a broken tusk and the marks of the full-stroke,</p>\n<p>the terrible drawing scrape, of a tiger’s claws on his</p>\n<p>side. They were standing head to head, or walking to</p>\n<p>and fro across the ground in couples, or rocking and</p>\n<p>swaying all by themselves--scores and scores of elephants. Toomai knew</p>\n<p>that so long as he lay still on Kala Nag’s</p>\n<p>neck nothing would happen to him, for even in the</p>",
        "<p>rush and scramble of a Keddah drive a wild elephant</p>\n<p>does not reach up with his trunk and drag a</p>\n<p>man off the neck of a tame elephant. And these</p>\n<p>elephants were not thinking of men that night. Once they</p>\n<p>started and put their ears forward when they heard the</p>\n<p>chinking of a leg iron in the forest, but it</p>\n<p>was Pudmini, Petersen Sahib’s pet elephant, her chain snapped short</p>",
        "<p>off, grunting, snuffling up the hillside. She must have broken</p>\n<p>her pickets and come straight from Petersen Sahib’s camp; and</p>\n<p>Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that he did not</p>\n<p>know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast.</p>\n<p>He, too, must have run away from some camp in</p>\n<p>the hills about. At last there was no sound of</p>\n<p>any more elephants moving in the forest, and Kala Nag</p>",
        "<p>rolled out from his station between the trees and went</p>\n<p>into the middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and</p>\n<p>all the elephants began to talk in their own tongue,</p>\n<p>and to move about. Still lying down, Little Toomai looked</p>\n<p>down upon scores and scores of broad backs, and wagging</p>\n<p>ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling eyes. He heard</p>\n<p>the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by</p>",
        "<p>accident, and the dry rustle of trunks twined together, and</p>\n<p>the chafing of enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd,</p>\n<p>and the incessant flick and hissh of the great tails.</p>\n<p>Then a cloud came over the moon, and he sat</p>\n<p>in black darkness. But the quiet, steady hustling and pushing</p>\n<p>and gurgling went on just the same. He knew that</p>\n<p>there were elephants all round Kala Nag, and that there</p>",
        "<p>was no chance of backing him out of the assembly;</p>\n<p>so he set his teeth and shivered. In a Keddah</p>\n<p>at least there was torchlight and shouting, but here he</p>\n<p>was all alone in the dark, and once a trunk</p>\n<p>came up and touched him on the knee. Then an</p>\n<p>elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five</p>\n<p>or ten terrible seconds. The dew from the trees above</p>",
        "<p>spattered down like rain on the unseen backs, and a</p>\n<p>dull booming noise began, not very loud at first, and</p>\n<p>Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it</p>\n<p>grew and grew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot</p>\n<p>and then the other, and brought them down on the</p>\n<p>ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as trip-hammers. The elephants were stamping</p>\n<p>all together now, and it sounded like a war drum</p>",
        "<p>beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell</p>\n<p>from the trees till there was no more left to</p>\n<p>fall, and the booming went on, and the ground rocked</p>\n<p>and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up to</p>\n<p>his ears to shut out the sound. But it was</p>\n<p>all one gigantic jar that ran through him--this stamp of</p>\n<p>hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth. Once or</p>",
        "<p>twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others</p>\n<p>surge forward a few strides, and the thumping would change</p>\n<p>to the crushing sound of juicy green things being bruised,</p>\n<p>but in a minute or two the boom of feet</p>\n<p>on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and</p>\n<p>groaning somewhere near him. He put out his arm and</p>\n<p>felt the bark, but Kala Nag moved forward, still tramping,</p>",
        "<p>and he could not tell where he was in the</p>\n<p>clearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once,</p>\n<p>when two or three little calves squeaked together. Then he</p>\n<p>heard a thump and a shuffle, and the booming went</p>\n<p>on. It must have lasted fully two hours, and Little</p>\n<p>Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the</p>\n<p>smell of the night air that the dawn was coming.</p>",
        "<p>The morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind</p>\n<p>the green hills, and the booming stopped with the first</p>\n<p>ray, as though the light had been an order. Before</p>\n<p>Little Toomai had got the ringing out of his head,</p>\n<p>before even he had shifted his position, there was not</p>\n<p>an elephant in sight except Kala Nag, Pudmini, and the</p>\n<p>elephant with the rope-galls, and there was neither sign nor</p>",
        "<p>rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to show where the</p>\n<p>others had gone. Little Toomai stared again and again. The</p>\n<p>clearing, as he remembered it, had grown in the night.</p>\n<p>More trees stood in the middle of it, but the</p>\n<p>undergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been</p>\n<p>rolled back. Little Toomai stared once more. Now he understood</p>\n<p>the trampling. The elephants had stamped out more room--had stamped</p>",
        "<p>the thick grass and juicy cane to trash, the trash</p>\n<p>into slivers, the slivers into tiny fibers, and the fibers</p>\n<p>into hard earth. “Wah!” said Little Toomai, and his eyes</p>\n<p>were very heavy. “Kala Nag, my lord, let us keep</p>\n<p>by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib’s camp, or I</p>\n<p>shall drop from thy neck.” The third elephant watched the</p>\n<p>two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and took his own</p>",
        "<p>path. He may have belonged to some little native king’s</p>\n<p>establishment, fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away. Two</p>\n<p>hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his</p>\n<p>elephants, who had been double chained that night, began to</p>\n<p>trumpet, and Pudmini, mired to the shoulders, with Kala Nag,</p>\n<p>very footsore, shambled into the camp. Little Toomai’s face was</p>\n<p>gray and pinched, and his hair was full of leaves</p>",
        "<p>and drenched with dew, but he tried to salute Petersen</p>\n<p>Sahib, and cried faintly: “The dance--the elephant dance! I have</p>\n<p>seen it, and--I die!” As Kala Nag sat down, he</p>\n<p>slid off his neck in a dead faint. But, since</p>\n<p>native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two</p>\n<p>hours he was lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahib’s hammock</p>\n<p>with Petersen Sahib’s shooting-coat under his head, and a glass</p>",
        "<p>of warm milk, a little brandy, with a dash of</p>\n<p>quinine, inside of him, and while the old hairy, scarred</p>\n<p>hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him, looking</p>\n<p>at him as though he were a spirit, he told</p>\n<p>his tale in short words, as a child will, and</p>\n<p>wound up with: “Now, if I lie in one word,</p>\n<p>send men to see, and they will find that the</p>",
        "<p>elephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room,</p>\n<p>and they will find ten and ten, and many times</p>\n<p>ten, tracks leading to that dance-room. They made more room</p>\n<p>with their feet. I have seen it. Kala Nag took</p>\n<p>me, and I saw. Also Kala Nag is very leg-weary!”</p>\n<p>Little Toomai lay back and slept all through the long</p>\n<p>afternoon and into the twilight, and while he slept Petersen</p>",
        "<p>Sahib and Machua Appa followed the track of the two</p>\n<p>elephants for fifteen miles across the hills. Petersen Sahib had</p>\n<p>spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he had only</p>\n<p>once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa had no</p>\n<p>need to look twice at the clearing to see what</p>\n<p>had been done there, or to scratch with his toe</p>\n<p>in the packed, rammed earth. “The child speaks truth,” said</p>",
        "<p>he. “All this was done last night, and I have</p>\n<p>counted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where Pudmini’s</p>\n<p>leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was</p>\n<p>there too.” They looked at one another and up and</p>\n<p>down, and they wondered. For the ways of elephants are</p>\n<p>beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to</p>\n<p>fathom. “Forty years and five,” said Machua Appa, “have I</p>",
        "<p>followed my lord, the elephant, but never have I heard</p>\n<p>that any child of man had seen what this child</p>\n<p>has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it</p>\n<p>is--what can we say?” and he shook his head. When</p>\n<p>they got back to camp it was time for the</p>\n<p>evening meal. Petersen Sahib ate alone in his tent, but</p>\n<p>he gave orders that the camp should have two sheep</p>",
        "<p>and some fowls, as well as a double ration of</p>\n<p>flour and rice and salt, for he knew that there</p>\n<p>would be a feast. Big Toomai had come up hotfoot</p>\n<p>from the camp in the plains to search for his</p>\n<p>son and his elephant, and now that he had found</p>\n<p>them he looked at them as though he were afraid</p>\n<p>of them both. And there was a feast by the</p>",
        "<p>blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants,</p>\n<p>and Little Toomai was the hero of it all. And</p>\n<p>the big brown elephant catchers, the trackers and drivers and</p>\n<p>ropers, and the men who know all the secrets of</p>\n<p>breaking the wildest elephants, passed him from one to the</p>\n<p>other, and they marked his forehead with blood from the</p>\n<p>breast of a newly killed jungle-cock, to show that he</p>",
        "<p>was a forester, initiated and free of all the jungles.</p>\n<p>And at last, when the flames died down, and the</p>\n<p>red light of the logs made the elephants look as</p>\n<p>though they had been dipped in blood too, Machua Appa,</p>\n<p>the head of all the drivers of all the Keddahs--Machua</p>\n<p>Appa, Petersen Sahib’s other self, who had never seen a</p>\n<p>made road in forty years: Machua Appa, who was so</p>",
        "<p>great that he had no other name than Machua Appa,--leaped</p>\n<p>to his feet, with Little Toomai held high in the</p>\n<p>air above his head, and shouted: “Listen, my brothers. Listen,</p>\n<p>too, you my lords in the lines there, for I,</p>\n<p>Machua Appa, am speaking! This little one shall no more</p>\n<p>be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of the Elephants, as</p>\n<p>his great-grandfather was called before him. What never man has</p>",
        "<p>seen he has seen through the long night, and the</p>\n<p>favor of the elephant-folk and of the Gods of the</p>\n<p>Jungles is with him. He shall become a great tracker.</p>\n<p>He shall become greater than I, even I, Machua Appa!</p>\n<p>He shall follow the new trail, and the stale trail,</p>\n<p>and the mixed trail, with a clear eye! He shall</p>\n<p>take no harm in the Keddah when he runs under</p>",
        "<p>their bellies to rope the wild tuskers; and if he</p>\n<p>slips before the feet of the charging bull elephant, the</p>\n<p>bull elephant shall know who he is and shall not</p>\n<p>crush him. Aihai! my lords in the chains,”--he whirled up</p>\n<p>the line of pickets--“here is the little one that has</p>\n<p>seen your dances in your hidden places,--the sight that never</p>\n<p>man saw! Give him honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my</p>",
        "<p>children. Make your salute to Toomai of the Elephants! Gunga</p>\n<p>Pershad, ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi Guj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa! Pudmini,--thou</p>\n<p>hast seen him at the dance, and thou too, Kala</p>\n<p>Nag, my pearl among elephants!--ahaa! Together! To Toomai of the</p>\n<p>Elephants. Barrao!” And at that last wild yell the whole</p>\n<p>line flung up their trunks till the tips touched their</p>\n<p>foreheads, and broke out into the full salute--the crashing trumpet-peal</p>",
        "<p>that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut of</p>\n<p>the Keddah. But it was all for the sake of</p>\n<p>Little Toomai, who had seen what never man had seen</p>\n<p>before--the dance of the elephants at night and alone in</p>\n<p>the heart of the Garo hills! Shiv and the Grasshopper</p>\n<p>(The song that Toomai’s mother sang to the baby) Shiv,</p>\n<p>who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,</p>",
        "<p>Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,</p>\n<p>Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,</p>\n<p>From the King upon the _guddee_ to the Beggar at</p>\n<p>the gate. _All things made he--Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo! Mahadeo!</p>\n<p>He made all,-- Thorn for the camel, fodder for the</p>\n<p>kine, And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son</p>\n<p>of mine!_ Wheat he gave to rich folk, millet to</p>",
        "<p>the poor, Broken scraps for holy men that beg from</p>\n<p>door to door; Battle to the tiger, carrion to the</p>\n<p>kite, And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the</p>\n<p>wall at night. Naught he found too lofty, none he</p>\n<p>saw too low-- Parbati beside him watched them come and</p>\n<p>go; Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest--</p>\n<p>Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.</p>",
        "<p>_So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo! Mahadeo! Turn</p>\n<p>and see. Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine,</p>\n<p>But this was Least of Little Things, O little son</p>\n<p>of mine!_ When the dole was ended, laughingly she said,</p>\n<p>“Master, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?” Laughing,</p>\n<p>Shiv made answer, “All have had their part, Even he,</p>\n<p>the little one, hidden ’neath thy heart.” From her breast</p>",
        "<p>she plucked it, Parbati the thief, Saw the Least of</p>\n<p>Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf! Saw and feared and</p>\n<p>wondered, making prayer to Shiv, Who hath surely given meat</p>\n<p>to all that live. _All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.</p>\n<p>Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He made all,-- Thorn for the camel, fodder</p>\n<p>for the kine, And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O</p>\n<p>little son of mine!_</p>",
        "<h3>Her Majesty’s Servants</h3>\n<p>You can work it out by Fractions or by simple</p>\n<p>Rule of Three, But the way of Tweedle-dum is not</p>\n<p>the way of Tweedle-dee. You can twist it, you can</p>\n<p>turn it, you can plait it till you drop, But</p>\n<p>the way of Pilly Winky’s not the way of Winkie</p>\n<p>Pop! It had been raining heavily for one whole month--raining</p>\n<p>on a camp of thirty thousand men and thousands of</p>",
        "<p>camels, elephants, horses, bullocks, and mules all gathered together at</p>\n<p>a place called Rawal Pindi, to be reviewed by the</p>\n<p>Viceroy of India. He was receiving a visit from the</p>\n<p>Amir of Afghanistan--a wild king of a very wild country.</p>\n<p>The Amir had brought with him for a bodyguard eight</p>\n<p>hundred men and horses who had never seen a camp</p>\n<p>or a locomotive before in their lives--savage men and savage</p>",
        "<p>horses from somewhere at the back of Central Asia. Every</p>\n<p>night a mob of these horses would be sure to</p>\n<p>break their heel ropes and stampede up and down the</p>\n<p>camp through the mud in the dark, or the camels</p>\n<p>would break loose and run about and fall over the</p>\n<p>ropes of the tents, and you can imagine how pleasant</p>\n<p>that was for men trying to go to sleep. My</p>",
        "<p>tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I</p>\n<p>thought it was safe. But one night a man popped</p>\n<p>his head in and shouted, “Get out, quick! They’re coming!</p>\n<p>My tent’s gone!” I knew who “they” were, so I</p>\n<p>put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled out into</p>\n<p>the slush. Little Vixen, my fox terrier, went out through</p>\n<p>the other side; and then there was a roaring and</p>",
        "<p>a grunting and bubbling, and I saw the tent cave</p>\n<p>in, as the pole snapped, and begin to dance about</p>\n<p>like a mad ghost. A camel had blundered into it,</p>\n<p>and wet and angry as I was, I could not</p>\n<p>help laughing. Then I ran on, because I did not</p>\n<p>know how many camels might have got loose, and before</p>\n<p>long I was out of sight of the camp, plowing</p>",
        "<p>my way through the mud. At last I fell over</p>\n<p>the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I</p>\n<p>was somewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were</p>\n<p>stacked at night. As I did not want to plowter</p>\n<p>about any more in the drizzle and the dark, I</p>\n<p>put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun, and</p>\n<p>made a sort of wigwam with two or three rammers</p>",
        "<p>that I found, and lay along the tail of another</p>\n<p>gun, wondering where Vixen had got to, and where I</p>\n<p>might be. Just as I was getting ready to go</p>\n<p>to sleep I heard a jingle of harness and a</p>\n<p>grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears.</p>\n<p>He belonged to a screw-gun battery, for I could hear</p>\n<p>the rattle of the straps and rings and chains and</p>",
        "<p>things on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little</p>\n<p>cannon made in two pieces, that are screwed together when</p>\n<p>the time comes to use them. They are taken up</p>\n<p>mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and</p>\n<p>they are very useful for fighting in rocky country. Behind</p>\n<p>the mule there was a camel, with his big soft</p>\n<p>feet squelching and slipping in the mud, and his neck</p>",
        "<p>bobbing to and fro like a strayed hen’s. Luckily, I</p>\n<p>knew enough of beast language--not wild-beast language, but camp-beast language,</p>\n<p>of course--from the natives to know what he was saying.</p>\n<p>He must have been the one that flopped into my</p>\n<p>tent, for he called to the mule, “What shall I</p>\n<p>do? Where shall I go? I have fought with a</p>\n<p>white thing that waved, and it took a stick and</p>",
        "<p>hit me on the neck.” (That was my broken tent</p>\n<p>pole, and I was very glad to know it.) “Shall</p>\n<p>we run on?” “Oh, it was you,” said the mule,</p>\n<p>“you and your friends, that have been disturbing the camp?</p>\n<p>All right. You’ll be beaten for this in the morning.</p>\n<p>But I may as well give you something on account</p>\n<p>now.” I heard the harness jingle as the mule backed</p>",
        "<p>and caught the camel two kicks in the ribs that</p>\n<p>rang like a drum. “Another time,” he said, “you’ll know</p>\n<p>better than to run through a mule battery at night,</p>\n<p>shouting `Thieves and fire!’ Sit down, and keep your silly</p>\n<p>neck quiet.” The camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot</p>\n<p>rule, and sat down whimpering. There was a regular beat</p>\n<p>of hoofs in the darkness, and a big troop-horse cantered</p>",
        "<p>up as steadily as though he were on parade, jumped</p>\n<p>a gun tail, and landed close to the mule. “It’s</p>\n<p>disgraceful,” he said, blowing out his nostrils. “Those camels have</p>\n<p>racketed through our lines again--the third time this week. How’s</p>\n<p>a horse to keep his condition if he isn’t allowed</p>\n<p>to sleep. Who’s here?” “I’m the breech-piece mule of number</p>\n<p>two gun of the First Screw Battery,” said the mule,</p>",
        "<p>“and the other’s one of your friends. He’s waked me</p>\n<p>up too. Who are you?” “Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth</p>\n<p>Lancers--Dick Cunliffe’s horse. Stand over a little, there.” “Oh, beg</p>\n<p>your pardon,” said the mule. “It’s too dark to see</p>\n<p>much. Aren’t these camels too sickening for anything? I walked</p>\n<p>out of my lines to get a little peace and</p>\n<p>quiet here.” “My lords,” said the camel humbly, “we dreamed</p>",
        "<p>bad dreams in the night, and we were very much</p>\n<p>afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th</p>\n<p>Native Infantry, and I am not as brave as you</p>\n<p>are, my lords.” “Then why didn’t you stay and carry</p>\n<p>baggage for the 39th Native Infantry, instead of running all</p>\n<p>round the camp?” said the mule. “They were such very</p>\n<p>bad dreams,” said the camel. “I am sorry. Listen! What</p>",
        "<p>is that? Shall we run on again?” “Sit down,” said</p>\n<p>the mule, “or you’ll snap your long stick-legs between the</p>\n<p>guns.” He cocked one ear and listened. “Bullocks!” he said.</p>\n<p>“Gun bullocks. On my word, you and your friends have</p>\n<p>waked the camp very thoroughly. It takes a good deal</p>\n<p>of prodding to put up a gun-bullock.” I heard a</p>\n<p>chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the</p>",
        "<p>great sulky white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns</p>\n<p>when the elephants won’t go any nearer to the firing,</p>\n<p>came shouldering along together. And almost stepping on the chain</p>\n<p>was another battery mule, calling wildly for “Billy.” “That’s one</p>\n<p>of our recruits,” said the old mule to the troop</p>\n<p>horse. “He’s calling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The</p>\n<p>dark never hurt anybody yet.” The gun-bullocks lay down together</p>",
        "<p>and began chewing the cud, but the young mule huddled</p>\n<p>close to Billy. “Things!” he said. “Fearful and horrible, Billy!</p>\n<p>They came into our lines while we were asleep. D’you</p>\n<p>think they’ll kill us?” “I’ve a very great mind to</p>\n<p>give you a number-one kicking,” said Billy. “The idea of</p>\n<p>a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the battery before</p>\n<p>this gentleman!” “Gently, gently!” said the troop-horse. “Remember they are</p>",
        "<p>always like this to begin with. The first time I</p>\n<p>ever saw a man (it was in Australia when I</p>\n<p>was a three-year-old) I ran for half a day, and</p>\n<p>if I’d seen a camel, I should have been running</p>\n<p>still.” Nearly all our horses for the English cavalry are</p>\n<p>brought to India from Australia, and are broken in by</p>\n<p>the troopers themselves. “True enough,” said Billy. “Stop shaking, youngster.</p>",
        "<p>The first time they put the full harness with all</p>\n<p>its chains on my back I stood on my forelegs</p>\n<p>and kicked every bit of it off. I hadn’t learned</p>\n<p>the real science of kicking then, but the battery said</p>\n<p>they had never seen anything like it.” “But this wasn’t</p>\n<p>harness or anything that jingled,” said the young mule. “You</p>\n<p>know I don’t mind that now, Billy. It was Things</p>",
        "<p>like trees, and they fell up and down the lines</p>\n<p>and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and I couldn’t find</p>\n<p>my driver, and I couldn’t find you, Billy, so I</p>\n<p>ran off with--with these gentlemen.” “H’m!” said Billy. “As soon</p>\n<p>as I heard the camels were loose I came away</p>\n<p>on my own account. When a battery--a screw-gun mule calls</p>\n<p>gun-bullocks gentlemen, he must be very badly shaken up. Who</p>",
        "<p>are you fellows on the ground there?” The gun bullocks</p>\n<p>rolled their cuds, and answered both together: “The seventh yoke</p>\n<p>of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery. We</p>\n<p>were asleep when the camels came, but when we were</p>\n<p>trampled on we got up and walked away. It is</p>\n<p>better to lie quiet in the mud than to be</p>\n<p>disturbed on good bedding. We told your friend here that</p>",
        "<p>there was nothing to be afraid of, but he knew</p>\n<p>so much that he thought otherwise. Wah!” They went on</p>\n<p>chewing. “That comes of being afraid,” said Billy. “You get</p>\n<p>laughed at by gun-bullocks. I hope you like it, young</p>\n<p>un.” The young mule’s teeth snapped, and I heard him</p>\n<p>say something about not being afraid of any beefy old</p>\n<p>bullock in the world. But the bullocks only clicked their</p>",
        "<p>horns together and went on chewing. “Now, don’t be angry</p>\n<p>after you’ve been afraid. That’s the worst kind of cowardice,”</p>\n<p>said the troop-horse. “Anybody can be forgiven for being scared</p>\n<p>in the night, I think, if they see things they</p>\n<p>don’t understand. We’ve broken out of our pickets, again and</p>\n<p>again, four hundred and fifty of us, just because a</p>\n<p>new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at</p>",
        "<p>home in Australia till we were scared to death of</p>\n<p>the loose ends of our head-ropes.” “That’s all very well</p>\n<p>in camp,” said Billy. “I’m not above stampeding myself, for</p>\n<p>the fun of the thing, when I haven’t been out</p>\n<p>for a day or two. But what do you do</p>\n<p>on active service?” “Oh, that’s quite another set of new</p>\n<p>shoes,” said the troop horse. “Dick Cunliffe’s on my back</p>",
        "<p>then, and drives his knees into me, and all I</p>\n<p>have to do is to watch where I am putting</p>\n<p>my feet, and to keep my hind legs well under</p>\n<p>me, and be bridle-wise.” “What’s bridle-wise?” said the young mule.</p>\n<p>“By the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks,” snorted the</p>\n<p>troop-horse, “do you mean to say that you aren’t taught</p>\n<p>to be bridle-wise in your business? How can you do</p>",
        "<p>anything, unless you can spin round at once when the</p>\n<p>rein is pressed on your neck? It means life or</p>\n<p>death to your man, and of course that’s life and</p>\n<p>death to you. Get round with your hind legs under</p>\n<p>you the instant you feel the rein on your neck.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t room to swing round, rear up a</p>\n<p>little and come round on your hind legs. That’s being</p>",
        "<p>bridle-wise.” “We aren’t taught that way,” said Billy the mule</p>\n<p>stiffly. “We’re taught to obey the man at our head:</p>\n<p>step off when he says so, and step in when</p>\n<p>he says so. I suppose it comes to the same</p>\n<p>thing. Now, with all this fine fancy business and rearing,</p>\n<p>which must be very bad for your hocks, what do</p>\n<p>you do?” “That depends,” said the troop-horse. “Generally I have</p>",
        "<p>to go in among a lot of yelling, hairy men</p>\n<p>with knives--long shiny knives, worse than the farrier’s knives--and I</p>\n<p>have to take care that Dick’s boot is just touching</p>\n<p>the next man’s boot without crushing it. I can see</p>\n<p>Dick’s lance to the right of my right eye, and</p>\n<p>I know I’m safe. I shouldn’t care to be the</p>\n<p>man or horse that stood up to Dick and me</p>",
        "<p>when we’re in a hurry.” “Don’t the knives hurt?” said</p>\n<p>the young mule. “Well, I got one cut across the</p>\n<p>chest once, but that wasn’t Dick’s fault--” “A lot I</p>\n<p>should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!”</p>\n<p>said the young mule. “You must,” said the troop horse.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t trust your man, you may as well</p>\n<p>run away at once. That’s what some of our horses</p>",
        "<p>do, and I don’t blame them. As I was saying,</p>\n<p>it wasn’t Dick’s fault. The man was lying on the</p>\n<p>ground, and I stretched myself not to tread on him,</p>\n<p>and he slashed up at me. Next time I have</p>\n<p>to go over a man lying down I shall step</p>\n<p>on him--hard.” “H’m!” said Billy. “It sounds very foolish. Knives</p>\n<p>are dirty things at any time. The proper thing to</p>",
        "<p>do is to climb up a mountain with a well-balanced</p>\n<p>saddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears</p>\n<p>too, and creep and crawl and wriggle along, till you</p>\n<p>come out hundreds of feet above anyone else on a</p>\n<p>ledge where there’s just room enough for your hoofs. Then</p>\n<p>you stand still and keep quiet--never ask a man to</p>\n<p>hold your head, young un--keep quiet while the guns are</p>",
        "<p>being put together, and then you watch the little poppy</p>\n<p>shells drop down into the tree-tops ever so far below.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you ever trip?” said the troop-horse. “They say that</p>\n<p>when a mule trips you can split a hen’s ear,”</p>\n<p>said Billy. “Now and again perhaps a badly packed saddle</p>\n<p>will upset a mule, but it’s very seldom. I wish</p>\n<p>I could show you our business. It’s beautiful. Why, it</p>",
        "<p>took me three years to find out what the men</p>\n<p>were driving at. The science of the thing is never</p>\n<p>to show up against the sky line, because, if you</p>\n<p>do, you may get fired at. Remember that, young un.</p>\n<p>Always keep hidden as much as possible, even if you</p>\n<p>have to go a mile out of your way. I</p>\n<p>lead the battery when it comes to that sort of</p>",
        "<p>climbing.” “Fired at without the chance of running into the</p>\n<p>people who are firing!” said the troop-horse, thinking hard. “I</p>\n<p>couldn’t stand that. I should want to charge--with Dick.” “Oh,</p>\n<p>no, you wouldn’t. You know that as soon as the</p>\n<p>guns are in position they’ll do all the charging. That’s</p>\n<p>scientific and neat. But knives--pah!” The baggage-camel had been bobbing</p>\n<p>his head to and fro for some time past, anxious</p>",
        "<p>to get a word in edgewise. Then I heard him</p>\n<p>say, as he cleared his throat, nervously: “I--I--I have fought</p>\n<p>a little, but not in that climbing way or that</p>\n<p>running way.” “No. Now you mention it,” said Billy, “you</p>\n<p>don’t look as though you were made for climbing or</p>\n<p>running--much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?” “The proper way,”</p>\n<p>said the camel. “We all sat down--” “Oh, my crupper</p>",
        "<p>and breastplate!” said the troop-horse under his breath. “Sat down!”</p>\n<p>“We sat down--a hundred of us,” the camel went on,</p>\n<p>“in a big square, and the men piled our packs</p>\n<p>and saddles, outside the square, and they fired over our</p>\n<p>backs, the men did, on all sides of the square.”</p>\n<p>“What sort of men? Any men that came along?” said</p>\n<p>the troop-horse. “They teach us in riding school to lie</p>",
        "<p>down and let our masters fire across us, but Dick</p>\n<p>Cunliffe is the only man I’d trust to do that.</p>\n<p>It tickles my girths, and, besides, I can’t see with</p>\n<p>my head on the ground.” “What does it matter who</p>\n<p>fires across you?” said the camel. “There are plenty of</p>\n<p>men and plenty of other camels close by, and a</p>\n<p>great many clouds of smoke. I am not frightened then.</p>",
        "<p>I sit still and wait.” “And yet,” said Billy, “you</p>\n<p>dream bad dreams and upset the camp at night. Well,</p>\n<p>well! Before I’d lie down, not to speak of sitting</p>\n<p>down, and let a man fire across me, my heels</p>\n<p>and his head would have something to say to each</p>\n<p>other. Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?”</p>\n<p>There was a long silence, and then one of the</p>",
        "<p>gun bullocks lifted up his big head and said, “This</p>\n<p>is very foolish indeed. There is only one way of</p>\n<p>fighting.” “Oh, go on,” said Billy. “Please don’t mind me.</p>\n<p>I suppose you fellows fight standing on your tails?” “Only</p>\n<p>one way,” said the two together. (They must have been</p>\n<p>twins.) “This is that way. To put all twenty yoke</p>\n<p>of us to the big gun as soon as Two</p>",
        "<p>Tails trumpets.” (“Two Tails” is camp slang for the elephant.)</p>\n<p>“What does Two Tails trumpet for?” said the young mule.</p>\n<p>“To show that he is not going any nearer to</p>\n<p>the smoke on the other side. Two Tails is a</p>\n<p>great coward. Then we tug the big gun all together--Heya--Hullah!</p>\n<p>Heeyah! Hullah! We do not climb like cats nor run</p>\n<p>like calves. We go across the level plain, twenty yoke</p>",
        "<p>of us, till we are unyoked again, and we graze</p>\n<p>while the big guns talk across the plain to some</p>\n<p>town with mud walls, and pieces of the wall fall</p>\n<p>out, and the dust goes up as though many cattle</p>\n<p>were coming home.” “Oh! And you choose that time for</p>\n<p>grazing?” said the young mule. “That time or any other.</p>\n<p>Eating is always good. We eat till we are yoked</p>",
        "<p>up again and tug the gun back to where Two</p>\n<p>Tails is waiting for it. Sometimes there are big guns</p>\n<p>in the city that speak back, and some of us</p>\n<p>are killed, and then there is all the more grazing</p>\n<p>for those that are left. This is Fate. None the</p>\n<p>less, Two Tails is a great coward. That is the</p>\n<p>proper way to fight. We are brothers from Hapur. Our</p>",
        "<p>father was a sacred bull of Shiva. We have spoken.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ve certainly learned something tonight,” said the troop-horse. “Do</p>\n<p>you gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat</p>\n<p>when you are being fired at with big guns, and</p>\n<p>Two Tails is behind you?” “About as much as we</p>\n<p>feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all</p>\n<p>over us, or run into people with knives. I never</p>",
        "<p>heard such stuff. A mountain ledge, a well-balanced load, a</p>\n<p>driver you can trust to let you pick your own</p>\n<p>way, and I’m your mule. But--the other things--no!” said Billy,</p>\n<p>with a stamp of his foot. “Of course,” said the</p>\n<p>troop horse, “everyone is not made in the same way,</p>\n<p>and I can quite see that your family, on your</p>\n<p>father’s side, would fail to understand a great many things.”</p>",
        "<p>“Never you mind my family on my father’s side,” said</p>\n<p>Billy angrily, for every mule hates to be reminded that</p>\n<p>his father was a donkey. “My father was a Southern</p>\n<p>gentleman, and he could pull down and bite and kick</p>\n<p>into rags every horse he came across. Remember that, you</p>\n<p>big brown Brumby!” Brumby means wild horse without any breeding.</p>\n<p>Imagine the feelings of Sunol if a car-horse called her</p>",
        "<p>a “skate,” and you can imagine how the Australian horse</p>\n<p>felt. I saw the white of his eye glitter in</p>\n<p>the dark. “See here, you son of an imported Malaga</p>\n<p>jackass,” he said between his teeth, “I’d have you know</p>\n<p>that I’m related on my mother’s side to Carbine, winner</p>\n<p>of the Melbourne Cup, and where I come from we</p>\n<p>aren’t accustomed to being ridden over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed,</p>",
        "<p>pig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter battery. Are you ready?”</p>\n<p>“On your hind legs!” squealed Billy. They both reared up</p>\n<p>facing each other, and I was expecting a furious fight,</p>\n<p>when a gurgly, rumbly voice, called out of the darkness</p>\n<p>to the right--“Children, what are you fighting about there? Be</p>\n<p>quiet.” Both beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust,</p>\n<p>for neither horse nor mule can bear to listen to</p>",
        "<p>an elephant’s voice. “It’s Two Tails!” said the troop-horse. “I</p>\n<p>can’t stand him. A tail at each end isn’t fair!”</p>\n<p>“My feelings exactly,” said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for</p>\n<p>company. “We’re very alike in some things.” “I suppose we’ve</p>\n<p>inherited them from our mothers,” said the troop horse. “It’s</p>\n<p>not worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied</p>\n<p>up?” “Yes,” said Two Tails, with a laugh all up</p>",
        "<p>his trunk. “I’m picketed for the night. I’ve heard what</p>\n<p>you fellows have been saying. But don’t be afraid. I’m</p>\n<p>not coming over.” The bullocks and the camel said, half</p>\n<p>aloud, “Afraid of Two Tails--what nonsense!” And the bullocks went</p>\n<p>on, “We are sorry that you heard, but it is</p>\n<p>true. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns</p>\n<p>when they fire?” “Well,” said Two Tails, rubbing one hind</p>",
        "<p>leg against the other, exactly like a little boy saying</p>\n<p>a poem, “I don’t quite know whether you’d understand.” “We</p>\n<p>don’t, but we have to pull the guns,” said the</p>\n<p>bullocks. “I know it, and I know you are a</p>\n<p>good deal braver than you think you are. But it’s</p>\n<p>different with me. My battery captain called me a Pachydermatous</p>\n<p>Anachronism the other day.” “That’s another way of fighting, I</p>",
        "<p>suppose?” said Billy, who was recovering his spirits. “You don’t</p>\n<p>know what that means, of course, but I do. It</p>\n<p>means betwixt and between, and that is just where I</p>\n<p>am. I can see inside my head what will happen</p>\n<p>when a shell bursts, and you bullocks can’t.” “I can,”</p>\n<p>said the troop-horse. “At least a little bit. I try</p>\n<p>not to think about it.” “I can see more than</p>",
        "<p>you, and I do think about it. I know there’s</p>\n<p>a great deal of me to take care of, and</p>\n<p>I know that nobody knows how to cure me when</p>\n<p>I’m sick. All they can do is to stop my</p>\n<p>driver’s pay till I get well, and I can’t trust</p>\n<p>my driver.” “Ah!” said the troop horse. “That explains it.</p>\n<p>I can trust Dick.” “You could put a whole regiment</p>",
        "<p>of Dicks on my back without making me feel any</p>\n<p>better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not</p>\n<p>enough to go on in spite of it.” “We do</p>\n<p>not understand,” said the bullocks. “I know you don’t. I’m</p>\n<p>not talking to you. You don’t know what blood is.”</p>\n<p>“We do,” said the bullocks. “It is red stuff that</p>\n<p>soaks into the ground and smells.” The troop-horse gave a</p>",
        "<p>kick and a bound and a snort. “Don’t talk of</p>\n<p>it,” he said. “I can smell it now, just thinking</p>\n<p>of it. It makes me want to run--when I haven’t</p>\n<p>Dick on my back.” “But it is not here,” said</p>\n<p>the camel and the bullocks. “Why are you so stupid?”</p>\n<p>“It’s vile stuff,” said Billy. “I don’t want to run,</p>\n<p>but I don’t want to talk about it.” “There you</p>",
        "<p>are!” said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain. “Surely.</p>\n<p>Yes, we have been here all night,” said the bullocks.</p>\n<p>Two Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on</p>\n<p>it jingled. “Oh, I’m not talking to you. You can’t</p>\n<p>see inside your heads.” “No. We see out of our</p>\n<p>four eyes,” said the bullocks. “We see straight in front</p>\n<p>of us.” “If I could do that and nothing else,</p>",
        "<p>you wouldn’t be needed to pull the big guns at</p>\n<p>all. If I was like my captain--he can see things</p>\n<p>inside his head before the firing begins, and he shakes</p>\n<p>all over, but he knows too much to run away--if</p>\n<p>I was like him I could pull the guns. But</p>\n<p>if I were as wise as all that I should</p>\n<p>never be here. I should be a king in the</p>",
        "<p>forest, as I used to be, sleeping half the day</p>\n<p>and bathing when I liked. I haven’t had a good</p>\n<p>bath for a month.” “That’s all very fine,” said Billy.</p>\n<p>“But giving a thing a long name doesn’t make it</p>\n<p>any better.” “H’sh!” said the troop horse. “I think I</p>\n<p>understand what Two Tails means.” “You’ll understand better in a</p>\n<p>minute,” said Two Tails angrily. “Now you just explain to</p>",
        "<p>me why you don’t like this!” He began trumpeting furiously</p>\n<p>at the top of his trumpet. “Stop that!” said Billy</p>\n<p>and the troop horse together, and I could hear them</p>\n<p>stamp and shiver. An elephant’s trumpeting is always nasty, especially</p>\n<p>on a dark night. “I shan’t stop,” said Two Tails.</p>\n<p>“Won’t you explain that, please? Hhrrmph! Rrrt! Rrrmph! Rrrhha!” Then</p>\n<p>he stopped suddenly, and I heard a little whimper in</p>",
        "<p>the dark, and knew that Vixen had found me at</p>\n<p>last. She knew as well as I did that if</p>\n<p>there is one thing in the world the elephant is</p>\n<p>more afraid of than another it is a little barking</p>\n<p>dog. So she stopped to bully Two Tails in his</p>\n<p>pickets, and yapped round his big feet. Two Tails shuffled</p>\n<p>and squeaked. “Go away, little dog!” he said. “Don’t snuff</p>",
        "<p>at my ankles, or I’ll kick at you. Good little</p>\n<p>dog--nice little doggie, then! Go home, you yelping little beast!</p>\n<p>Oh, why doesn’t someone take her away? She’ll bite me</p>\n<p>in a minute.” “Seems to me,” said Billy to the</p>\n<p>troop horse, “that our friend Two Tails is afraid of</p>\n<p>most things. Now, if I had a full meal for</p>\n<p>every dog I’ve kicked across the parade-ground I should be</p>",
        "<p>as fat as Two Tails nearly.” I whistled, and Vixen</p>\n<p>ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked my</p>\n<p>nose, and told me a long tale about hunting for</p>\n<p>me all through the camp. I never let her know</p>\n<p>that I understood beast talk, or she would have taken</p>\n<p>all sorts of liberties. So I buttoned her into the</p>\n<p>breast of my overcoat, and Two Tails shuffled and stamped</p>",
        "<p>and growled to himself. “Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!” he said. “It</p>\n<p>runs in our family. Now, where has that nasty little</p>\n<p>beast gone to?” I heard him feeling about with his</p>\n<p>trunk. “We all seem to be affected in various ways,”</p>\n<p>he went on, blowing his nose. “Now, you gentlemen were</p>\n<p>alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted.” “Not alarmed, exactly,” said</p>\n<p>the troop-horse, “but it made me feel as though I</p>",
        "<p>had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don’t begin</p>\n<p>again.” “I’m frightened of a little dog, and the camel</p>\n<p>here is frightened by bad dreams in the night.” “It</p>\n<p>is very lucky for us that we haven’t all got</p>\n<p>to fight in the same way,” said the troop-horse. “What</p>\n<p>I want to know,” said the young mule, who had</p>\n<p>been quiet for a long time--“what I want to know</p>",
        "<p>is, why we have to fight at all.” “Because we’re</p>\n<p>told to,” said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt.</p>\n<p>“Orders,” said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped. “Hukm</p>\n<p>hai!” (It is an order!), said the camel with a</p>\n<p>gurgle, and Two Tails and the bullocks repeated, “Hukm hai!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but who gives the orders?” said the recruit-mule. “The</p>\n<p>man who walks at your head--Or sits on your back--Or</p>",
        "<p>holds the nose rope--Or twists your tail,” said Billy and</p>\n<p>the troop-horse and the camel and the bullocks one after</p>\n<p>the other. “But who gives them the orders?” “Now you</p>\n<p>want to know too much, young un,” said Billy, “and</p>\n<p>that is one way of getting kicked. All you have</p>\n<p>to do is to obey the man at your head</p>\n<p>and ask no questions.” “He’s quite right,” said Two Tails.</p>",
        "<p>“I can’t always obey, because I’m betwixt and between. But</p>\n<p>Billy’s right. Obey the man next to you who gives</p>\n<p>the order, or you’ll stop all the battery, besides getting</p>\n<p>a thrashing.” The gun-bullocks got up to go. “Morning is</p>\n<p>coming,” they said. “We will go back to our lines.</p>\n<p>It is true that we only see out of our</p>\n<p>eyes, and we are not very clever. But still, we</p>",
        "<p>are the only people to-night who have not been afraid.</p>\n<p>Good-night, you brave people.” Nobody answered, and the troop-horse said,</p>\n<p>to change the conversation, “Where’s that little dog? A dog</p>\n<p>means a man somewhere about.” “Here I am,” yapped Vixen,</p>\n<p>“under the gun tail with my man. You big, blundering</p>\n<p>beast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My</p>\n<p>man’s very angry.” “Phew!” said the bullocks. “He must be</p>",
        "<p>white!” “Of course he is,” said Vixen. “Do you suppose</p>\n<p>I’m looked after by a black bullock-driver?” “Huah! Ouach! Ugh!”</p>\n<p>said the bullocks. “Let us get away quickly.” They plunged</p>\n<p>forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their</p>\n<p>yoke on the pole of an ammunition wagon, where it</p>\n<p>jammed. “Now you have done it,” said Billy calmly. “Don’t</p>\n<p>struggle. You’re hung up till daylight. What on earth’s the</p>",
        "<p>matter?” The bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts</p>\n<p>that Indian cattle give, and pushed and crowded and slued</p>\n<p>and stamped and slipped and nearly fell down in the</p>\n<p>mud, grunting savagely. “You’ll break your necks in a minute,”</p>\n<p>said the troop-horse. “What’s the matter with white men? I</p>\n<p>live with ’em.” “They--eat--us! Pull!” said the near bullock. The</p>\n<p>yoke snapped with a twang, and they lumbered off together.</p>",
        "<p>I never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared</p>\n<p>of Englishmen. We eat beef--a thing that no cattle-driver touches--and</p>\n<p>of course the cattle do not like it. “May I</p>\n<p>be flogged with my own pad-chains! Who’d have thought of</p>\n<p>two big lumps like those losing their heads?” said Billy.</p>\n<p>“Never mind. I’m going to look at this man. Most</p>\n<p>of the white men, I know, have things in their</p>",
        "<p>pockets,” said the troop-horse. “I’ll leave you, then. I can’t</p>\n<p>say I’m over-fond of ’em myself. Besides, white men who</p>\n<p>haven’t a place to sleep in are more than likely</p>\n<p>to be thieves, and I’ve a good deal of Government</p>\n<p>property on my back. Come along, young un, and we’ll</p>\n<p>go back to our lines. Good-night, Australia! See you on</p>\n<p>parade to-morrow, I suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!--try to control your</p>",
        "<p>feelings, won’t you? Good-night, Two Tails! If you pass us</p>\n<p>on the ground tomorrow, don’t trumpet. It spoils our formation.”</p>\n<p>Billy the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of</p>\n<p>an old campaigner, as the troop-horse’s head came nuzzling into</p>\n<p>my breast, and I gave him biscuits, while Vixen, who</p>\n<p>is a most conceited little dog, told him fibs about</p>\n<p>the scores of horses that she and I kept. “I’m</p>",
        "<p>coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Where will you be?” “On the left hand of the</p>\n<p>second squadron. I set the time for all my troop,</p>\n<p>little lady,” he said politely. “Now I must go back</p>\n<p>to Dick. My tail’s all muddy, and he’ll have two</p>\n<p>hours’ hard work dressing me for parade.” The big parade</p>\n<p>of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon,</p>",
        "<p>and Vixen and I had a good place close to</p>\n<p>the Viceroy and the Amir of Afghanistan, with high, big</p>\n<p>black hat of astrakhan wool and the great diamond star</p>\n<p>in the center. The first part of the review was</p>\n<p>all sunshine, and the regiments went by in wave upon</p>\n<p>wave of legs all moving together, and guns all in</p>\n<p>a line, till our eyes grew dizzy. Then the cavalry</p>",
        "<p>came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter of “Bonnie Dundee,”</p>\n<p>and Vixen cocked her ear where she sat on the</p>\n<p>dog-cart. The second squadron of the Lancers shot by, and</p>\n<p>there was the troop-horse, with his tail like spun silk,</p>\n<p>his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and</p>\n<p>one back, setting the time for all his squadron, his</p>\n<p>legs going as smoothly as waltz music. Then the big</p>",
        "<p>guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two</p>\n<p>other elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun,</p>\n<p>while twenty yoke of oxen walked behind. The seventh pair</p>\n<p>had a new yoke, and they looked rather stiff and</p>\n<p>tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy the mule</p>\n<p>carried himself as though he commanded all the troops, and</p>\n<p>his harness was oiled and polished till it winked. I</p>",
        "<p>gave a cheer all by myself for Billy the mule,</p>\n<p>but he never looked right or left. The rain began</p>\n<p>to fall again, and for a while it was too</p>\n<p>misty to see what the troops were doing. They had</p>\n<p>made a big half circle across the plain, and were</p>\n<p>spreading out into a line. That line grew and grew</p>\n<p>and grew till it was three-quarters of a mile long</p>",
        "<p>from wing to wing--one solid wall of men, horses, and</p>\n<p>guns. Then it came on straight toward the Viceroy and</p>\n<p>the Amir, and as it got nearer the ground began</p>\n<p>to shake, like the deck of a steamer when the</p>\n<p>engines are going fast. Unless you have been there you</p>\n<p>cannot imagine what a frightening effect this steady come-down of</p>\n<p>troops has on the spectators, even when they know it</p>",
        "<p>is only a review. I looked at the Amir. Up</p>\n<p>till then he had not shown the shadow of a</p>\n<p>sign of astonishment or anything else. But now his eyes</p>\n<p>began to get bigger and bigger, and he picked up</p>\n<p>the reins on his horse’s neck and looked behind him.</p>\n<p>For a minute it seemed as though he were going</p>\n<p>to draw his sword and slash his way out through</p>",
        "<p>the English men and women in the carriages at the</p>\n<p>back. Then the advance stopped dead, the ground stood still,</p>\n<p>the whole line saluted, and thirty bands began to play</p>\n<p>all together. That was the end of the review, and</p>\n<p>the regiments went off to their camps in the rain,</p>\n<p>and an infantry band struck up with-- The animals went</p>\n<p>in two by two, Hurrah! The animals went in two</p>",
        "<p>by two, The elephant and the battery mul’, and they</p>\n<p>all got into the Ark For to get out of</p>\n<p>the rain! Then I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central</p>\n<p>Asian chief, who had come down with the Amir, asking</p>\n<p>questions of a native officer. “Now,” said he, “in what</p>\n<p>manner was this wonderful thing done?” And the officer answered,</p>\n<p>“An order was given, and they obeyed.” “But are the</p>",
        "<p>beasts as wise as the men?” said the chief. “They</p>\n<p>obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock,</p>\n<p>he obeys his driver, and the driver his sergeant, and</p>\n<p>the sergeant his lieutenant, and the lieutenant his captain, and</p>\n<p>the captain his major, and the major his colonel, and</p>\n<p>the colonel his brigadier commanding three regiments, and the brigadier</p>\n<p>the general, who obeys the Viceroy, who is the servant</p>",
        "<p>of the Empress. Thus it is done.” “Would it were</p>\n<p>so in Afghanistan!” said the chief, “for there we obey</p>\n<p>only our own wills.” “And for that reason,” said the</p>\n<p>native officer, twirling his mustache, “your Amir whom you do</p>\n<p>not obey must come here and take orders from our</p>\n<p>Viceroy.” Parade Song of the Camp Animals ELEPHANTS OF THE</p>\n<p>GUN TEAMS We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,</p>",

General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor</p>\n<p>Michael S.

Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance</p>\n<p>with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our</p>\n<p>website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.
