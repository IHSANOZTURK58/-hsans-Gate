        "<h3>Chapter I: The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow</h3>\n<p>Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having</p>\n<p>asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from</p>\n<p>the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the</p>\n<p>island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I</p>\n<p>take up my pen in the year of grace 17—, and go back to the time when</p>\n<p>my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the</p>",
        "<p>sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.</p>\n<p>I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the</p>\n<p>inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a</p>\n<p>tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the</p>\n<p>shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with</p>\n<p>black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid</p>\n<p>white. I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself</p>",
        "<p>as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so</p>\n<p>often afterwards:</p>\n<p>“Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--</p>\n<p>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”</p>\n<p>in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and</p>\n<p>broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of</p>\n<p>stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,</p>",
        "<p>called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,</p>\n<p>he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still</p>\n<p>looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.</p>\n<p>“This is a handy cove,” says he at length; “and a pleasant sittyated</p>\n<p>grog-shop. Much company, mate?”</p>\n<p>My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” said he, “this is the berth for me. Here you, matey,” he</p>",
        "<p>cried to the man who trundled the barrow; “bring up alongside and help</p>\n<p>up my chest. I’ll stay here a bit,” he continued. “I’m a plain man; rum</p>\n<p>and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch</p>\n<p>ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I</p>\n<p>see what you’re at--there”; and he threw down three or four gold pieces</p>\n<p>on the threshold. “You can tell me when I’ve worked through that,” says</p>\n<p>he, looking as fierce as a commander.</p>",
        "<p>And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none</p>\n<p>of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like</p>\n<p>a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came</p>\n<p>with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at</p>\n<p>the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the</p>\n<p>coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as</p>\n<p>lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And</p>",
        "<p>that was all we could learn of our guest.</p>\n<p>He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or</p>\n<p>upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner</p>\n<p>of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly</p>\n<p>he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and</p>\n<p>blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came</p>\n<p>about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back</p>",
        "<p>from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the</p>\n<p>road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind</p>\n<p>that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was</p>\n<p>desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow</p>\n<p>(as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he</p>\n<p>would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the</p>\n<p>parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such</p>",
        "<p>was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for</p>\n<p>I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day</p>\n<p>and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I</p>\n<p>would only keep my “weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg”</p>\n<p>and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first</p>\n<p>of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only</p>\n<p>blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was</p>",
        "<p>out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and</p>\n<p>repeat his orders to look out for “the seafaring man with one leg.”</p>\n<p>How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On</p>\n<p>stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and</p>\n<p>the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a</p>\n<p>thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg</p>\n<p>would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous</p>",
        "<p>kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the</p>\n<p>middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and</p>\n<p>ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for</p>\n<p>my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.</p>\n<p>But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one</p>\n<p>leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who</p>\n<p>knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water</p>",
        "<p>than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his</p>\n<p>wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call</p>\n<p>for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his</p>\n<p>stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house</p>\n<p>shaking with “Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,” all the neighbours joining</p>\n<p>in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing</p>\n<p>louder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most</p>",
        "<p>overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for</p>\n<p>silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question,</p>\n<p>or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not</p>\n<p>following his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he</p>\n<p>had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.</p>\n<p>His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories</p>\n<p>they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and</p>",
        "<p>the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his</p>\n<p>own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men</p>\n<p>that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told</p>\n<p>these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the</p>\n<p>crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be</p>\n<p>ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over</p>\n<p>and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his</p>",
        "<p>presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking</p>\n<p>back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country</p>\n<p>life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to</p>\n<p>admire him, calling him a “true sea-dog” and a “real old salt” and</p>\n<p>such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England</p>\n<p>terrible at sea.</p>\n<p>In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week</p>",
        "<p>after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had</p>\n<p>been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to</p>\n<p>insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through</p>\n<p>his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor</p>\n<p>father out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a</p>\n<p>rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have</p>\n<p>greatly hastened his early and unhappy death.</p>",
        "<p>All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his</p>\n<p>dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his</p>\n<p>hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it</p>\n<p>was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his</p>\n<p>coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before</p>\n<p>the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter,</p>\n<p>and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the</p>",
        "<p>most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had</p>\n<p>ever seen open.</p>\n<p>He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor</p>\n<p>father was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came</p>\n<p>late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my</p>\n<p>mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should</p>\n<p>come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I</p>",
        "<p>followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright</p>\n<p>doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and</p>\n<p>pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,</p>\n<p>with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,</p>\n<p>far gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain,</p>\n<p>that is--began to pipe up his eternal song:</p>\n<p>“Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--</p>",
        "<p>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!</p>\n<p>Drink and the devil had done for the rest--</p>\n<p>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”</p>\n<p>At first I had supposed “the dead man’s chest” to be that identical big</p>\n<p>box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled</p>\n<p>in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this</p>\n<p>time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it</p>",
        "<p>was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it</p>\n<p>did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite</p>\n<p>angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on</p>\n<p>a new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually</p>\n<p>brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon</p>\n<p>the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices</p>\n<p>stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey’s; he went on as before speaking</p>",
        "<p>clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or</p>\n<p>two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,</p>\n<p>glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,</p>\n<p>“Silence, there, between decks!”</p>\n<p>“Were you addressing me, sir?” says the doctor; and when the ruffian had</p>\n<p>told him, with another oath, that this was so, “I have only one thing to</p>\n<p>say to you, sir,” replies the doctor, “that if you keep on drinking rum,</p>",
        "<p>the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!”</p>\n<p>The old fellow’s fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened</p>\n<p>a sailor’s clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,</p>\n<p>threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.</p>\n<p>The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his</p>\n<p>shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the</p>\n<p>room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: “If you do not put that</p>",
        "<p>knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall</p>\n<p>hang at the next assizes.”</p>\n<p>Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon</p>\n<p>knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like</p>\n<p>a beaten dog.</p>\n<p>“And now, sir,” continued the doctor, “since I now know there’s such a</p>\n<p>fellow in my district, you may count I’ll have an eye upon you day and</p>",
        "<p>night. I’m not a doctor only; I’m a magistrate; and if I catch a breath</p>\n<p>of complaint against you, if it’s only for a piece of incivility like</p>\n<p>tonight’s, I’ll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed</p>\n<p>out of this. Let that suffice.”</p>\n<p>Soon after, Dr. Livesey’s horse came to the door and he rode away, but</p>\n<p>the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter II: Black Dog Appears and Disappears</h3>\n<p>It was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the</p>\n<p>mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you</p>\n<p>will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard</p>\n<p>frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor</p>\n<p>father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother</p>\n<p>and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without</p>",
        "<p>paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.</p>\n<p>It was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the</p>\n<p>cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones,</p>\n<p>the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to</p>\n<p>seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the</p>\n<p>beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,</p>\n<p>his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I</p>",
        "<p>remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and</p>\n<p>the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort</p>\n<p>of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.</p>\n<p>Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the</p>\n<p>breakfast-table against the captain’s return when the parlour door</p>\n<p>opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He</p>\n<p>was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and</p>",
        "<p>though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I</p>\n<p>had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I</p>\n<p>remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a</p>\n<p>smack of the sea about him too.</p>\n<p>I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but</p>\n<p>as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table</p>\n<p>and motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my</p>",
        "<p>hand.</p>\n<p>“Come here, sonny,” says he. “Come nearer here.”</p>\n<p>I took a step nearer.</p>\n<p>“Is this here table for my mate Bill?” he asked with a kind of leer.</p>\n<p>I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who</p>\n<p>stayed in our house whom we called the captain.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said he, “my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like</p>",
        "<p>as not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,</p>\n<p>particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We’ll put it, for argument</p>\n<p>like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we’ll put it, if you</p>\n<p>like, that that cheek’s the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my</p>\n<p>mate Bill in this here house?”</p>\n<p>I told him he was out walking.</p>\n<p>“Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?”</p>",
        "<p>And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was</p>\n<p>likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions,</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said he, “this’ll be as good as drink to my mate Bill.”</p>\n<p>The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all</p>\n<p>pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was</p>\n<p>mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of</p>\n<p>mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The</p>",
        "<p>stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the</p>\n<p>corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into</p>\n<p>the road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick</p>\n<p>enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face,</p>\n<p>and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I</p>\n<p>was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half</p>\n<p>sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had</p>",
        "<p>taken quite a fancy to me. “I have a son of my own,” said he, “as like</p>\n<p>you as two blocks, and he’s all the pride of my ’art. But the great</p>\n<p>thing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailed</p>\n<p>along of Bill, you wouldn’t have stood there to be spoke to twice--not</p>\n<p>you. That was never Bill’s way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him.</p>\n<p>And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm,</p>\n<p>bless his old ’art, to be sure. You and me’ll just go back into the</p>",
        "<p>parlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we’ll give Bill a little</p>\n<p>surprise--bless his ’art, I say again.”</p>\n<p>So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me</p>\n<p>behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. I</p>\n<p>was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my</p>\n<p>fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. He</p>\n<p>cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath;</p>",
        "<p>and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt</p>\n<p>what we used to call a lump in the throat.</p>\n<p>At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without</p>\n<p>looking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to</p>\n<p>where his breakfast awaited him.</p>\n<p>“Bill,” said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make</p>\n<p>bold and big.</p>",
        "<p>The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had</p>\n<p>gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a</p>\n<p>man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything</p>\n<p>can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn</p>\n<p>so old and sick.</p>\n<p>“Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,” said</p>\n<p>the stranger.</p>",
        "<p>The captain made a sort of gasp.</p>\n<p>“Black Dog!” said he.</p>\n<p>“And who else?” returned the other, getting more at his ease. “Black</p>\n<p>Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral</p>\n<p>Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since</p>\n<p>I lost them two talons,” holding up his mutilated hand.</p>\n<p>“Now, look here,” said the captain; “you’ve run me down; here I am;</p>",
        "<p>well, then, speak up; what is it?”</p>\n<p>“That’s you, Bill,” returned Black Dog, “you’re in the right of it,</p>\n<p>Billy. I’ll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I’ve took</p>\n<p>such a liking to; and we’ll sit down, if you please, and talk square,</p>\n<p>like old shipmates.”</p>\n<p>When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side</p>\n<p>of the captain’s breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and</p>",
        "<p>sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I</p>\n<p>thought, on his retreat.</p>\n<p>He bade me go and leave the door wide open. “None of your keyholes for</p>\n<p>me, sonny,” he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar.</p>\n<p>For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear</p>\n<p>nothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher,</p>\n<p>and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.</p>",
        "<p>“No, no, no, no; and an end of it!” he cried once. And again, “If it</p>\n<p>comes to swinging, swing all, say I.”</p>\n<p>Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and</p>\n<p>other noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel</p>\n<p>followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black</p>\n<p>Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn</p>\n<p>cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just</p>",
        "<p>at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous</p>\n<p>cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been</p>\n<p>intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the</p>\n<p>notch on the lower side of the frame to this day.</p>\n<p>That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black</p>\n<p>Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and</p>\n<p>disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for</p>",
        "<p>his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then he</p>\n<p>passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into</p>\n<p>the house.</p>\n<p>“Jim,” says he, “rum”; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught</p>\n<p>himself with one hand against the wall.</p>\n<p>“Are you hurt?” cried I.</p>\n<p>“Rum,” he repeated. “I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!”</p>",
        "<p>I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen</p>\n<p>out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still</p>\n<p>getting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running</p>\n<p>in, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. At the same</p>\n<p>instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running</p>\n<p>downstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing</p>\n<p>very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible</p>",
        "<p>colour.</p>\n<p>“Dear, deary me,” cried my mother, “what a disgrace upon the house! And</p>\n<p>your poor father sick!”</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any</p>\n<p>other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with</p>\n<p>the stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his</p>\n<p>throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.</p>",
        "<p>It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey</p>\n<p>came in, on his visit to my father.</p>\n<p>“Oh, doctor,” we cried, “what shall we do? Where is he wounded?”</p>\n<p>“Wounded? A fiddle-stick’s end!” said the doctor. “No more wounded than</p>\n<p>you or I. The man has had a stroke, as I warned him. Now, Mrs. Hawkins,</p>\n<p>just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing</p>\n<p>about it. For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow’s trebly</p>",
        "<p>worthless life; Jim, you get me a basin.”</p>\n<p>When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the</p>\n<p>captain’s sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed</p>\n<p>in several places. “Here’s luck,” “A fair wind,” and “Billy Bones his</p>\n<p>fancy,” were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up</p>\n<p>near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from</p>\n<p>it--done, as I thought, with great spirit.</p>",
        "<p>“Prophetic,” said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger.</p>\n<p>“And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we’ll have a look at</p>\n<p>the colour of your blood. Jim,” he said, “are you afraid of blood?”</p>\n<p>“No, sir,” said I.</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” said he, “you hold the basin”; and with that he took his</p>\n<p>lancet and opened a vein.</p>\n<p>A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes</p>",
        "<p>and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with</p>\n<p>an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked</p>\n<p>relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise</p>\n<p>himself, crying, “Where’s Black Dog?”</p>\n<p>“There is no Black Dog here,” said the doctor, “except what you have</p>\n<p>on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke,</p>\n<p>precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will,</p>",
        "<p>dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--”</p>\n<p>“That’s not my name,” he interrupted.</p>\n<p>“Much I care,” returned the doctor. “It’s the name of a buccaneer of my</p>\n<p>acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I</p>\n<p>have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won’t kill you, but if</p>\n<p>you take one you’ll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you</p>\n<p>don’t break off short, you’ll die--do you understand that?--die, and go</p>",
        "<p>to your own place, like the man in the Bible. Come, now, make an effort.</p>\n<p>I’ll help you to your bed for once.”</p>\n<p>Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and</p>\n<p>laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he</p>\n<p>were almost fainting.</p>\n<p>“Now, mind you,” said the doctor, “I clear my conscience--the name of</p>\n<p>rum for you is death.”</p>",
        "<p>And with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the</p>\n<p>arm.</p>\n<p>“This is nothing,” he said as soon as he had closed the door. “I have</p>\n<p>drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week</p>\n<p>where he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke</p>\n<p>would settle him.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter III: The Black Spot</h3>\n<p>About noon I stopped at the captain’s door with some cooling drinks</p>\n<p>and medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little</p>\n<p>higher, and he seemed both weak and excited.</p>\n<p>“Jim,” he said, “you’re the only one here that’s worth anything, and you</p>\n<p>know I’ve been always good to you. Never a month but I’ve given you a</p>\n<p>silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I’m pretty low,</p>",
        "<p>and deserted by all; and Jim, you’ll bring me one noggin of rum, now,</p>\n<p>won’t you, matey?”</p>\n<p>“The doctor--” I began.</p>\n<p>But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily.</p>\n<p>“Doctors is all swabs,” he said; “and that doctor there, why, what do</p>\n<p>he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates</p>\n<p>dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the</p>",
        "<p>sea with earthquakes--what do the doctor know of lands like that?--and I</p>\n<p>lived on rum, I tell you. It’s been meat and drink, and man and wife,</p>\n<p>to me; and if I’m not to have my rum now I’m a poor old hulk on a lee</p>\n<p>shore, my blood’ll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab”; and he ran on</p>\n<p>again for a while with curses. “Look, Jim, how my fingers fidges,”</p>\n<p>he continued in the pleading tone. “I can’t keep ’em still, not I. I</p>\n<p>haven’t had a drop this blessed day. That doctor’s a fool, I tell you.</p>",
        "<p>If I don’t have a dram o’ rum, Jim, I’ll have the horrors; I seen some</p>\n<p>on ’em already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as</p>\n<p>plain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I’m a man that</p>\n<p>has lived rough, and I’ll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass</p>\n<p>wouldn’t hurt me. I’ll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.”</p>\n<p>He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father,</p>\n<p>who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by</p>",
        "<p>the doctor’s words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer</p>\n<p>of a bribe.</p>\n<p>“I want none of your money,” said I, “but what you owe my father. I’ll</p>\n<p>get you one glass, and no more.”</p>\n<p>When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye,” said he, “that’s some better, sure enough. And now, matey,</p>\n<p>did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?”</p>",
        "<p>“A week at least,” said I.</p>\n<p>“Thunder!” he cried. “A week! I can’t do that; they’d have the black</p>\n<p>spot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me</p>\n<p>this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn’t keep what they got, and want to</p>\n<p>nail what is another’s. Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know?</p>\n<p>But I’m a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it</p>\n<p>neither; and I’ll trick ’em again. I’m not afraid on ’em. I’ll shake out</p>",
        "<p>another reef, matey, and daddle ’em again.”</p>\n<p>As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty,</p>\n<p>holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and</p>\n<p>moving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as they</p>\n<p>were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in</p>\n<p>which they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting</p>\n<p>position on the edge.</p>",
        "<p>“That doctor’s done me,” he murmured. “My ears is singing. Lay me back.”</p>\n<p>Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his</p>\n<p>former place, where he lay for a while silent.</p>\n<p>“Jim,” he said at length, “you saw that seafaring man today?”</p>\n<p>“Black Dog?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Black Dog,” says he. “_He’s_ a bad ’un; but there’s worse that put him</p>\n<p>on. Now, if I can’t get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind</p>",
        "<p>you, it’s my old sea-chest they’re after; you get on a horse--you can,</p>\n<p>can’t you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes,</p>\n<p>I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all</p>\n<p>hands--magistrates and sich--and he’ll lay ’em aboard at the Admiral</p>\n<p>Benbow--all old Flint’s crew, man and boy, all on ’em that’s left. I was</p>\n<p>first mate, I was, old Flint’s first mate, and I’m the on’y one as knows</p>\n<p>the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I</p>",
        "<p>was to now, you see. But you won’t peach unless they get the black spot</p>\n<p>on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with</p>\n<p>one leg, Jim--him above all.”</p>\n<p>“But what is the black spot, captain?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“That’s a summons, mate. I’ll tell you if they get that. But you keep</p>\n<p>your weather-eye open, Jim, and I’ll share with you equals, upon my</p>\n<p>honour.”</p>",
        "<p>He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I</p>\n<p>had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark,</p>\n<p>“If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it’s me,” he fell at last into a heavy,</p>\n<p>swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all</p>\n<p>gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to</p>\n<p>the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of</p>\n<p>his confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor</p>",
        "<p>father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters</p>\n<p>on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the</p>\n<p>arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on</p>\n<p>in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of</p>\n<p>the captain, far less to be afraid of him.</p>\n<p>He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual,</p>\n<p>though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of</p>",
        "<p>rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through</p>\n<p>his nose, and no one dared to cross him. On the night before the funeral</p>\n<p>he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning,</p>\n<p>to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was,</p>\n<p>we were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly</p>\n<p>taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after</p>\n<p>my father’s death. I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he</p>",
        "<p>seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. He clambered up</p>\n<p>and down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again,</p>\n<p>and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to</p>\n<p>the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man</p>\n<p>on a steep mountain. He never particularly addressed me, and it is my</p>\n<p>belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was</p>\n<p>more flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than</p>",
        "<p>ever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his</p>\n<p>cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But with all that,</p>\n<p>he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather</p>\n<p>wandering. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a</p>\n<p>different air, a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in</p>\n<p>his youth before he had begun to follow the sea.</p>\n<p>So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three</p>",
        "<p>o’clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door</p>\n<p>for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone</p>\n<p>drawing slowly near along the road. He was plainly blind, for he tapped</p>\n<p>before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and</p>\n<p>nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge</p>\n<p>old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively</p>\n<p>deformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure.</p>",
        "<p>He stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd</p>\n<p>sing-song, addressed the air in front of him, “Will any kind friend</p>\n<p>inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in</p>\n<p>the gracious defence of his native country, England--and God bless King</p>\n<p>George!--where or in what part of this country he may now be?”</p>\n<p>“You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man,” said I.</p>\n<p>“I hear a voice,” said he, “a young voice. Will you give me your hand,</p>",
        "<p>my kind young friend, and lead me in?”</p>\n<p>I held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature</p>\n<p>gripped it in a moment like a vise. I was so much startled that I</p>\n<p>struggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him with</p>\n<p>a single action of his arm.</p>\n<p>“Now, boy,” he said, “take me in to the captain.”</p>\n<p>“Sir,” said I, “upon my word I dare not.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh,” he sneered, “that’s it! Take me in straight or I’ll break your</p>\n<p>arm.”</p>\n<p>And he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out.</p>\n<p>“Sir,” said I, “it is for yourself I mean. The captain is not what he</p>\n<p>used to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass. Another gentleman--”</p>\n<p>“Come, now, march,” interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so cruel,</p>\n<p>and cold, and ugly as that blind man’s. It cowed me more than the pain,</p>",
        "<p>and I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and</p>\n<p>towards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed</p>\n<p>with rum. The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist</p>\n<p>and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. “Lead me</p>\n<p>straight up to him, and when I’m in view, cry out, ‘Here’s a friend</p>\n<p>for you, Bill.’ If you don’t, I’ll do this,” and with that he gave me a</p>\n<p>twitch that I thought would have made me faint. Between this and that, I</p>",
        "<p>was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of</p>\n<p>the captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words he</p>\n<p>had ordered in a trembling voice.</p>\n<p>The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of</p>\n<p>him and left him staring sober. The expression of his face was not so</p>\n<p>much of terror as of mortal sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I</p>\n<p>do not believe he had enough force left in his body.</p>",
        "<p>“Now, Bill, sit where you are,” said the beggar. “If I can’t see, I can</p>\n<p>hear a finger stirring. Business is business. Hold out your left hand.</p>\n<p>Boy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right.”</p>\n<p>We both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something from the</p>\n<p>hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain’s,</p>\n<p>which closed upon it instantly.</p>\n<p>“And now that’s done,” said the blind man; and at the words he suddenly</p>",
        "<p>left hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness,</p>\n<p>skipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as I still stood</p>\n<p>motionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance.</p>\n<p>It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our</p>\n<p>senses, but at length, and about at the same moment, I released his</p>\n<p>wrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand and looked</p>\n<p>sharply into the palm.</p>",
        "<p>“Ten o’clock!” he cried. “Six hours. We’ll do them yet,” and he sprang</p>\n<p>to his feet.</p>\n<p>Even as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood swaying</p>\n<p>for a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from his whole</p>\n<p>height face foremost to the floor.</p>\n<p>I ran to him at once, calling to my mother. But haste was all in vain.</p>\n<p>The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy. It is a curious</p>",
        "<p>thing to understand, for I had certainly never liked the man, though of</p>\n<p>late I had begun to pity him, but as soon as I saw that he was dead, I</p>\n<p>burst into a flood of tears. It was the second death I had known, and</p>\n<p>the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter IV: The Sea-chest</h3>\n<p>I lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that I knew, and</p>\n<p>perhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once</p>\n<p>in a difficult and dangerous position. Some of the man’s money--if</p>\n<p>he had any--was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our</p>\n<p>captain’s shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black</p>\n<p>Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in</p>",
        "<p>payment of the dead man’s debts. The captain’s order to mount at</p>\n<p>once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone</p>\n<p>and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed</p>\n<p>impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall</p>\n<p>of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled</p>\n<p>us with alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by</p>\n<p>approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain</p>",
        "<p>on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar</p>\n<p>hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as</p>\n<p>the saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror. Something must speedily</p>\n<p>be resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together</p>\n<p>and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. No sooner said than done.</p>\n<p>Bare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and</p>\n<p>the frosty fog.</p>",
        "<p>The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the</p>\n<p>other side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was</p>\n<p>in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his</p>\n<p>appearance and whither he had presumably returned. We were not many</p>\n<p>minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each</p>\n<p>other and hearken. But there was no unusual sound--nothing but the low</p>\n<p>wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood.</p>",
        "<p>It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I shall</p>\n<p>never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and</p>\n<p>windows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the help we were likely</p>\n<p>to get in that quarter. For--you would have thought men would have been</p>\n<p>ashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the</p>\n<p>Admiral Benbow. The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman,</p>\n<p>and child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of</p>",
        "<p>Captain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to</p>\n<p>some there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who</p>\n<p>had been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered,</p>\n<p>besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to</p>\n<p>be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little</p>\n<p>lugger in what we called Kitt’s Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a</p>\n<p>comrade of the captain’s was enough to frighten them to death. And the</p>",
        "<p>short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several</p>\n<p>who were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey’s, which lay in another</p>\n<p>direction, not one would help us to defend the inn.</p>\n<p>They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other</p>\n<p>hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother</p>\n<p>made them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose money that</p>\n<p>belonged to her fatherless boy; “If none of the rest of you dare,”</p>",
        "<p>she said, “Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small</p>\n<p>thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We’ll have that chest</p>\n<p>open, if we die for it. And I’ll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley,</p>\n<p>to bring back our lawful money in.”</p>\n<p>Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried</p>\n<p>out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with</p>\n<p>us. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were</p>",
        "<p>attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were</p>\n<p>pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor’s</p>\n<p>in search of armed assistance.</p>\n<p>My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon</p>\n<p>this dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered</p>\n<p>redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste,</p>\n<p>for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as</p>",
        "<p>bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.</p>\n<p>We slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear</p>\n<p>anything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the</p>\n<p>Admiral Benbow had closed behind us.</p>\n<p>I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the</p>\n<p>dark, alone in the house with the dead captain’s body. Then my mother</p>\n<p>got a candle in the bar, and holding each other’s hands, we advanced</p>",
        "<p>into the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes</p>\n<p>open and one arm stretched out.</p>\n<p>“Draw down the blind, Jim,” whispered my mother; “they might come and</p>\n<p>watch outside. And now,” said she when I had done so, “we have to get</p>\n<p>the key off _that;_ and who’s to touch it, I should like to know!” and she</p>\n<p>gave a kind of sob as she said the words.</p>\n<p>I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there</p>",
        "<p>was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I could not</p>\n<p>doubt that this was the _black spot;_ and taking it up, I found written</p>\n<p>on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: “You</p>\n<p>have till ten tonight.”</p>\n<p>“He had till ten, Mother,” said I; and just as I said it, our old clock</p>\n<p>began striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news</p>\n<p>was good, for it was only six.</p>",
        "<p>“Now, Jim,” she said, “that key.”</p>\n<p>I felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a thimble,</p>\n<p>and some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away</p>\n<p>at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a</p>\n<p>tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps it’s round his neck,” suggested my mother.</p>\n<p>Overcoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and</p>",
        "<p>there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with</p>\n<p>his own gully, we found the key. At this triumph we were filled with</p>\n<p>hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had</p>\n<p>slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival.</p>\n<p>It was like any other seaman’s chest on the outside, the initial “B”</p>\n<p>burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat</p>\n<p>smashed and broken as by long, rough usage.</p>",
        "<p>“Give me the key,” said my mother; and though the lock was very stiff,</p>\n<p>she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling.</p>\n<p>A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing</p>\n<p>was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes, carefully</p>\n<p>brushed and folded. They had never been worn, my mother said. Under</p>\n<p>that, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of</p>\n<p>tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an</p>",
        "<p>old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of</p>\n<p>foreign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six</p>\n<p>curious West Indian shells. I have often wondered since why he should</p>\n<p>have carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and</p>\n<p>hunted life.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and</p>\n<p>the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath there</p>",
        "<p>was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My</p>\n<p>mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last</p>\n<p>things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like</p>\n<p>papers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of</p>\n<p>gold.</p>\n<p>“I’ll show these rogues that I’m an honest woman,” said my mother. “I’ll</p>\n<p>have my dues, and not a farthing over. Hold Mrs. Crossley’s bag.” And</p>",
        "<p>she began to count over the amount of the captain’s score from the</p>\n<p>sailor’s bag into the one that I was holding.</p>\n<p>It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries</p>\n<p>and sizes--doubloons, and louis d’ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight,</p>\n<p>and I know not what besides, all shaken together at random. The guineas,</p>\n<p>too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother</p>\n<p>knew how to make her count.</p>",
        "<p>When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her</p>\n<p>arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my</p>\n<p>heart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man’s stick upon the</p>\n<p>frozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.</p>\n<p>Then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle</p>\n<p>being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter;</p>\n<p>and then there was a long time of silence both within and without.</p>",
        "<p>At last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and</p>\n<p>gratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.</p>\n<p>“Mother,” said I, “take the whole and let’s be going,” for I was sure</p>\n<p>the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole</p>\n<p>hornet’s nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had</p>\n<p>bolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man.</p>\n<p>But my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a</p>",
        "<p>fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be</p>\n<p>content with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she</p>\n<p>knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with</p>\n<p>me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. That</p>\n<p>was enough, and more than enough, for both of us.</p>\n<p>“I’ll take what I have,” she said, jumping to her feet.</p>\n<p>“And I’ll take this to square the count,” said I, picking up the oilskin</p>",
        "<p>packet.</p>\n<p>Next moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle by</p>\n<p>the empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in full</p>\n<p>retreat. We had not started a moment too soon. The fog was rapidly</p>\n<p>dispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on</p>\n<p>either side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round</p>\n<p>the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the</p>",
        "<p>first steps of our escape. Far less than half-way to the hamlet, very</p>\n<p>little beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come forth into the</p>\n<p>moonlight. Nor was this all, for the sound of several footsteps running</p>\n<p>came already to our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a</p>\n<p>light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of</p>\n<p>the newcomers carried a lantern.</p>\n<p>“My dear,” said my mother suddenly, “take the money and run on. I am</p>",
        "<p>going to faint.”</p>\n<p>This was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the</p>\n<p>cowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty</p>\n<p>and her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were</p>\n<p>just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering</p>\n<p>as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh</p>\n<p>and fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it</p>",
        "<p>at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her</p>\n<p>down the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move</p>\n<p>her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it.</p>\n<p>So there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of</p>\n<p>us within earshot of the inn.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter V: The Last of the Blind Man</h3>\n<p>My curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not</p>\n<p>remain where I was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering</p>\n<p>my head behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our</p>\n<p>door. I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven</p>\n<p>or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along</p>\n<p>the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran</p>",
        "<p>together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the</p>\n<p>middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice</p>\n<p>showed me that I was right.</p>\n<p>“Down with the door!” he cried.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the</p>\n<p>Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see</p>\n<p>them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were</p>",
        "<p>surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind</p>\n<p>man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as</p>\n<p>if he were afire with eagerness and rage.</p>\n<p>“In, in, in!” he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.</p>\n<p>Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the</p>\n<p>formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a</p>\n<p>voice shouting from the house, “Bill’s dead.”</p>",
        "<p>But the blind man swore at them again for their delay.</p>\n<p>“Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and</p>\n<p>get the chest,” he cried.</p>\n<p>I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the</p>\n<p>house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of</p>\n<p>astonishment arose; the window of the captain’s room was thrown open</p>\n<p>with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the</p>",
        "<p>moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the</p>\n<p>road below him.</p>\n<p>“Pew,” he cried, “they’ve been before us. Someone’s turned the chest out</p>\n<p>alow and aloft.”</p>\n<p>“Is it there?” roared Pew.</p>\n<p>“The money’s there.”</p>\n<p>The blind man cursed the money.</p>",
        "<p>“Flint’s fist, I mean,” he cried.</p>\n<p>“We don’t see it here nohow,” returned the man.</p>\n<p>“Here, you below there, is it on Bill?” cried the blind man again.</p>\n<p>At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search</p>\n<p>the captain’s body, came to the door of the inn. “Bill’s been overhauled</p>\n<p>a’ready,” said he; “nothin’ left.”</p>\n<p>“It’s these people of the inn--it’s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes</p>",
        "<p>out!” cried the blind man, Pew. “There were no time ago--they had the</p>\n<p>door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find ’em.”</p>\n<p>“Sure enough, they left their glim here,” said the fellow from the</p>\n<p>window.</p>\n<p>“Scatter and find ’em! Rout the house out!” reiterated Pew, striking</p>\n<p>with his stick upon the road.</p>\n<p>Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet</p>",
        "<p>pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the</p>\n<p>very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on</p>\n<p>the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just</p>\n<p>the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead</p>\n<p>captain’s money was once more clearly audible through the night,</p>\n<p>but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man’s</p>\n<p>trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found</p>",
        "<p>that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its</p>\n<p>effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.</p>\n<p>“There’s Dirk again,” said one. “Twice! We’ll have to budge, mates.”</p>\n<p>“Budge, you skulk!” cried Pew. “Dirk was a fool and a coward from the</p>\n<p>first--you wouldn’t mind him. They must be close by; they can’t be far;</p>\n<p>you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver</p>\n<p>my soul,” he cried, “if I had eyes!”</p>",
        "<p>This appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began</p>\n<p>to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought,</p>\n<p>and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest</p>\n<p>stood irresolute on the road.</p>\n<p>“You have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You’d</p>\n<p>be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it’s here, and</p>\n<p>you stand there skulking. There wasn’t one of you dared face Bill, and</p>",
        "<p>I did it--a blind man! And I’m to lose my chance for you! I’m to be a</p>\n<p>poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a</p>\n<p>coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch</p>\n<p>them still.”</p>\n<p>“Hang it, Pew, we’ve got the doubloons!” grumbled one.</p>\n<p>“They might have hid the blessed thing,” said another. “Take the</p>\n<p>Georges, Pew, and don’t stand here squalling.”</p>",
        "<p>Squalling was the word for it; Pew’s anger rose so high at these</p>\n<p>objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand,</p>\n<p>he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded</p>\n<p>heavily on more than one.</p>\n<p>These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him</p>\n<p>in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from</p>\n<p>his grasp.</p>",
        "<p>This quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging,</p>\n<p>another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the</p>\n<p>hamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a</p>\n<p>pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was</p>\n<p>plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once</p>\n<p>and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one</p>\n<p>slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of</p>",
        "<p>them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic</p>\n<p>or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he</p>\n<p>remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping</p>\n<p>and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few</p>\n<p>steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, “Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,”</p>\n<p>and other names, “you won’t leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!”</p>\n<p>Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders</p>",
        "<p>came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.</p>\n<p>At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for</p>\n<p>the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a</p>\n<p>second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the</p>\n<p>nearest of the coming horses.</p>\n<p>The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that</p>\n<p>rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him</p>",
        "<p>and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face</p>\n<p>and moved no more.</p>\n<p>I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any</p>\n<p>rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One,</p>\n<p>tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to</p>\n<p>Dr. Livesey’s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the</p>\n<p>way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some</p>",
        "<p>news of the lugger in Kitt’s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance</p>\n<p>and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance</p>\n<p>my mother and I owed our preservation from death.</p>\n<p>Pew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up</p>\n<p>to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her</p>\n<p>back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still</p>\n<p>continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the</p>",
        "<p>supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt’s Hole; but his men</p>\n<p>had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes</p>\n<p>supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was</p>\n<p>no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the</p>\n<p>lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A</p>\n<p>voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get</p>\n<p>some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his</p>",
        "<p>arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance</p>\n<p>stood there, as he said, “like a fish out of water,” and all he could do</p>\n<p>was to dispatch a man to B---- to warn the cutter. “And that,” said he,</p>\n<p>“is just about as good as nothing. They’ve got off clean, and there’s</p>\n<p>an end. Only,” he added, “I’m glad I trod on Master Pew’s corns,” for by</p>\n<p>this time he had heard my story.</p>\n<p>I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a</p>",
        "<p>house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down</p>\n<p>by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself;</p>\n<p>and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain’s</p>\n<p>money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we</p>\n<p>were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.</p>\n<p>“They got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were</p>\n<p>they after? More money, I suppose?”</p>",
        "<p>“No, sir; not money, I think,” replied I. “In fact, sir, I believe I</p>\n<p>have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should</p>\n<p>like to get it put in safety.”</p>\n<p>“To be sure, boy; quite right,” said he. “I’ll take it, if you like.”</p>\n<p>“I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--” I began.</p>\n<p>“Perfectly right,” he interrupted very cheerily, “perfectly right--a</p>\n<p>gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as</p>",
        "<p>well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew’s</p>\n<p>dead, when all’s done; not that I regret it, but he’s dead, you see, and</p>\n<p>people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty’s revenue,</p>\n<p>if make it out they can. Now, I’ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I’ll</p>\n<p>take you along.”</p>\n<p>I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet</p>\n<p>where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they</p>",
        "<p>were all in the saddle.</p>\n<p>“Dogger,” said Mr. Dance, “you have a good horse; take up this lad</p>\n<p>behind you.”</p>\n<p>As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger’s belt, the supervisor</p>\n<p>gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road</p>\n<p>to Dr. Livesey’s house.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VI: The Captain’s Papers</h3>\n<p>We rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey’s door. The</p>\n<p>house was all dark to the front.</p>\n<p>Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup</p>\n<p>to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid.</p>\n<p>“Is Dr. Livesey in?” I asked.</p>\n<p>No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the</p>",
        "<p>hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire.</p>\n<p>“So there we go, boys,” said Mr. Dance.</p>\n<p>This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with</p>\n<p>Dogger’s stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless,</p>\n<p>moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on</p>\n<p>either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking</p>\n<p>me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house.</p>",
        "<p>The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a</p>\n<p>great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them,</p>\n<p>where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a</p>\n<p>bright fire.</p>\n<p>I had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man, over six</p>\n<p>feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready</p>\n<p>face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. His</p>",
        "<p>eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of</p>\n<p>some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.</p>\n<p>“Come in, Mr. Dance,” says he, very stately and condescending.</p>\n<p>“Good evening, Dance,” says the doctor with a nod. “And good evening to</p>\n<p>you, friend Jim. What good wind brings you here?”</p>\n<p>The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a</p>\n<p>lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward</p>",
        "<p>and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and</p>\n<p>interest. When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr.</p>\n<p>Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried “Bravo!” and</p>\n<p>broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr.</p>\n<p>Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire’s name) had got up</p>\n<p>from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to</p>\n<p>hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking</p>",
        "<p>very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.</p>\n<p>At last Mr. Dance finished the story.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Dance,” said the squire, “you are a very noble fellow. And as for</p>\n<p>riding down that black, atrocious miscreant, I regard it as an act of</p>\n<p>virtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach. This lad Hawkins is a trump,</p>\n<p>I perceive. Hawkins, will you ring that bell? Mr. Dance must have some</p>\n<p>ale.”</p>",
        "<p>“And so, Jim,” said the doctor, “you have the thing that they were</p>\n<p>after, have you?”</p>\n<p>“Here it is, sir,” said I, and gave him the oilskin packet.</p>\n<p>The doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open</p>\n<p>it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his</p>\n<p>coat.</p>\n<p>“Squire,” said he, “when Dance has had his ale he must, of course, be</p>",
        "<p>off on his Majesty’s service; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to</p>\n<p>sleep at my house, and with your permission, I propose we should have up</p>\n<p>the cold pie and let him sup.”</p>\n<p>“As you will, Livesey,” said the squire; “Hawkins has earned better than</p>\n<p>cold pie.”</p>\n<p>So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and I made</p>\n<p>a hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a hawk, while Mr. Dance was</p>",
        "<p>further complimented and at last dismissed.</p>\n<p>“And now, squire,” said the doctor.</p>\n<p>“And now, Livesey,” said the squire in the same breath.</p>\n<p>“One at a time, one at a time,” laughed Dr. Livesey. “You have heard of</p>\n<p>this Flint, I suppose?”</p>\n<p>“Heard of him!” cried the squire. “Heard of him, you say! He was the</p>\n<p>bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was a child to Flint.</p>",
        "<p>The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir,</p>\n<p>I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I’ve seen his top-sails with</p>\n<p>these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I</p>\n<p>sailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ve heard of him myself, in England,” said the doctor. “But the</p>\n<p>point is, had he money?”</p>\n<p>“Money!” cried the squire. “Have you heard the story? What were these</p>",
        "<p>villains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what</p>\n<p>would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?”</p>\n<p>“That we shall soon know,” replied the doctor. “But you are so</p>\n<p>confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in.</p>\n<p>What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket</p>\n<p>some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount</p>\n<p>to much?”</p>",
        "<p>“Amount, sir!” cried the squire. “It will amount to this: If we have the</p>\n<p>clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and</p>\n<p>Hawkins here along, and I’ll have that treasure if I search a year.”</p>\n<p>“Very well,” said the doctor. “Now, then, if Jim is agreeable, we’ll</p>\n<p>open the packet”; and he laid it before him on the table.</p>\n<p>The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his</p>\n<p>instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It</p>",
        "<p>contained two things--a book and a sealed paper.</p>\n<p>“First of all we’ll try the book,” observed the doctor.</p>\n<p>The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened</p>\n<p>it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the</p>\n<p>side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search.</p>\n<p>On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man</p>\n<p>with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the</p>",
        "<p>same as the tattoo mark, “Billy Bones his fancy”; then there was “Mr. W.</p>\n<p>Bones, mate,” “No more rum,” “Off Palm Key he got itt,” and some other</p>\n<p>snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help</p>\n<p>wondering who it was that had “got itt,” and what “itt” was that he got.</p>\n<p>A knife in his back as like as not.</p>\n<p>“Not much instruction there,” said Dr. Livesey as he passed on.</p>\n<p>The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of</p>",
        "<p>entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a</p>\n<p>sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory</p>\n<p>writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th</p>\n<p>of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become</p>\n<p>due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the</p>\n<p>cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added,</p>\n<p>as “Offe Caraccas,” or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as “62o</p>",
        "<p>17′ 20″, 19o 2′ 40″.”</p>\n<p>The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate</p>\n<p>entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total</p>\n<p>had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words</p>\n<p>appended, “Bones, his pile.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t make head or tail of this,” said Dr. Livesey.</p>\n<p>“The thing is as clear as noonday,” cried the squire. “This is the</p>",
        "<p>black-hearted hound’s account-book. These crosses stand for the names of</p>\n<p>ships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel’s</p>\n<p>share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something</p>\n<p>clearer. ‘Offe Caraccas,’ now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel</p>\n<p>boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her--coral</p>\n<p>long ago.”</p>\n<p>“Right!” said the doctor. “See what it is to be a traveller. Right! And</p>",
        "<p>the amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.”</p>\n<p>There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted</p>\n<p>in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French,</p>\n<p>English, and Spanish moneys to a common value.</p>\n<p>“Thrifty man!” cried the doctor. “He wasn’t the one to be cheated.”</p>\n<p>“And now,” said the squire, “for the other.”</p>\n<p>The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of</p>",
        "<p>seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain’s</p>\n<p>pocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out</p>\n<p>the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of</p>\n<p>hills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed</p>\n<p>to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was about nine</p>\n<p>miles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon</p>\n<p>standing up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the</p>",
        "<p>centre part marked “The Spy-glass.” There were several additions of a</p>\n<p>later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink--two on the north</p>\n<p>part of the island, one in the southwest--and beside this last, in</p>\n<p>the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the</p>\n<p>captain’s tottery characters, these words: “Bulk of treasure here.”</p>\n<p>Over on the back the same hand had written this further information:</p>\n<p>Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to</p>",
        "<p>the N. of N.N.E.</p>\n<p>Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.</p>\n<p>Ten feet.</p>\n<p>The bar silver is in the north cache; you can find</p>\n<p>it by the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms</p>\n<p>south of the black crag with the face on it.</p>\n<p>The arms are easy found, in the sand-hill, N.</p>",
        "<p>point of north inlet cape, bearing E. and a</p>\n<p>quarter N.</p>\n<p>J.F.</p>\n<p>That was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible, it filled</p>\n<p>the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight.</p>\n<p>“Livesey,” said the squire, “you will give up this wretched practice</p>\n<p>at once. Tomorrow I start for Bristol. In three weeks’ time--three</p>",
        "<p>weeks!--two weeks--ten days--we’ll have the best ship, sir, and the</p>\n<p>choicest crew in England. Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy. You’ll make</p>\n<p>a famous cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, are ship’s doctor; I am</p>\n<p>admiral. We’ll take Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter. We’ll have favourable</p>\n<p>winds, a quick passage, and not the least difficulty in finding the</p>\n<p>spot, and money to eat, to roll in, to play duck and drake with ever</p>\n<p>after.”</p>",
        "<p>“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “I’ll go with you; and I’ll go bail for</p>\n<p>it, so will Jim, and be a credit to the undertaking. There’s only one</p>\n<p>man I’m afraid of.”</p>\n<p>“And who’s that?” cried the squire. “Name the dog, sir!”</p>\n<p>“You,” replied the doctor; “for you cannot hold your tongue. We are not</p>\n<p>the only men who know of this paper. These fellows who attacked the</p>\n<p>inn tonight--bold, desperate blades, for sure--and the rest who stayed</p>",
        "<p>aboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all,</p>\n<p>through thick and thin, bound that they’ll get that money. We must none</p>\n<p>of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the</p>\n<p>meanwhile; you’ll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and</p>\n<p>from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we’ve</p>\n<p>found.”</p>\n<p>“Livesey,” returned the squire, “you are always in the right of it. I’ll</p>",
        "<p>be as silent as the grave.”</p>",
        "<h3>PART TWO: The Sea-cook</h3>",
        "<h3>Chapter VII: I Go to Bristol</h3>\n<p>It was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea,</p>\n<p>and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey’s, of keeping me</p>\n<p>beside him--could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go</p>\n<p>to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was</p>\n<p>hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of</p>\n<p>old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams</p>",
        "<p>and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures.</p>\n<p>I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which</p>\n<p>I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper’s room, I</p>\n<p>approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I</p>\n<p>explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that</p>\n<p>tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most</p>\n<p>wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with</p>",
        "<p>savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that</p>\n<p>hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and</p>\n<p>tragic as our actual adventures.</p>\n<p>So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed</p>\n<p>to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, “To be opened, in the case of his</p>\n<p>absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.” Obeying this order, we</p>\n<p>found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading</p>",
        "<p>anything but print--the following important news:</p>\n<p>_Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17--._</p>\n<p>Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you</p>\n<p>are at the hall or still in London, I send this in</p>\n<p>double to both places.</p>\n<p>The ship is bought and fitted.  She lies at</p>\n<p>anchor, ready for sea.  You never imagined a</p>",
        "<p>sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two</p>\n<p>hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA.</p>\n<p>I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who</p>\n<p>has proved himself throughout the most surprising</p>\n<p>trump.  The admirable fellow literally slaved in</p>\n<p>my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in</p>\n<p>Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we</p>",
        "<p>sailed for--treasure, I mean.</p>\n<p>“Redruth,” said I, interrupting the letter, “Dr. Livesey will not like</p>\n<p>that. The squire has been talking, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Well, who’s a better right?” growled the gamekeeper. “A pretty rum go</p>\n<p>if squire ain’t to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.”</p>\n<p>At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:</p>\n<p>Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and</p>",
        "<p>by the most admirable management got her for the</p>\n<p>merest trifle.  There is a class of men in Bristol</p>\n<p>monstrously prejudiced against Blandly.  They go</p>\n<p>the length of declaring that this honest creature</p>\n<p>would do anything for money, that the HISPANIOLA</p>\n<p>belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly</p>\n<p>high--the most transparent calumnies.  None of them</p>",
        "<p>dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.</p>\n<p>So far there was not a hitch.  The</p>\n<p>workpeople, to be sure--riggers and what not--were</p>\n<p>most annoyingly slow; but time cured that.  It was</p>\n<p>the crew that troubled me.</p>\n<p>I wished a round score of men--in case of</p>\n<p>natives, buccaneers, or the odious French--and I</p>",
        "<p>had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much</p>\n<p>as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke</p>\n<p>of fortune brought me the very man that I</p>\n<p>required.</p>\n<p>I was standing on the dock, when, by the</p>\n<p>merest accident, I fell in talk with him.  I found</p>\n<p>he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew</p>",
        "<p>all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his</p>\n<p>health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to</p>\n<p>get to sea again.  He had hobbled down there that</p>\n<p>morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.</p>\n<p>I was monstrously touched--so would you have</p>\n<p>been--and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the</p>\n<p>spot to be ship’s cook.  Long John Silver, he is</p>",
        "<p>called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as</p>\n<p>a recommendation, since he lost it in his</p>\n<p>country’s service, under the immortal Hawke.  He</p>\n<p>has no pension, Livesey.  Imagine the abominable</p>\n<p>age we live in!</p>\n<p>Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook,</p>\n<p>but it was a crew I had discovered.  Between</p>",
        "<p>Silver and myself we got together in a few days a</p>\n<p>company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not</p>\n<p>pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of</p>\n<p>the most indomitable spirit.  I declare we could</p>\n<p>fight a frigate.</p>\n<p>Long John even got rid of two out of the six</p>\n<p>or seven I had already engaged.  He showed me in a</p>",
        "<p>moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water</p>\n<p>swabs we had to fear in an adventure of</p>\n<p>importance.</p>\n<p>I am in the most magnificent health and</p>\n<p>spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like a tree,</p>\n<p>yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old</p>\n<p>tarpaulins tramping round the capstan.  Seaward,</p>",
        "<p>ho!  Hang the treasure!  It’s the glory of the sea</p>\n<p>that has turned my head.  So now, Livesey, come</p>\n<p>post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.</p>\n<p>Let young Hawkins go at once to see his</p>\n<p>mother, with Redruth for a guard; and then both</p>\n<p>come full speed to Bristol.</p>\n<p>John Trelawney</p>",
        "<p>_Postscript._--I did not tell you that Blandly,</p>\n<p>who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if</p>\n<p>we don’t turn up by the end of August, had found</p>\n<p>an admirable fellow for sailing master--a stiff</p>\n<p>man, which I regret, but in all other respects a</p>\n<p>treasure.  Long John Silver unearthed a very</p>\n<p>competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow.  I</p>",
        "<p>have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things</p>\n<p>shall go man-o’-war fashion on board the good ship</p>\n<p>HISPANIOLA.</p>\n<p>I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of</p>\n<p>substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has</p>\n<p>a banker’s account, which has never been</p>\n<p>overdrawn.  He leaves his wife to manage the inn;</p>",
        "<p>and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old</p>\n<p>bachelors like you and I may be excused for</p>\n<p>guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the</p>\n<p>health, that sends him back to roving.</p>\n<p>J. T.</p>\n<p>P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night with his</p>\n<p>mother.</p>",
        "<p>J. T.</p>\n<p>You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half</p>\n<p>beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old</p>\n<p>Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the</p>\n<p>under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such</p>\n<p>was not the squire’s pleasure, and the squire’s pleasure was like law</p>\n<p>among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even</p>",
        "<p>to grumble.</p>\n<p>The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and</p>\n<p>there I found my mother in good health and spirits. The captain, who had</p>\n<p>so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked</p>\n<p>cease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the</p>\n<p>public rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture--above</p>\n<p>all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy</p>",
        "<p>as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone.</p>\n<p>It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my</p>\n<p>situation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me,</p>\n<p>not at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this</p>\n<p>clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I</p>\n<p>had my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog’s life,</p>\n<p>for as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting</p>",
        "<p>him right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them.</p>\n<p>The night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were</p>\n<p>afoot again and on the road. I said good-bye to Mother and the</p>\n<p>cove where I had lived since I was born, and the dear old Admiral</p>\n<p>Benbow--since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last</p>\n<p>thoughts was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach</p>\n<p>with his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope.</p>",
        "<p>Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.</p>\n<p>The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath. I was</p>\n<p>wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the</p>\n<p>swift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from</p>\n<p>the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through</p>\n<p>stage after stage, for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch</p>\n<p>in the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still</p>",
        "<p>before a large building in a city street and that the day had already</p>\n<p>broken a long time.</p>\n<p>“Where are we?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Bristol,” said Tom. “Get down.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to</p>\n<p>superintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now to walk, and</p>\n<p>our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great</p>",
        "<p>multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors</p>\n<p>were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over</p>\n<p>my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider’s.</p>\n<p>Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been</p>\n<p>near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new.</p>\n<p>I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the</p>\n<p>ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and</p>",
        "<p>whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,</p>\n<p>clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could</p>\n<p>not have been more delighted.</p>\n<p>And I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping</p>\n<p>boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown</p>\n<p>island, and to seek for buried treasure!</p>\n<p>While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front</p>",
        "<p>of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a</p>\n<p>sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on</p>\n<p>his face and a capital imitation of a sailor’s walk.</p>\n<p>“Here you are,” he cried, “and the doctor came last night from London.</p>\n<p>Bravo! The ship’s company complete!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, sir,” cried I, “when do we sail?”</p>\n<p>“Sail!” says he. “We sail tomorrow!”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VIII: At the Sign of the Spy-glass</h3>\n<p>When I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John</p>\n<p>Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily</p>\n<p>find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright</p>\n<p>lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign. I</p>\n<p>set off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and</p>\n<p>seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and</p>",
        "<p>bales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in</p>\n<p>question.</p>\n<p>It was a bright enough little place of entertainment. The sign was</p>\n<p>newly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly</p>\n<p>sanded. There was a street on each side and an open door on both, which</p>\n<p>made the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of</p>\n<p>tobacco smoke.</p>",
        "<p>The customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so loudly that</p>\n<p>I hung at the door, almost afraid to enter.</p>\n<p>As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was</p>\n<p>sure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip,</p>\n<p>and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with</p>\n<p>wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall</p>\n<p>and strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but intelligent</p>",
        "<p>and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling</p>\n<p>as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the</p>\n<p>shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.</p>\n<p>Now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in</p>\n<p>Squire Trelawney’s letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might</p>\n<p>prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at</p>\n<p>the old Benbow. But one look at the man before me was enough. I had seen</p>",
        "<p>the captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew</p>\n<p>what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,</p>\n<p>from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.</p>\n<p>I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up</p>\n<p>to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Silver, sir?” I asked, holding out the note.</p>\n<p>“Yes, my lad,” said he; “such is my name, to be sure. And who may you</p>",
        "<p>be?” And then as he saw the squire’s letter, he seemed to me to give</p>\n<p>something almost like a start.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. “I see. You are our</p>\n<p>new cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you.”</p>\n<p>And he took my hand in his large firm grasp.</p>\n<p>Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made</p>\n<p>for the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the street in a</p>",
        "<p>moment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I recognized him at</p>\n<p>glance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come</p>\n<p>first to the Admiral Benbow.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” I cried, “stop him! It’s Black Dog!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care two coppers who he is,” cried Silver. “But he hasn’t paid</p>\n<p>his score. Harry, run and catch him.”</p>\n<p>One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in</p>",
        "<p>pursuit.</p>\n<p>“If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,” cried Silver; and</p>\n<p>then, relinquishing my hand, “Who did you say he was?” he asked. “Black</p>\n<p>what?”</p>\n<p>“Dog, sir,” said I. “Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers?</p>\n<p>He was one of them.”</p>\n<p>“So?” cried Silver. “In my house! Ben, run and help Harry. One of those</p>",
        "<p>swabs, was he? Was that you drinking with him, Morgan? Step up here.”</p>\n<p>The man whom he called Morgan--an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced</p>\n<p>sailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid.</p>\n<p>“Now, Morgan,” said Long John very sternly, “you never clapped your eyes</p>\n<p>on that Black--Black Dog before, did you, now?”</p>\n<p>“Not I, sir,” said Morgan with a salute.</p>\n<p>“You didn’t know his name, did you?”</p>",
        "<p>“No, sir.”</p>\n<p>“By the powers, Tom Morgan, it’s as good for you!” exclaimed the</p>\n<p>landlord. “If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would</p>\n<p>never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. And what</p>\n<p>was he saying to you?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t rightly know, sir,” answered Morgan.</p>\n<p>“Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?”</p>",
        "<p>cried Long John. “Don’t rightly know, don’t you! Perhaps you don’t</p>\n<p>happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come, now, what</p>\n<p>was he jawing--v’yages, cap’ns, ships? Pipe up! What was it?”</p>\n<p>“We was a-talkin’ of keel-hauling,” answered Morgan.</p>\n<p>“Keel-hauling, was you? And a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may</p>\n<p>lay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.”</p>\n<p>And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a</p>",
        "<p>confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, “He’s</p>\n<p>quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on’y stupid. And now,” he ran on again,</p>\n<p>aloud, “let’s see--Black Dog? No, I don’t know the name, not I. Yet I</p>\n<p>kind of think I’ve--yes, I’ve seen the swab. He used to come here with a</p>\n<p>blind beggar, he used.”</p>\n<p>“That he did, you may be sure,” said I. “I knew that blind man too. His</p>\n<p>name was Pew.”</p>",
        "<p>“It was!” cried Silver, now quite excited. “Pew! That were his name for</p>\n<p>certain. Ah, he looked a shark, he did! If we run down this Black Dog,</p>\n<p>now, there’ll be news for Cap’n Trelawney! Ben’s a good runner; few</p>\n<p>seamen run better than Ben. He should run him down, hand over hand, by</p>\n<p>the powers! He talked o’ keel-hauling, did he? I’LL keel-haul him!”</p>\n<p>All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and</p>\n<p>down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving</p>",
        "<p>such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge</p>\n<p>or a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on</p>\n<p>finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook narrowly. But</p>\n<p>he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time</p>\n<p>the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost</p>\n<p>the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone</p>\n<p>bail for the innocence of Long John Silver.</p>",
        "<p>“See here, now, Hawkins,” said he, “here’s a blessed hard thing on a</p>\n<p>man like me, now, ain’t it? There’s Cap’n Trelawney--what’s he to think?</p>\n<p>Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house</p>\n<p>drinking of my own rum! Here you comes and tells me of it plain; and</p>\n<p>here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights! Now,</p>\n<p>Hawkins, you do me justice with the cap’n. You’re a lad, you are, but</p>\n<p>you’re as smart as paint. I see that when you first come in. Now, here</p>",
        "<p>it is: What could I do, with this old timber I hobble on? When I was an</p>\n<p>A B master mariner I’d have come up alongside of him, hand over hand,</p>\n<p>and broached him to in a brace of old shakes, I would; but now--”</p>\n<p>And then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw dropped as though he</p>\n<p>had remembered something.</p>\n<p>“The score!” he burst out. “Three goes o’ rum! Why, shiver my timbers,</p>\n<p>if I hadn’t forgotten my score!”</p>",
        "<p>And falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>\n<p>I could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal,</p>\n<p>until the tavern rang again.</p>\n<p>“Why, what a precious old sea-calf I am!” he said at last, wiping his</p>\n<p>cheeks. “You and me should get on well, Hawkins, for I’ll take my davy</p>\n<p>I should be rated ship’s boy. But come now, stand by to go about. This</p>\n<p>won’t do. Dooty is dooty, messmates. I’ll put on my old cockerel hat,</p>",
        "<p>and step along of you to Cap’n Trelawney, and report this here affair.</p>\n<p>For mind you, it’s serious, young Hawkins; and neither you nor me’s come</p>\n<p>out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit. Nor you</p>\n<p>neither, says you; not smart--none of the pair of us smart. But dash my</p>\n<p>buttons! That was a good un about my score.”</p>\n<p>And he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though I did not</p>\n<p>see the joke as he did, I was again obliged to join him in his mirth.</p>",
        "<p>On our little walk along the quays, he made himself the most interesting</p>\n<p>companion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by,</p>\n<p>their rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going</p>\n<p>forward--how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third</p>\n<p>making ready for sea--and every now and then telling me some little</p>\n<p>anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had</p>\n<p>learned it perfectly. I began to see that here was one of the best of</p>",
        "<p>possible shipmates.</p>\n<p>When we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together,</p>\n<p>finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go</p>\n<p>aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.</p>\n<p>Long John told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit</p>\n<p>and the most perfect truth. “That was how it were, now, weren’t it,</p>\n<p>Hawkins?” he would say, now and again, and I could always bear him</p>",
        "<p>entirely out.</p>\n<p>The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all</p>\n<p>agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,</p>\n<p>Long John took up his crutch and departed.</p>\n<p>“All hands aboard by four this afternoon,” shouted the squire after him.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” cried the cook, in the passage.</p>\n<p>“Well, squire,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don’t put much faith in your</p>",
        "<p>discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>“The man’s a perfect trump,” declared the squire.</p>\n<p>“And now,” added the doctor, “Jim may come on board with us, may he</p>\n<p>not?”</p>\n<p>“To be sure he may,” says squire. “Take your hat, Hawkins, and we’ll see</p>\n<p>the ship.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter IX: Powder and Arms</h3>\n<p>The Hispaniola lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and</p>\n<p>round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated</p>\n<p>underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however,</p>\n<p>we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the</p>\n<p>mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a</p>\n<p>squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon</p>",
        "<p>observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the</p>\n<p>captain.</p>\n<p>This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on</p>\n<p>board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the</p>\n<p>cabin when a sailor followed us.</p>\n<p>“Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,” said he.</p>\n<p>“I am always at the captain’s orders. Show him in,” said the squire.</p>",
        "<p>The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and</p>\n<p>shut the door behind him.</p>\n<p>“Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all</p>\n<p>shipshape and seaworthy?”</p>\n<p>“Well, sir,” said the captain, “better speak plain, I believe, even at</p>\n<p>the risk of offence. I don’t like this cruise; I don’t like the men; and</p>\n<p>I don’t like my officer. That’s short and sweet.”</p>",
        "<p>“Perhaps, sir, you don’t like the ship?” inquired the squire, very</p>\n<p>angry, as I could see.</p>\n<p>“I can’t speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,” said the</p>\n<p>captain. “She seems a clever craft; more I can’t say.”</p>\n<p>“Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?” says the</p>\n<p>squire.</p>\n<p>But here Dr. Livesey cut in.</p>",
        "<p>“Stay a bit,” said he, “stay a bit. No use of such questions as that but</p>\n<p>to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too</p>\n<p>little, and I’m bound to say that I require an explanation of his words.</p>\n<p>You don’t, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?”</p>\n<p>“I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship</p>\n<p>for that gentleman where he should bid me,” said the captain. “So far</p>\n<p>so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I</p>",
        "<p>do. I don’t call that fair, now, do you?”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don’t.”</p>\n<p>“Next,” said the captain, “I learn we are going after treasure--hear</p>\n<p>it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don’t</p>\n<p>like treasure voyages on any account, and I don’t like them, above all,</p>\n<p>when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the</p>\n<p>secret has been told to the parrot.”</p>",
        "<p>“Silver’s parrot?” asked the squire.</p>\n<p>“It’s a way of speaking,” said the captain. “Blabbed, I mean. It’s my</p>\n<p>belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I’ll tell</p>\n<p>you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.”</p>\n<p>“That is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,” replied Dr. Livesey.</p>\n<p>“We take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us. Next,</p>\n<p>you say you don’t like the crew. Are they not good seamen?”</p>",
        "<p>“I don’t like them, sir,” returned Captain Smollett. “And I think I</p>\n<p>should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you should,” replied the doctor. “My friend should, perhaps,</p>\n<p>have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was</p>\n<p>unintentional. And you don’t like Mr. Arrow?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t, sir. I believe he’s a good seaman, but he’s too free with</p>\n<p>the crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to</p>",
        "<p>himself--shouldn’t drink with the men before the mast!”</p>\n<p>“Do you mean he drinks?” cried the squire.</p>\n<p>“No, sir,” replied the captain, “only that he’s too familiar.”</p>\n<p>“Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?” asked the doctor.</p>\n<p>“Tell us what you want.”</p>\n<p>“Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?”</p>\n<p>“Like iron,” answered the squire.</p>",
        "<p>“Very good,” said the captain. “Then, as you’ve heard me very patiently,</p>\n<p>saying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are</p>\n<p>putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good</p>\n<p>place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you</p>\n<p>are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of</p>\n<p>them are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside</p>\n<p>the cabin?--second point.”</p>",
        "<p>“Any more?” asked Mr. Trelawney.</p>\n<p>“One more,” said the captain. “There’s been too much blabbing already.”</p>\n<p>“Far too much,” agreed the doctor.</p>\n<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ve heard myself,” continued Captain Smollett:</p>\n<p>“that you have a map of an island, that there’s crosses on the map to</p>\n<p>show where treasure is, and that the island lies--” And then he named</p>\n<p>the latitude and longitude exactly.</p>",
        "<p>“I never told that,” cried the squire, “to a soul!”</p>\n<p>“The hands know it, sir,” returned the captain.</p>\n<p>“Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,” cried the squire.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t much matter who it was,” replied the doctor. And I could</p>\n<p>see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney’s</p>\n<p>protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet</p>\n<p>in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the</p>",
        "<p>situation of the island.</p>\n<p>“Well, gentlemen,” continued the captain, “I don’t know who has this</p>\n<p>map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr.</p>\n<p>Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.”</p>\n<p>“I see,” said the doctor. “You wish us to keep this matter dark and to</p>\n<p>make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend’s</p>\n<p>own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other</p>",
        "<p>words, you fear a mutiny.”</p>\n<p>“Sir,” said Captain Smollett, “with no intention to take offence, I</p>\n<p>deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be</p>\n<p>justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. As</p>\n<p>for Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the</p>\n<p>same; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship’s</p>\n<p>safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her. I see things going,</p>",
        "<p>as I think, not quite right. And I ask you to take certain precautions</p>\n<p>or let me resign my berth. And that’s all.”</p>\n<p>“Captain Smollett,” began the doctor with a smile, “did ever you hear</p>\n<p>the fable of the mountain and the mouse? You’ll excuse me, I dare say,</p>\n<p>but you remind me of that fable. When you came in here, I’ll stake my</p>\n<p>wig, you meant more than this.”</p>\n<p>“Doctor,” said the captain, “you are smart. When I came in here I meant</p>",
        "<p>to get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a</p>\n<p>word.”</p>\n<p>“No more I would,” cried the squire. “Had Livesey not been here I should</p>\n<p>have seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I will do as you</p>\n<p>desire, but I think the worse of you.”</p>\n<p>“That’s as you please, sir,” said the captain. “You’ll find I do my</p>\n<p>duty.”</p>",
        "<p>And with that he took his leave.</p>\n<p>“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “contrary to all my notions, I believed</p>\n<p>you have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and</p>\n<p>John Silver.”</p>\n<p>“Silver, if you like,” cried the squire; “but as for that intolerable</p>\n<p>humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, and downright</p>\n<p>un-English.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well,” says the doctor, “we shall see.”</p>\n<p>When we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and</p>\n<p>powder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood</p>\n<p>by superintending.</p>\n<p>The new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner had been</p>\n<p>overhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the</p>\n<p>after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to</p>",
        "<p>the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. It had</p>\n<p>been originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the</p>\n<p>doctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. Now Redruth and</p>\n<p>I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep</p>\n<p>on deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you</p>\n<p>might almost have called it a round-house. Very low it was still, of</p>\n<p>course; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate</p>",
        "<p>seemed pleased with the arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful</p>\n<p>as to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had</p>\n<p>not long the benefit of his opinion.</p>\n<p>We were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths, when</p>\n<p>the last man or two, and Long John along with them, came off in a</p>\n<p>shore-boat.</p>\n<p>The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as soon as</p>",
        "<p>he saw what was doing, “So ho, mates!” says he. “What’s this?”</p>\n<p>“We’re a-changing of the powder, Jack,” answers one.</p>\n<p>“Why, by the powers,” cried Long John, “if we do, we’ll miss the morning</p>\n<p>tide!”</p>\n<p>“My orders!” said the captain shortly. “You may go below, my man. Hands</p>\n<p>will want supper.”</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he</p>",
        "<p>disappeared at once in the direction of his galley.</p>\n<p>“That’s a good man, captain,” said the doctor.</p>\n<p>“Very likely, sir,” replied Captain Smollett. “Easy with that,</p>\n<p>men--easy,” he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and</p>\n<p>then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships,</p>\n<p>a long brass nine, “Here you, ship’s boy,” he cried, “out o’ that! Off</p>\n<p>with you to the cook and get some work.”</p>",
        "<p>And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the</p>\n<p>doctor, “I’ll have no favourites on my ship.”</p>\n<p>I assure you I was quite of the squire’s way of thinking, and hated the</p>\n<p>captain deeply.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter X: The Voyage</h3>\n<p>All that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their</p>\n<p>place, and boatfuls of the squire’s friends, Mr. Blandly and the like,</p>\n<p>coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had</p>\n<p>a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was</p>\n<p>dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe</p>\n<p>and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice</p>",
        "<p>as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and</p>\n<p>interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle,</p>\n<p>the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship’s lanterns.</p>\n<p>“Now, Barbecue, tip us a stave,” cried one voice.</p>\n<p>“The old one,” cried another.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, mates,” said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch</p>\n<p>under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so</p>",
        "<p>well:</p>\n<p>“Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--”</p>\n<p>And then the whole crew bore chorus:--</p>\n<p>“Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”</p>\n<p>And at the third “Ho!” drove the bars before them with a will.</p>\n<p>Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral</p>\n<p>Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping</p>",
        "<p>in the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging</p>\n<p>dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and</p>\n<p>shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to</p>\n<p>snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the</p>\n<p>Isle of Treasure.</p>\n<p>I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly</p>\n<p>prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable</p>",
        "<p>seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before</p>\n<p>we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened</p>\n<p>which require to be known.</p>\n<p>Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had</p>\n<p>feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they</p>\n<p>pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a</p>\n<p>day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks,</p>",
        "<p>stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time</p>\n<p>he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself;</p>\n<p>sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the</p>\n<p>companion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and</p>\n<p>attend to his work at least passably.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. That</p>\n<p>was the ship’s mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to</p>",
        "<p>solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if</p>\n<p>he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted</p>\n<p>anything but water.</p>\n<p>He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst</p>\n<p>the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself</p>\n<p>outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark</p>\n<p>night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more.</p>",
        "<p>“Overboard!” said the captain. “Well, gentlemen, that saves the trouble</p>\n<p>of putting him in irons.”</p>\n<p>But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to</p>\n<p>advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest</p>\n<p>man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as</p>\n<p>mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him</p>\n<p>very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the</p>",
        "<p>coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who</p>\n<p>could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything.</p>\n<p>He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of</p>\n<p>his name leads me on to speak of our ship’s cook, Barbecue, as the men</p>\n<p>called him.</p>\n<p>Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have</p>\n<p>both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the</p>",
        "<p>foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding</p>\n<p>to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe</p>\n<p>ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather</p>\n<p>cross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the</p>\n<p>widest spaces--Long John’s earrings, they were called; and he would hand</p>\n<p>himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it</p>\n<p>alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some</p>",
        "<p>of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see</p>\n<p>him so reduced.</p>\n<p>“He’s no common man, Barbecue,” said the coxswain to me. “He had good</p>\n<p>schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded;</p>\n<p>and brave--a lion’s nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple</p>\n<p>four and knock their heads together--him unarmed.”</p>\n<p>All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking</p>",
        "<p>to each and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was</p>\n<p>unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept</p>\n<p>as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in</p>\n<p>a cage in one corner.</p>\n<p>“Come away, Hawkins,” he would say; “come and have a yarn with John.</p>\n<p>Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the</p>\n<p>news. Here’s Cap’n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap’n Flint, after the</p>",
        "<p>famous buccaneer--here’s Cap’n Flint predicting success to our v’yage.</p>\n<p>Wasn’t you, Cap’n?”</p>\n<p>And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, “Pieces of eight! Pieces</p>\n<p>of eight! Pieces of eight!” till you wondered that it was not out of</p>\n<p>breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage.</p>\n<p>“Now, that bird,” he would say, “is, maybe, two hundred years</p>\n<p>old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody’s seen more</p>",
        "<p>wickedness, it must be the devil himself. She’s sailed with England,</p>\n<p>the great Cap’n England, the pirate. She’s been at Madagascar, and at</p>\n<p>Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the</p>\n<p>fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It’s there she learned ‘Pieces</p>\n<p>of eight,’ and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of ’em,</p>\n<p>Hawkins! She was at the boarding of the _Viceroy of the Indies_ out of</p>\n<p>Goa, she was; and to look at her you would think she was a babby. But</p>",
        "<p>you smelt powder--didn’t you, Cap’n?”</p>\n<p>“Stand by to go about,” the parrot would scream.</p>\n<p>“Ah, she’s a handsome craft, she is,” the cook would say, and give her</p>\n<p>sugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and</p>\n<p>swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. “There,” John would</p>\n<p>add, “you can’t touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. Here’s this poor old</p>\n<p>innocent bird o’ mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may</p>",
        "<p>lay to that. She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before</p>\n<p>chaplain.” And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had</p>\n<p>that made me think he was the best of men.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty</p>\n<p>distant terms with one another. The squire made no bones about the</p>\n<p>matter; he despised the captain. The captain, on his part, never spoke</p>\n<p>but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a</p>",
        "<p>word wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have</p>\n<p>been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted</p>\n<p>to see and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a</p>\n<p>downright fancy to her. “She’ll lie a point nearer the wind than a man</p>\n<p>has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. But,” he would add,</p>\n<p>“all I say is, we’re not home again, and I don’t like the cruise.”</p>\n<p>The squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck,</p>",
        "<p>chin in air.</p>\n<p>“A trifle more of that man,” he would say, “and I shall explode.”</p>\n<p>We had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the</p>\n<p>HISPANIOLA. Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have</p>\n<p>been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief</p>\n<p>there was never a ship’s company so spoiled since Noah put to sea.</p>\n<p>Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days,</p>",
        "<p>as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man’s birthday, and</p>\n<p>always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to</p>\n<p>help himself that had a fancy.</p>\n<p>“Never knew good come of it yet,” the captain said to Dr. Livesey.</p>\n<p>“Spoil forecastle hands, make devils. That’s my belief.”</p>\n<p>But good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had</p>\n<p>not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all</p>",
        "<p>have perished by the hand of treachery.</p>\n<p>This was how it came about.</p>\n<p>We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--I</p>\n<p>am not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it</p>\n<p>with a bright lookout day and night. It was about the last day of our</p>\n<p>outward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at</p>\n<p>latest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island.</p>",
        "<p>We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea.</p>\n<p>The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with</p>\n<p>a whiff of spray. All was drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the</p>\n<p>bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of</p>\n<p>our adventure.</p>\n<p>Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way</p>\n<p>to my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple. I ran on</p>",
        "<p>deck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at</p>\n<p>the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently</p>\n<p>to himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea</p>\n<p>against the bows and around the sides of the ship.</p>\n<p>In I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an</p>\n<p>apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of</p>\n<p>the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen</p>",
        "<p>asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with</p>\n<p>rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders</p>\n<p>against it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak.</p>\n<p>It was Silver’s voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would</p>\n<p>not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and</p>\n<p>listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen</p>\n<p>words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended</p>",
        "<p>upon me alone.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XI: What I Heard in the Apple-Barrel</h3>\n<p>“No, not I,” said Silver. “Flint was cap’n; I was quartermaster, along</p>\n<p>of my timber leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his</p>\n<p>deadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of</p>\n<p>college and all--Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged</p>\n<p>like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That was</p>\n<p>Roberts’ men, that was, and comed of changing names to their</p>",
        "<p>ships--ROYAL FORTUNE and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let</p>\n<p>her stay, I says. So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe</p>\n<p>home from Malabar, after England took the _Viceroy of the Indies;_ so</p>\n<p>it was with the old WALRUS, Flint’s old ship, as I’ve seen amuck with</p>\n<p>the red blood and fit to sink with gold.”</p>\n<p>“Ah!” cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and</p>\n<p>evidently full of admiration. “He was the flower of the flock, was</p>",
        "<p>Flint!”</p>\n<p>“Davis was a man too, by all accounts,” said Silver. “I never sailed</p>\n<p>along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that’s my story;</p>\n<p>and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine</p>\n<p>hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain’t bad</p>\n<p>for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. ’Tain’t earning now, it’s</p>\n<p>saving does it, you may lay to that. Where’s all England’s men now? I</p>",
        "<p>dunno. Where’s Flint’s? Why, most on ’em aboard here, and glad to get</p>\n<p>the duff--been begging before that, some on ’em. Old Pew, as had lost</p>\n<p>his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in</p>\n<p>a year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he’s dead now</p>\n<p>and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers,</p>\n<p>the man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and</p>\n<p>starved at that, by the powers!”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, it ain’t much use, after all,” said the young seaman.</p>\n<p>“’Tain’t much use for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing,”</p>\n<p>cried Silver. “But now, you look here: you’re young, you are, but you’re</p>\n<p>as smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I’ll talk</p>\n<p>to you like a man.”</p>\n<p>You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue</p>\n<p>addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used</p>",
        "<p>to myself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed</p>\n<p>him through the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was</p>\n<p>overheard.</p>\n<p>“Here it is about gentlemen of fortune. They lives rough, and they risk</p>\n<p>swinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise</p>\n<p>is done, why, it’s hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings</p>\n<p>in their pockets. Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to</p>",
        "<p>sea again in their shirts. But that’s not the course I lay. I puts it</p>\n<p>all away, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason</p>\n<p>of suspicion. I’m fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, I set up</p>\n<p>gentleman in earnest. Time enough too, says you. Ah, but I’ve lived easy</p>\n<p>in the meantime, never denied myself o’ nothing heart desires, and slep’</p>\n<p>soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea. And how did I begin?</p>\n<p>Before the mast, like you!”</p>",
        "<p>“Well,” said the other, “but all the other money’s gone now, ain’t it?</p>\n<p>You daren’t show face in Bristol after this.”</p>\n<p>“Why, where might you suppose it was?” asked Silver derisively.</p>\n<p>“At Bristol, in banks and places,” answered his companion.</p>\n<p>“It were,” said the cook; “it were when we weighed anchor. But my old</p>\n<p>missis has it all by now. And the Spy-glass is sold, lease and goodwill</p>\n<p>and rigging; and the old girl’s off to meet me. I would tell you where,</p>",
        "<p>for I trust you, but it’d make jealousy among the mates.”</p>\n<p>“And can you trust your missis?” asked the other.</p>\n<p>“Gentlemen of fortune,” returned the cook, “usually trusts little among</p>\n<p>themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. But I have a way with</p>\n<p>me, I have. When a mate brings a slip on his cable--one as knows me, I</p>\n<p>mean--it won’t be in the same world with old John. There was some that</p>\n<p>was feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint; but Flint his own</p>",
        "<p>self was feared of me. Feared he was, and proud. They was the roughest</p>\n<p>crew afloat, was Flint’s; the devil himself would have been feared to go</p>\n<p>to sea with them. Well now, I tell you, I’m not a boasting man, and you</p>\n<p>seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster,</p>\n<p>LAMBS wasn’t the word for Flint’s old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of</p>\n<p>yourself in old John’s ship.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I tell you now,” replied the lad, “I didn’t half a quarter like</p>",
        "<p>the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there’s my hand on it</p>\n<p>now.”</p>\n<p>“And a brave lad you were, and smart too,” answered Silver, shaking</p>\n<p>hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, “and a finer figurehead for</p>\n<p>a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.”</p>\n<p>By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a</p>\n<p>“gentleman of fortune” they plainly meant neither more nor less than a</p>",
        "<p>common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last</p>\n<p>act in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last</p>\n<p>one left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver</p>\n<p>giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the</p>\n<p>party.</p>\n<p>“Dick’s square,” said Silver.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I know’d Dick was square,” returned the voice of the coxswain,</p>",
        "<p>Israel Hands. “He’s no fool, is Dick.” And he turned his quid and spat.</p>\n<p>“But look here,” he went on, “here’s what I want to know, Barbecue: how</p>\n<p>long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat? I’ve had</p>\n<p>a’most enough o’ Cap’n Smollett; he’s hazed me long enough, by thunder!</p>\n<p>I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and</p>\n<p>that.”</p>\n<p>“Israel,” said Silver, “your head ain’t much account, nor ever was. But</p>",
        "<p>you’re able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough.</p>\n<p>Now, here’s what I say: you’ll berth forward, and you’ll live hard, and</p>\n<p>you’ll speak soft, and you’ll keep sober till I give the word; and you</p>\n<p>may lay to that, my son.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I don’t say no, do I?” growled the coxswain. “What I say is,</p>\n<p>when? That’s what I say.”</p>\n<p>“When! By the powers!” cried Silver. “Well now, if you want to know,</p>",
        "<p>I’ll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that’s when.</p>\n<p>Here’s a first-rate seaman, Cap’n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for</p>\n<p>us. Here’s this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don’t know</p>\n<p>where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this</p>\n<p>squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard,</p>\n<p>by the powers. Then we’ll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double</p>\n<p>Dutchmen, I’d have Cap’n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before</p>",
        "<p>I struck.”</p>\n<p>“Why, we’re all seamen aboard here, I should think,” said the lad Dick.</p>\n<p>“We’re all forecastle hands, you mean,” snapped Silver. “We can steer</p>\n<p>a course, but who’s to set one? That’s what all you gentlemen split on,</p>\n<p>first and last. If I had my way, I’d have Cap’n Smollett work us back</p>\n<p>into the trades at least; then we’d have no blessed miscalculations and</p>\n<p>a spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort you are. I’ll finish with</p>",
        "<p>’em at the island, as soon’s the blunt’s on board, and a pity it is. But</p>\n<p>you’re never happy till you’re drunk. Split my sides, I’ve a sick heart</p>\n<p>to sail with the likes of you!”</p>\n<p>“Easy all, Long John,” cried Israel. “Who’s a-crossin’ of you?”</p>\n<p>“Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard? And</p>\n<p>how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?” cried Silver.</p>\n<p>“And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I seen</p>",
        "<p>a thing or two at sea, I have. If you would on’y lay your course, and a</p>\n<p>p’int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would. But not you!</p>\n<p>I know you. You’ll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.”</p>\n<p>“Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, John; but there’s others</p>\n<p>as could hand and steer as well as you,” said Israel. “They liked a bit</p>\n<p>o’ fun, they did. They wasn’t so high and dry, nohow, but took their</p>\n<p>fling, like jolly companions every one.”</p>",
        "<p>“So?” says Silver. “Well, and where are they now? Pew was that sort,</p>\n<p>and he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah,</p>\n<p>they was a sweet crew, they was! On’y, where are they?”</p>\n<p>“But,” asked Dick, “when we do lay ’em athwart, what are we to do with</p>\n<p>’em, anyhow?”</p>\n<p>“There’s the man for me!” cried the cook admiringly. “That’s what I call</p>\n<p>business. Well, what would you think? Put ’em ashore like maroons? That</p>",
        "<p>would have been England’s way. Or cut ’em down like that much pork? That</p>\n<p>would have been Flint’s, or Billy Bones’s.”</p>\n<p>“Billy was the man for that,” said Israel. “‘Dead men don’t bite,’ says</p>\n<p>he. Well, he’s dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now;</p>\n<p>and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.”</p>\n<p>“Right you are,” said Silver; “rough and ready. But mark you here,</p>\n<p>I’m an easy man--I’m quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it’s</p>",
        "<p>serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death. When I’m in</p>\n<p>Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don’t want none of these sea-lawyers</p>\n<p>in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers.</p>\n<p>Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!”</p>\n<p>“John,” cries the coxswain, “you’re a man!”</p>\n<p>“You’ll say so, Israel when you see,” said Silver. “Only one thing I</p>\n<p>claim--I claim Trelawney. I’ll wring his calf’s head off his body with</p>",
        "<p>these hands, Dick!” he added, breaking off. “You just jump up, like a</p>\n<p>sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.”</p>\n<p>You may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for</p>\n<p>it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me.</p>\n<p>I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and</p>\n<p>the voice of Hands exclaimed, “Oh, stow that! Don’t you get sucking of</p>\n<p>that bilge, John. Let’s have a go of the rum.”</p>",
        "<p>“Dick,” said Silver, “I trust you. I’ve a gauge on the keg, mind.</p>\n<p>There’s the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.”</p>\n<p>Terrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this must</p>\n<p>have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him.</p>\n<p>Dick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke</p>\n<p>straight on in the cook’s ear. It was but a word or two that I could</p>\n<p>catch, and yet I gathered some important news, for besides other scraps</p>",
        "<p>that tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: “Not</p>\n<p>another man of them’ll jine.” Hence there were still faithful men on</p>\n<p>board.</p>\n<p>When Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and</p>\n<p>drank--one “To luck,” another with a “Here’s to old Flint,” and Silver</p>\n<p>himself saying, in a kind of song, “Here’s to ourselves, and hold your</p>\n<p>luff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.”</p>",
        "<p>Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking</p>\n<p>up, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and</p>\n<p>shining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and almost at the same time</p>\n<p>the voice of the lookout shouted, “Land ho!”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XII: Council of War</h3>\n<p>There was a great rush of feet across the deck. I could hear people</p>\n<p>tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an</p>\n<p>instant outside my barrel, I dived behind the fore-sail, made a double</p>\n<p>towards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join</p>\n<p>Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.</p>\n<p>There all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had lifted</p>",
        "<p>almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away to the</p>\n<p>south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart,</p>\n<p>and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was</p>\n<p>still buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and conical in figure.</p>\n<p>So much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my</p>\n<p>horrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the voice of</p>\n<p>Captain Smollett issuing orders. The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of</p>",
        "<p>points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the</p>\n<p>island on the east.</p>\n<p>“And now, men,” said the captain, when all was sheeted home, “has any</p>\n<p>one of you ever seen that land ahead?”</p>\n<p>“I have, sir,” said Silver. “I’ve watered there with a trader I was cook</p>\n<p>in.”</p>\n<p>“The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?” asked the</p>",
        "<p>captain.</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they calls it. It were a main place for</p>\n<p>pirates once, and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it.</p>\n<p>That hill to the nor’ard they calls the Foremast Hill; there are three</p>\n<p>hills in a row running south’ard--fore, main, and mizzen, sir. But the</p>\n<p>main--that’s the big un, with the cloud on it--they usually calls</p>\n<p>the Spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the</p>",
        "<p>anchorage cleaning, for it’s there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking</p>\n<p>your pardon.”</p>\n<p>“I have a chart here,” says Captain Smollett. “See if that’s the place.”</p>\n<p>Long John’s eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the</p>\n<p>fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This</p>\n<p>was not the map we found in Billy Bones’s chest, but an accurate copy,</p>\n<p>complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single</p>",
        "<p>exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have</p>\n<p>been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it.</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir,” said he, “this is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily</p>\n<p>drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too</p>\n<p>ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: ‘Capt. Kidd’s Anchorage’--just</p>\n<p>the name my shipmate called it. There’s a strong current runs along the</p>\n<p>south, and then away nor’ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,”</p>",
        "<p>says he, “to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island.</p>\n<p>Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there</p>\n<p>ain’t no better place for that in these waters.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you, my man,” says Captain Smollett. “I’ll ask you later on to</p>\n<p>give us a help. You may go.”</p>\n<p>I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge</p>\n<p>of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing</p>",
        "<p>nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his</p>\n<p>council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a</p>\n<p>horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal</p>\n<p>a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” says he, “this here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet spot for</p>\n<p>a lad to get ashore on. You’ll bathe, and you’ll climb trees, and you’ll</p>\n<p>hunt goats, you will; and you’ll get aloft on them hills like a goat</p>",
        "<p>yourself. Why, it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber</p>\n<p>leg, I was. It’s a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you</p>\n<p>may lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask</p>\n<p>old John, and he’ll put up a snack for you to take along.”</p>\n<p>And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off</p>\n<p>forward and went below.</p>\n<p>Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on</p>",
        "<p>the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst</p>\n<p>not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my</p>\n<p>thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his</p>\n<p>side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had</p>\n<p>meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak</p>\n<p>and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, “Doctor, let me speak. Get</p>\n<p>the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to</p>",
        "<p>send for me. I have terrible news.”</p>\n<p>The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master</p>\n<p>of himself.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Jim,” said he quite loudly, “that was all I wanted to know,”</p>\n<p>as if he had asked me a question.</p>\n<p>And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They</p>\n<p>spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised</p>",
        "<p>his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey</p>\n<p>had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the</p>\n<p>captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on</p>\n<p>deck.</p>\n<p>“My lads,” said Captain Smollett, “I’ve a word to say to you. This</p>\n<p>land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for. Mr.</p>\n<p>Trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just</p>",
        "<p>asked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell him that every man on</p>\n<p>board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I never ask to see it done</p>\n<p>better, why, he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to</p>\n<p>drink YOUR health and luck, and you’ll have grog served out for you to</p>\n<p>drink OUR health and luck. I’ll tell you what I think of this: I think</p>\n<p>it handsome. And if you think as I do, you’ll give a good sea-cheer for</p>\n<p>the gentleman that does it.”</p>",
        "<p>The cheer followed--that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full</p>\n<p>and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were</p>\n<p>plotting for our blood.</p>\n<p>“One more cheer for Cap’n Smollett,” cried Long John when the first had</p>\n<p>subsided.</p>\n<p>And this also was given with a will.</p>\n<p>On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after,</p>",
        "<p>word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin.</p>\n<p>I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine</p>\n<p>and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig</p>\n<p>on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated. The stern</p>\n<p>window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon</p>\n<p>shining behind on the ship’s wake.</p>\n<p>“Now, Hawkins,” said the squire, “you have something to say. Speak up.”</p>",
        "<p>I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole</p>\n<p>details of Silver’s conversation. Nobody interrupted me till I was done,</p>\n<p>nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but</p>\n<p>they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.</p>\n<p>“Jim,” said Dr. Livesey, “take a seat.”</p>\n<p>And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of</p>\n<p>wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other,</p>",
        "<p>and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for</p>\n<p>my luck and courage.</p>\n<p>“Now, captain,” said the squire, “you were right, and I was wrong. I own</p>\n<p>myself an ass, and I await your orders.”</p>\n<p>“No more an ass than I, sir,” returned the captain. “I never heard of a</p>\n<p>crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before, for any man that</p>\n<p>had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according. But</p>",
        "<p>this crew,” he added, “beats me.”</p>\n<p>“Captain,” said the doctor, “with your permission, that’s Silver. A very</p>\n<p>remarkable man.”</p>\n<p>“He’d look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir,” returned the captain.</p>\n<p>“But this is talk; this don’t lead to anything. I see three or four</p>\n<p>points, and with Mr. Trelawney’s permission, I’ll name them.”</p>\n<p>“You, sir, are the captain. It is for you to speak,” says Mr. Trelawney</p>",
        "<p>grandly.</p>\n<p>“First point,” began Mr. Smollett. “We must go on, because we can’t turn</p>\n<p>back. If I gave the word to go about, they would rise at once. Second</p>\n<p>point, we have time before us--at least until this treasure’s found.</p>\n<p>Third point, there are faithful hands. Now, sir, it’s got to come</p>\n<p>to blows sooner or later, and what I propose is to take time by the</p>\n<p>forelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some fine day when they</p>",
        "<p>least expect it. We can count, I take it, on your own home servants, Mr.</p>\n<p>Trelawney?”</p>\n<p>“As upon myself,” declared the squire.</p>\n<p>“Three,” reckoned the captain; “ourselves make seven, counting Hawkins</p>\n<p>here. Now, about the honest hands?”</p>\n<p>“Most likely Trelawney’s own men,” said the doctor; “those he had picked</p>\n<p>up for himself before he lit on Silver.”</p>",
        "<p>“Nay,” replied the squire. “Hands was one of mine.”</p>\n<p>“I did think I could have trusted Hands,” added the captain.</p>\n<p>“And to think that they’re all Englishmen!” broke out the squire. “Sir,</p>\n<p>I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.”</p>\n<p>“Well, gentlemen,” said the captain, “the best that I can say is not</p>\n<p>much. We must lay to, if you please, and keep a bright lookout. It’s</p>\n<p>trying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But</p>",
        "<p>there’s no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a</p>\n<p>wind, that’s my view.”</p>\n<p>“Jim here,” said the doctor, “can help us more than anyone. The men are</p>\n<p>not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.”</p>\n<p>“Hawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,” added the squire.</p>\n<p>I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether</p>\n<p>helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed</p>",
        "<p>through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there</p>\n<p>were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and</p>\n<p>out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were</p>\n<p>six to their nineteen.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter XIII: How I Began My Shore Adventure</h3>\n<p>The appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was</p>\n<p>altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had</p>\n<p>made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed</p>\n<p>about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.</p>\n<p>Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint</p>\n<p>was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands,</p>",
        "<p>and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some</p>\n<p>singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.</p>\n<p>The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.</p>\n<p>All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four</p>\n<p>hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in</p>\n<p>configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly</p>\n<p>cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.</p>",
        "<p>The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms</p>\n<p>were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the</p>\n<p>whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had</p>\n<p>to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my</p>\n<p>eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this</p>\n<p>standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never</p>\n<p>learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an</p>",
        "<p>empty stomach.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its</p>\n<p>grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we</p>\n<p>could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at</p>\n<p>least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were</p>\n<p>fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone</p>\n<p>would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart</p>",
        "<p>sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I</p>\n<p>hated the very thought of Treasure Island.</p>\n<p>We had a dreary morning’s work before us, for there was no sign of any</p>\n<p>wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped</p>\n<p>three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow</p>\n<p>passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of</p>\n<p>the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering,</p>",
        "<p>and the men grumbled fiercely over their work. Anderson was in command</p>\n<p>of my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as</p>\n<p>loud as the worst.</p>\n<p>“Well,” he said with an oath, “it’s not forever.”</p>\n<p>I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone</p>\n<p>briskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the</p>\n<p>island had relaxed the cords of discipline.</p>",
        "<p>All the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship.</p>\n<p>He knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the</p>\n<p>chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never</p>\n<p>hesitated once.</p>\n<p>“There’s a strong scour with the ebb,” he said, “and this here passage</p>\n<p>has been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.”</p>\n<p>We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of</p>",
        "<p>a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on</p>\n<p>the other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up</p>\n<p>clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a</p>\n<p>minute they were down again and all was once more silent.</p>\n<p>The place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming</p>\n<p>right down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops</p>\n<p>standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one</p>",
        "<p>there. Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this</p>\n<p>pond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore</p>\n<p>had a kind of poisonous brightness. From the ship we could see nothing</p>\n<p>of the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if</p>\n<p>it had not been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the</p>\n<p>first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the</p>\n<p>seas.</p>",
        "<p>There was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the</p>\n<p>surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks</p>\n<p>outside. A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage--a smell of</p>\n<p>sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. I observed the doctor sniffing</p>\n<p>and sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know about treasure,” he said, “but I’ll stake my wig there’s</p>\n<p>fever here.”</p>",
        "<p>If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it became truly</p>\n<p>threatening when they had come aboard. They lay about the deck growling</p>\n<p>together in talk. The slightest order was received with a black look and</p>\n<p>grudgingly and carelessly obeyed. Even the honest hands must have caught</p>\n<p>the infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another. Mutiny,</p>\n<p>it was plain, hung over us like a thunder-cloud.</p>\n<p>And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger. Long</p>",
        "<p>John was hard at work going from group to group, spending himself in</p>\n<p>good advice, and as for example no man could have shown a better. He</p>\n<p>fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all</p>\n<p>smiles to everyone. If an order were given, John would be on his crutch</p>\n<p>in an instant, with the cheeriest “Aye, aye, sir!” in the world; and</p>\n<p>when there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as</p>\n<p>if to conceal the discontent of the rest.</p>",
        "<p>Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious</p>\n<p>anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst.</p>\n<p>We held a council in the cabin.</p>\n<p>“Sir,” said the captain, “if I risk another order, the whole ship’ll</p>\n<p>come about our ears by the run. You see, sir, here it is. I get a rough</p>\n<p>answer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two</p>\n<p>shakes; if I don’t, Silver will see there’s something under that, and</p>",
        "<p>the game’s up. Now, we’ve only one man to rely on.”</p>\n<p>“And who is that?” asked the squire.</p>\n<p>“Silver, sir,” returned the captain; “he’s as anxious as you and I to</p>\n<p>smother things up. This is a tiff; he’d soon talk ’em out of it if he</p>\n<p>had the chance, and what I propose to do is to give him the chance.</p>\n<p>Let’s allow the men an afternoon ashore. If they all go, why we’ll fight</p>\n<p>the ship. If they none of them go, well then, we hold the cabin, and God</p>",
        "<p>defend the right. If some go, you mark my words, sir, Silver’ll bring</p>\n<p>’em aboard again as mild as lambs.”</p>\n<p>It was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men;</p>\n<p>Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received</p>\n<p>the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for,</p>\n<p>and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew.</p>\n<p>“My lads,” said he, “we’ve had a hot day and are all tired and out of</p>",
        "<p>sorts. A turn ashore’ll hurt nobody--the boats are still in the water;</p>\n<p>you can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the</p>\n<p>afternoon. I’ll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.”</p>\n<p>I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their</p>\n<p>shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out</p>\n<p>of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a</p>\n<p>faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the</p>",
        "<p>anchorage.</p>\n<p>The captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of sight</p>\n<p>in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as</p>\n<p>well he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as</p>\n<p>have pretended not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day.</p>\n<p>Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The</p>\n<p>honest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on</p>",
        "<p>board--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the</p>\n<p>truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the</p>\n<p>ringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in</p>\n<p>the main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing</p>\n<p>to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a</p>\n<p>number of innocent men.</p>\n<p>At last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on</p>",
        "<p>board, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark.</p>\n<p>Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions</p>\n<p>that contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were left by</p>\n<p>Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and</p>\n<p>since only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party</p>\n<p>had no present need of my assistance. It occurred to me at once to go</p>\n<p>ashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the</p>",
        "<p>fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she</p>\n<p>shoved off.</p>\n<p>No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, “Is that you, Jim?</p>\n<p>Keep your head down.” But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply</p>\n<p>over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I</p>\n<p>began to regret what I had done.</p>\n<p>The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start</p>",
        "<p>and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of</p>\n<p>her consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I</p>\n<p>had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest</p>\n<p>thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.</p>\n<p>“Jim, Jim!” I heard him shouting.</p>\n<p>But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking</p>\n<p>through, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XIV: The First Blow</h3>\n<p>I was so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to</p>\n<p>enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land</p>\n<p>that I was in.</p>\n<p>I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd,</p>\n<p>outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an</p>\n<p>open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with</p>",
        "<p>a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak</p>\n<p>in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows. On the far side of</p>\n<p>the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining</p>\n<p>vividly in the sun.</p>\n<p>I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was</p>\n<p>uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front</p>\n<p>of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the</p>",
        "<p>trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and</p>\n<p>there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and</p>\n<p>hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did</p>\n<p>I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous</p>\n<p>rattle.</p>\n<p>Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or</p>\n<p>evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew</p>",
        "<p>low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the</p>\n<p>foliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of</p>\n<p>one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until</p>\n<p>it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest</p>\n<p>of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. The marsh was</p>\n<p>steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled</p>\n<p>through the haze.</p>",
        "<p>All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes;</p>\n<p>a wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the</p>\n<p>whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and</p>\n<p>circling in the air. I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be</p>\n<p>drawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I deceived, for soon</p>\n<p>I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I</p>\n<p>continued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer.</p>",
        "<p>This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest</p>\n<p>live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.</p>\n<p>Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized</p>\n<p>to be Silver’s, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while</p>\n<p>in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound</p>\n<p>they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no</p>\n<p>distinct word came to my hearing.</p>",
        "<p>At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down,</p>\n<p>for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves</p>\n<p>began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the</p>\n<p>swamp.</p>\n<p>And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since</p>\n<p>I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the</p>\n<p>least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my</p>",
        "<p>plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the</p>\n<p>favourable ambush of the crouching trees.</p>\n<p>I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by</p>\n<p>the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that</p>\n<p>still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.</p>\n<p>Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at</p>\n<p>last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear</p>",
        "<p>down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about</p>\n<p>with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to</p>\n<p>face in conversation.</p>\n<p>The sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the</p>\n<p>ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was</p>\n<p>lifted to the other man’s in a kind of appeal.</p>\n<p>“Mate,” he was saying, “it’s because I thinks gold dust of you--gold</p>",
        "<p>dust, and you may lay to that! If I hadn’t took to you like pitch, do</p>\n<p>you think I’d have been here a-warning of you? All’s up--you can’t make</p>\n<p>nor mend; it’s to save your neck that I’m a-speaking, and if one of the</p>\n<p>wild uns knew it, where’d I be, Tom--now, tell me, where’d I be?”</p>\n<p>“Silver,” said the other man--and I observed he was not only red in the</p>\n<p>face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a</p>\n<p>taut rope--“Silver,” says he, “you’re old, and you’re honest, or has the</p>",
        "<p>name for it; and you’ve money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn’t;</p>\n<p>and you’re brave, or I’m mistook. And will you tell me you’ll let</p>\n<p>yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? Not you! As sure</p>\n<p>as God sees me, I’d sooner lose my hand. If I turn agin my dooty--”</p>\n<p>And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise. I had found</p>\n<p>one of the honest hands--well, here, at that same moment, came news of</p>\n<p>another. Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound</p>",
        "<p>like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one</p>\n<p>horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a</p>\n<p>score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening</p>\n<p>heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was</p>\n<p>still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and</p>\n<p>only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant</p>\n<p>surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon.</p>",
        "<p>Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had</p>\n<p>not winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch,</p>\n<p>watching his companion like a snake about to spring.</p>\n<p>“John!” said the sailor, stretching out his hand.</p>\n<p>“Hands off!” cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with</p>\n<p>the speed and security of a trained gymnast.</p>\n<p>“Hands off, if you like, John Silver,” said the other. “It’s a black</p>",
        "<p>conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven’s name, tell</p>\n<p>me, what was that?”</p>\n<p>“That?” returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye</p>\n<p>a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass.</p>\n<p>“That? Oh, I reckon that’ll be Alan.”</p>\n<p>And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero.</p>\n<p>“Alan!” he cried. “Then rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you,</p>",
        "<p>John Silver, long you’ve been a mate of mine, but you’re mate of mine</p>\n<p>no more. If I die like a dog, I’ll die in my dooty. You’ve killed Alan,</p>\n<p>have you? Kill me too, if you can. But I defies you.”</p>\n<p>And with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook</p>\n<p>and set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to go far.</p>\n<p>With a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of</p>\n<p>his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.</p>",
        "<p>It struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right</p>\n<p>between the shoulders in the middle of his back. His hands flew up, he</p>\n<p>gave a sort of gasp, and fell.</p>\n<p>Whether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell. Like</p>\n<p>enough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot. But he</p>\n<p>had no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a monkey even without</p>\n<p>leg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried</p>",
        "<p>his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. From my place of</p>\n<p>ambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows.</p>\n<p>I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the</p>\n<p>next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling</p>\n<p>mist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going</p>\n<p>round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells</p>\n<p>ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear.</p>",
        "<p>When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together,</p>\n<p>his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom</p>\n<p>lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit,</p>\n<p>cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass.</p>\n<p>Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the</p>\n<p>steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce</p>\n<p>persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life</p>",
        "<p>cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes.</p>\n<p>But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and</p>\n<p>blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated</p>\n<p>air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but</p>\n<p>it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be</p>\n<p>discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom</p>\n<p>and Alan, might not I come next?</p>",
        "<p>Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what</p>\n<p>speed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the</p>\n<p>wood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old</p>\n<p>buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As</p>\n<p>soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce</p>\n<p>minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the</p>\n<p>murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into</p>",
        "<p>a kind of frenzy.</p>\n<p>Indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun fired,</p>\n<p>how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still</p>\n<p>smoking from their crime? Would not the first of them who saw me wring</p>\n<p>my neck like a snipe’s? Would not my absence itself be an evidence to</p>\n<p>them of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge? It was all over,</p>\n<p>I thought. Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA; good-bye to the squire, the</p>",
        "<p>doctor, and the captain! There was nothing left for me but death by</p>\n<p>starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers.</p>\n<p>All this while, as I say, I was still running, and without taking any</p>\n<p>notice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two</p>\n<p>peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew</p>\n<p>more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and</p>\n<p>dimensions. Mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty,</p>",
        "<p>some nearer seventy, feet high. The air too smelt more freshly than down</p>\n<p>beside the marsh.</p>\n<p>And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XV: The Man of the Island</h3>\n<p>From the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of</p>\n<p>gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees.</p>\n<p>My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap</p>\n<p>with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether</p>\n<p>bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and</p>\n<p>shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought</p>",
        "<p>me to a stand.</p>\n<p>I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers,</p>\n<p>before me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer</p>\n<p>the dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared</p>\n<p>less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned</p>\n<p>on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to</p>\n<p>retrace my steps in the direction of the boats.</p>",
        "<p>Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to</p>\n<p>head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I</p>\n<p>rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an</p>\n<p>adversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running</p>\n<p>manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping</p>\n<p>almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt</p>\n<p>about that.</p>",
        "<p>I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an ace of</p>\n<p>calling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild,</p>\n<p>had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in</p>\n<p>proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of</p>\n<p>escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed</p>\n<p>into my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage</p>\n<p>glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of</p>",
        "<p>the island and walked briskly towards him.</p>\n<p>He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must</p>\n<p>have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his</p>\n<p>direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated,</p>\n<p>drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and</p>\n<p>confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in</p>\n<p>supplication.</p>",
        "<p>At that I once more stopped.</p>\n<p>“Who are you?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Ben Gunn,” he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward,</p>\n<p>like a rusty lock. “I’m poor Ben Gunn, I am; and I haven’t spoke with a</p>\n<p>Christian these three years.”</p>\n<p>I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his</p>\n<p>features were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was</p>",
        "<p>burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked</p>\n<p>quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen</p>\n<p>or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed with tatters</p>\n<p>of old ship’s canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork</p>\n<p>was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous</p>\n<p>fastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.</p>\n<p>About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the</p>",
        "<p>one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.</p>\n<p>“Three years!” I cried. “Were you shipwrecked?”</p>\n<p>“Nay, mate,” said he; “marooned.”</p>\n<p>I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of</p>\n<p>punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender</p>\n<p>is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some</p>\n<p>desolate and distant island.</p>",
        "<p>“Marooned three years agone,” he continued, “and lived on goats since</p>\n<p>then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can</p>\n<p>do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You</p>\n<p>mightn’t happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well,</p>\n<p>many’s the long night I’ve dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke</p>\n<p>up again, and here I were.”</p>\n<p>“If ever I can get aboard again,” said I, “you shall have cheese by the</p>",
        "<p>stone.”</p>\n<p>All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing</p>\n<p>my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of</p>\n<p>his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow</p>\n<p>creature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled</p>\n<p>slyness.</p>\n<p>“If ever you can get aboard again, says you?” he repeated. “Why, now,</p>",
        "<p>who’s to hinder you?”</p>\n<p>“Not you, I know,” was my reply.</p>\n<p>“And right you was,” he cried. “Now you--what do you call yourself,</p>\n<p>mate?”</p>\n<p>“Jim,” I told him.</p>\n<p>“Jim, Jim,” says he, quite pleased apparently. “Well, now, Jim, I’ve</p>\n<p>lived that rough as you’d be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you</p>",
        "<p>wouldn’t think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Why, no, not in particular,” I answered.</p>\n<p>“Ah, well,” said he, “but I had--_re_markable pious. And I was a civil,</p>\n<p>pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn’t</p>\n<p>tell one word from another. And here’s what it come to, Jim, and it</p>\n<p>begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That’s what it</p>\n<p>begun with, but it went further’n that; and so my mother told me, and</p>",
        "<p>predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence</p>\n<p>that put me here. I’ve thought it all out in this here lonely island,</p>\n<p>and I’m back on piety. You don’t catch me tasting rum so much, but just</p>\n<p>a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I’m bound</p>\n<p>I’ll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim”--looking all round him and</p>\n<p>lowering his voice to a whisper--“I’m rich.”</p>\n<p>I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and</p>",
        "<p>I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the</p>\n<p>statement hotly: “Rich! Rich! I says. And I’ll tell you what: I’ll make</p>\n<p>a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you’ll bless your stars, you will, you was</p>\n<p>the first that found me!”</p>\n<p>And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he</p>\n<p>tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly</p>\n<p>before my eyes.</p>",
        "<p>“Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain’t Flint’s ship?” he asked.</p>\n<p>At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found</p>\n<p>an ally, and I answered him at once.</p>\n<p>“It’s not Flint’s ship, and Flint is dead; but I’ll tell you true, as</p>\n<p>you ask me--there are some of Flint’s hands aboard; worse luck for the</p>\n<p>rest of us.”</p>\n<p>“Not a man--with one--leg?” he gasped.</p>",
        "<p>“Silver?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Silver!” says he. “That were his name.”</p>\n<p>“He’s the cook, and the ringleader too.”</p>\n<p>He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a</p>\n<p>wring.</p>\n<p>“If you was sent by Long John,” he said, “I’m as good as pork, and I</p>\n<p>know it. But where was you, do you suppose?”</p>",
        "<p>I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him</p>\n<p>the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found</p>\n<p>ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he</p>\n<p>patted me on the head.</p>\n<p>“You’re a good lad, Jim,” he said; “and you’re all in a clove hitch,</p>\n<p>ain’t you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn’s the man</p>\n<p>to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove</p>",
        "<p>a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you</p>\n<p>remark?”</p>\n<p>I told him the squire was the most liberal of men.</p>\n<p>“Aye, but you see,” returned Ben Gunn, “I didn’t mean giving me a gate</p>\n<p>to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that’s not my mark,</p>\n<p>Jim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say</p>\n<p>one thousand pounds out of money that’s as good as a man’s own already?”</p>",
        "<p>“I am sure he would,” said I. “As it was, all hands were to share.”</p>\n<p>“AND a passage home?” he added with a look of great shrewdness.</p>\n<p>“Why,” I cried, “the squire’s a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of</p>\n<p>the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said he, “so you would.” And he seemed very much relieved.</p>\n<p>“Now, I’ll tell you what,” he went on. “So much I’ll tell you, and no</p>\n<p>more. I were in Flint’s ship when he buried the treasure; he and</p>",
        "<p>six along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us</p>\n<p>standing off and on in the old WALRUS. One fine day up went the signal,</p>\n<p>and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in</p>\n<p>a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about</p>\n<p>the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead</p>\n<p>and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was</p>\n<p>battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy</p>",
        "<p>Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him</p>\n<p>where the treasure was. ‘Ah,’ says he, ‘you can go ashore, if you like,</p>\n<p>and stay,’ he says; ‘but as for the ship, she’ll beat up for more, by</p>\n<p>thunder!’ That’s what he said.</p>\n<p>“Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this</p>\n<p>island. ‘Boys,’ said I, ‘here’s Flint’s treasure; let’s land and find</p>\n<p>it.’ The cap’n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a</p>",
        "<p>mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had</p>\n<p>the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. ‘As</p>\n<p>for you, Benjamin Gunn,’ says they, ‘here’s a musket,’ they says, ‘and</p>\n<p>a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint’s money for</p>\n<p>yourself,’ they says.</p>\n<p>“Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian</p>\n<p>diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I</p>",
        "<p>look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren’t, neither, I</p>\n<p>says.”</p>\n<p>And with that he winked and pinched me hard.</p>\n<p>“Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim,” he went on. “Nor he</p>\n<p>weren’t, neither--that’s the words. Three years he were the man of this</p>\n<p>island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe</p>\n<p>think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of</p>",
        "<p>his old mother, so be as she’s alive (you’ll say); but the most part</p>\n<p>of Gunn’s time (this is what you’ll say)--the most part of his time was</p>\n<p>took up with another matter. And then you’ll give him a nip, like I do.”</p>\n<p>And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner.</p>\n<p>“Then,” he continued, “then you’ll up, and you’ll say this: Gunn is a</p>\n<p>good man (you’ll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a</p>\n<p>precious sight, mind that--in a gen’leman born than in these gen’leman</p>",
        "<p>of fortune, having been one hisself.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” I said, “I don’t understand one word that you’ve been saying.</p>\n<p>But that’s neither here nor there; for how am I to get on board?”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said he, “that’s the hitch, for sure. Well, there’s my boat, that</p>\n<p>I made with my two hands. I keep her under the white rock. If the worst</p>\n<p>come to the worst, we might try that after dark. Hi!” he broke out.</p>\n<p>“What’s that?”</p>",
        "<p>For just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run, all the</p>\n<p>echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.</p>\n<p>“They have begun to fight!” I cried. “Follow me.”</p>\n<p>And I began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors all forgotten,</p>\n<p>while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily</p>\n<p>and lightly.</p>\n<p>“Left, left,” says he; “keep to your left hand, mate Jim! Under the</p>",
        "<p>trees with you! Theer’s where I killed my first goat. They don’t come</p>\n<p>down here now; they’re all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear</p>\n<p>of Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And there’s the cetemery”--cemetery, he must have</p>\n<p>meant. “You see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when</p>\n<p>I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren’t quite a chapel,</p>\n<p>but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was</p>\n<p>short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.”</p>",
        "<p>So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer.</p>\n<p>The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley</p>\n<p>of small arms.</p>\n<p>Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I</p>\n<p>beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood.</p>",
        "<h3>PART FOUR: The Stockade</h3>",
        "<h3>Chapter XVI: Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned</h3>\n<p>It was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two</p>\n<p>boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I</p>\n<p>were talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind,</p>\n<p>we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with</p>\n<p>us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was wanting; and</p>\n<p>to complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim</p>",
        "<p>Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.</p>\n<p>It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were alarmed for</p>\n<p>his safety. With the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even</p>\n<p>chance if we should see the lad again. We ran on deck. The pitch was</p>\n<p>bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;</p>\n<p>if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable</p>\n<p>anchorage. The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the</p>",
        "<p>forecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting</p>\n<p>in each, hard by where the river runs in. One of them was whistling</p>\n<p>“Lillibullero.”</p>\n<p>Waiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go</p>\n<p>ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information.</p>\n<p>The gigs had leaned to their right, but Hunter and I pulled straight in,</p>\n<p>in the direction of the stockade upon the chart. The two who were</p>",
        "<p>left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance;</p>\n<p>“Lillibullero” stopped off, and I could see the pair discussing what</p>\n<p>they ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver, all might have turned</p>\n<p>out differently; but they had their orders, I suppose, and decided to</p>\n<p>sit quietly where they were and hark back again to “Lillibullero.”</p>\n<p>There was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it</p>\n<p>between us; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs.</p>",
        "<p>I jumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big silk</p>\n<p>handkerchief under my hat for coolness’ sake and a brace of pistols</p>\n<p>ready primed for safety.</p>\n<p>I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade.</p>\n<p>This was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a</p>\n<p>knoll. Well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they had clapped a</p>\n<p>stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed</p>",
        "<p>for musketry on either side. All round this they had cleared a wide</p>\n<p>space, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high,</p>\n<p>without door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labour</p>\n<p>and too open to shelter the besiegers. The people in the log-house had</p>\n<p>them in every way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like</p>\n<p>partridges. All they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short of a</p>\n<p>complete surprise, they might have held the place against a regiment.</p>",
        "<p>What particularly took my fancy was the spring. For though we had a good</p>\n<p>enough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, with plenty of arms</p>\n<p>and ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been</p>\n<p>one thing overlooked--we had no water. I was thinking this over when</p>\n<p>there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of</p>\n<p>death. I was not new to violent death--I have served his Royal Highness</p>\n<p>the Duke of Cumberland, and got a wound myself at Fontenoy--but I know</p>",
        "<p>my pulse went dot and carry one. “Jim Hawkins is gone,” was my first</p>\n<p>thought.</p>\n<p>It is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been</p>\n<p>a doctor. There is no time to dilly-dally in our work. And so now I made</p>\n<p>up my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and</p>\n<p>jumped on board the jolly-boat.</p>\n<p>By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar. We made the water fly, and the</p>",
        "<p>boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner.</p>\n<p>I found them all shaken, as was natural. The squire was sitting down, as</p>\n<p>white as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!</p>\n<p>And one of the six forecastle hands was little better.</p>\n<p>“There’s a man,” says Captain Smollett, nodding towards him, “new to</p>\n<p>this work. He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry.</p>\n<p>Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us.”</p>",
        "<p>I told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details</p>\n<p>of its accomplishment.</p>\n<p>We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle,</p>\n<p>with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. Hunter</p>\n<p>brought the boat round under the stern-port, and Joyce and I set to work</p>\n<p>loading her with powder tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork, a</p>\n<p>cask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine chest.</p>",
        "<p>In the meantime, the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and the</p>\n<p>latter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man aboard.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Hands,” he said, “here are two of us with a brace of pistols each.</p>\n<p>If any one of you six make a signal of any description, that man’s</p>\n<p>dead.”</p>\n<p>They were a good deal taken aback, and after a little consultation one</p>\n<p>and all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking no doubt to take us</p>",
        "<p>on the rear. But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred</p>\n<p>galley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on</p>\n<p>deck.</p>\n<p>“Down, dog!” cries the captain.</p>\n<p>And the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of</p>\n<p>these six very faint-hearted seamen.</p>\n<p>By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat</p>",
        "<p>loaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern-port,</p>\n<p>and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us.</p>\n<p>This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. “Lillibullero”</p>\n<p>was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the</p>\n<p>little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a</p>\n<p>mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver</p>\n<p>and the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost</p>",
        "<p>by trying for too much.</p>\n<p>We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to</p>\n<p>provision the block house. All three made the first journey, heavily</p>\n<p>laden, and tossed our stores over the palisade. Then, leaving Joyce to</p>\n<p>guard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter</p>\n<p>and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more. So</p>\n<p>we proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was</p>",
        "<p>bestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block</p>\n<p>house, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the HISPANIOLA.</p>\n<p>That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it</p>\n<p>really was. They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the</p>\n<p>advantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before</p>\n<p>they could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves</p>\n<p>we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least.</p>",
        "<p>The squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness</p>\n<p>gone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to</p>\n<p>loading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the</p>\n<p>cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me</p>\n<p>and Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped</p>\n<p>overboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see</p>\n<p>the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy</p>",
        "<p>bottom.</p>\n<p>By this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging</p>\n<p>round to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the</p>\n<p>direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and</p>\n<p>Hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.</p>\n<p>Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the</p>\n<p>boat, which we then brought round to the ship’s counter, to be handier</p>",
        "<p>for Captain Smollett.</p>\n<p>“Now, men,” said he, “do you hear me?”</p>\n<p>There was no answer from the forecastle.</p>\n<p>“It’s to you, Abraham Gray--it’s to you I am speaking.”</p>\n<p>Still no reply.</p>\n<p>“Gray,” resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, “I am leaving this ship,</p>\n<p>and I order you to follow your captain. I know you are a good man at</p>",
        "<p>bottom, and I dare say not one of the lot of you’s as bad as he makes</p>\n<p>out. I have my watch here in my hand; I give you thirty seconds to join</p>\n<p>me in.”</p>\n<p>There was a pause.</p>\n<p>“Come, my fine fellow,” continued the captain; “don’t hang so long in</p>\n<p>stays. I’m risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every</p>\n<p>second.”</p>",
        "<p>There was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst Abraham</p>\n<p>Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came running to the</p>\n<p>captain like a dog to the whistle.</p>\n<p>“I’m with you, sir,” said he.</p>\n<p>And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us, and we</p>\n<p>had shoved off and given way.</p>\n<p>We were clear out of the ship, but not yet ashore in our stockade.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXVII: Narrative Continued by the Doctor: The Jolly-boat’s Last Trip</h3>\n<p>This fifth trip was quite different from any of the others. In the</p>\n<p>first place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely</p>\n<p>overloaded. Five grown men, and three of them--Trelawney, Redruth, and</p>\n<p>the captain--over six feet high, was already more than she was meant</p>\n<p>to carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale was</p>\n<p>lipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches</p>",
        "<p>and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a</p>\n<p>hundred yards.</p>\n<p>The captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more</p>\n<p>evenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.</p>\n<p>In the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong rippling current</p>\n<p>running westward through the basin, and then south’ard and seaward down</p>\n<p>the straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples</p>",
        "<p>were a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we</p>\n<p>were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place</p>\n<p>behind the point. If we let the current have its way we should come</p>\n<p>ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.</p>\n<p>“I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,” said I to the captain.</p>\n<p>I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.</p>\n<p>“The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?”</p>",
        "<p>“Not without swamping the boat,” said he. “You must bear up, sir, if you</p>\n<p>please--bear up until you see you’re gaining.”</p>\n<p>I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward</p>\n<p>until I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the</p>\n<p>way we ought to go.</p>\n<p>“We’ll never get ashore at this rate,” said I.</p>\n<p>“If it’s the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,”</p>",
        "<p>returned the captain. “We must keep upstream. You see, sir,” he went on,</p>\n<p>“if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it’s hard to say</p>\n<p>where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the</p>\n<p>gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can</p>\n<p>dodge back along the shore.”</p>\n<p>“The current’s less a’ready, sir,” said the man Gray, who was sitting in</p>\n<p>the fore-sheets; “you can ease her off a bit.”</p>",
        "<p>“Thank you, my man,” said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we</p>\n<p>had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a</p>\n<p>little changed.</p>\n<p>“The gun!” said he.</p>\n<p>“I have thought of that,” said I, for I made sure he was thinking of a</p>\n<p>bombardment of the fort. “They could never get the gun ashore, and if</p>",
        "<p>they did, they could never haul it through the woods.”</p>\n<p>“Look astern, doctor,” replied the captain.</p>\n<p>We had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were</p>\n<p>the five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called</p>\n<p>the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. Not only that, but</p>\n<p>it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the</p>\n<p>powder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would</p>",
        "<p>put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad.</p>\n<p>“Israel was Flint’s gunner,” said Gray hoarsely.</p>\n<p>At any risk, we put the boat’s head direct for the landing-place. By</p>\n<p>this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept</p>\n<p>steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could</p>\n<p>keep her steady for the goal. But the worst of it was that with the</p>\n<p>course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the</p>",
        "<p>HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door.</p>\n<p>I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands</p>\n<p>plumping down a round-shot on the deck.</p>\n<p>“Who’s the best shot?” asked the captain.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Trelawney, out and away,” said I.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir?</p>\n<p>Hands, if possible,” said the captain.</p>",
        "<p>Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun.</p>\n<p>“Now,” cried the captain, “easy with that gun, sir, or you’ll swamp the</p>\n<p>boat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.”</p>\n<p>The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the</p>\n<p>other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we</p>\n<p>did not ship a drop.</p>\n<p>They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands,</p>",
        "<p>who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most</p>\n<p>exposed. However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he</p>\n<p>stooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four</p>\n<p>who fell.</p>\n<p>The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a</p>\n<p>great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction</p>\n<p>I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling</p>",
        "<p>into their places in the boats.</p>\n<p>“Here come the gigs, sir,” said I.</p>\n<p>“Give way, then,” cried the captain. “We mustn’t mind if we swamp her</p>\n<p>now. If we can’t get ashore, all’s up.”</p>\n<p>“Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir,” I added; “the crew of the</p>\n<p>other most likely going round by shore to cut us off.”</p>\n<p>“They’ll have a hot run, sir,” returned the captain. “Jack ashore, you</p>",
        "<p>know. It’s not them I mind; it’s the round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady’s</p>\n<p>maid couldn’t miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we’ll</p>\n<p>hold water.”</p>\n<p>In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so</p>\n<p>overloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process. We were</p>\n<p>now close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the</p>\n<p>ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering</p>",
        "<p>trees. The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already</p>\n<p>concealed it from our eyes. The ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed</p>\n<p>us, was now making reparation and delaying our assailants. The one</p>\n<p>source of danger was the gun.</p>\n<p>“If I durst,” said the captain, “I’d stop and pick off another man.”</p>\n<p>But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot. They</p>\n<p>had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not</p>",
        "<p>dead, and I could see him trying to crawl away.</p>\n<p>“Ready!” cried the squire.</p>\n<p>“Hold!” cried the captain, quick as an echo.</p>\n<p>And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily</p>\n<p>under water. The report fell in at the same instant of time. This was</p>\n<p>the first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire’s shot not having</p>\n<p>reached him. Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I</p>",
        "<p>fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have</p>\n<p>contributed to our disaster.</p>\n<p>At any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of</p>\n<p>water, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.</p>\n<p>The other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and</p>\n<p>bubbling.</p>\n<p>So far there was no great harm. No lives were lost, and we could wade</p>",
        "<p>ashore in safety. But there were all our stores at the bottom, and to</p>\n<p>make things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for</p>\n<p>service. Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by</p>\n<p>a sort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried his over his</p>\n<p>shoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost. The other</p>\n<p>three had gone down with the boat.</p>\n<p>To add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the</p>",
        "<p>woods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from</p>\n<p>the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether,</p>\n<p>if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the</p>\n<p>sense and conduct to stand firm. Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce</p>\n<p>was a doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush</p>\n<p>one’s clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war.</p>\n<p>With all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving</p>",
        "<p>behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and</p>\n<p>provisions.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XVIII: Narrative Continued by the Doctor: End of the First Day’s Fighting</h3>\n<p>We made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from</p>\n<p>the stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers</p>\n<p>rang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the</p>\n<p>cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.</p>\n<p>I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my</p>\n<p>priming.</p>",
        "<p>“Captain,” said I, “Trelawney is the dead shot. Give him your gun; his</p>\n<p>own is useless.”</p>\n<p>They exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had been since</p>\n<p>the beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that all</p>\n<p>was fit for service. At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I</p>\n<p>handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his</p>\n<p>hand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. It was</p>",
        "<p>plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt.</p>\n<p>Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade</p>\n<p>in front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south</p>\n<p>side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, the</p>\n<p>boatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern</p>\n<p>corner.</p>\n<p>They paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the</p>",
        "<p>squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to</p>\n<p>fire. The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did</p>\n<p>the business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without</p>\n<p>hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.</p>\n<p>After reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to</p>\n<p>the fallen enemy. He was stone dead--shot through the heart.</p>\n<p>We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a</p>",
        "<p>pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor</p>\n<p>Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. Both the squire</p>\n<p>and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable</p>\n<p>we only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor</p>\n<p>Tom.</p>\n<p>The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an</p>\n<p>eye that all was over.</p>",
        "<p>I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers</p>\n<p>once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the</p>\n<p>poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and</p>\n<p>bleeding, into the log-house.</p>\n<p>Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint,</p>\n<p>fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till</p>\n<p>now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like</p>",
        "<p>a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order</p>\n<p>silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score</p>\n<p>of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was</p>\n<p>to die.</p>\n<p>The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand,</p>\n<p>crying like a child.</p>\n<p>“Be I going, doctor?” he asked.</p>",
        "<p>“Tom, my man,” said I, “you’re going home.”</p>\n<p>“I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,” he replied.</p>\n<p>“Tom,” said the squire, “say you forgive me, won’t you?”</p>\n<p>“Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?” was the answer.</p>\n<p>“Howsoever, so be it, amen!”</p>\n<p>After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read</p>\n<p>a prayer. “It’s the custom, sir,” he added apologetically. And not long</p>",
        "<p>after, without another word, he passed away.</p>\n<p>In the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be wonderfully</p>\n<p>swollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various</p>\n<p>stores--the British colours, a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink,</p>\n<p>the log-book, and pounds of tobacco. He had found a longish fir-tree</p>\n<p>lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure, and with the help of Hunter</p>\n<p>he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed</p>",
        "<p>and made an angle. Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand</p>\n<p>bent and run up the colours.</p>\n<p>This seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house and set</p>\n<p>about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed. But he had an</p>\n<p>eye on Tom’s passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came</p>\n<p>forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.</p>\n<p>“Don’t you take on, sir,” he said, shaking the squire’s hand. “All’s</p>",
        "<p>well with him; no fear for a hand that’s been shot down in his duty to</p>\n<p>captain and owner. It mayn’t be good divinity, but it’s a fact.”</p>\n<p>Then he pulled me aside.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Livesey,” he said, “in how many weeks do you and squire expect the</p>\n<p>consort?”</p>\n<p>I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we</p>\n<p>were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but</p>",
        "<p>neither sooner nor later. “You can calculate for yourself,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Why, yes,” returned the captain, scratching his head; “and making a</p>\n<p>large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I should say we</p>\n<p>were pretty close hauled.”</p>\n<p>“How do you mean?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That’s what I mean,”</p>\n<p>replied the captain. “As for powder and shot, we’ll do. But the rations</p>",
        "<p>are short, very short--so short, Dr. Livesey, that we’re perhaps as well</p>\n<p>without that extra mouth.”</p>\n<p>And he pointed to the dead body under the flag.</p>\n<p>Just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high above the</p>\n<p>roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.</p>\n<p>“Oho!” said the captain. “Blaze away! You’ve little enough powder</p>\n<p>already, my lads.”</p>",
        "<p>At the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside</p>\n<p>the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage.</p>\n<p>“Captain,” said the squire, “the house is quite invisible from the ship.</p>\n<p>It must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be wiser to take it</p>\n<p>in?”</p>\n<p>“Strike my colours!” cried the captain. “No, sir, not I”; and as soon</p>\n<p>as he had said the words, I think we all agreed with him. For it was</p>",
        "<p>not only a piece of stout, seamanly, good feeling; it was good policy</p>\n<p>besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.</p>\n<p>All through the evening they kept thundering away. Ball after ball flew</p>\n<p>over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure, but they had</p>\n<p>to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft</p>\n<p>sand. We had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the</p>\n<p>roof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used</p>",
        "<p>to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket.</p>\n<p>“There is one good thing about all this,” observed the captain; “the</p>\n<p>wood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good while; our</p>\n<p>stores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring in pork.”</p>\n<p>Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they stole</p>\n<p>out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were</p>\n<p>bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel’s gunnery. For</p>",
        "<p>four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out</p>\n<p>with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to</p>\n<p>hold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in</p>\n<p>command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some</p>\n<p>secret magazine of their own.</p>\n<p>The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry:</p>\n<p>Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship’s</p>",
        "<p>doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter’s mate; John</p>\n<p>Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce,</p>\n<p>owner’s servants, landsmen--being all that is left</p>\n<p>faithful of the ship’s company--with stores for ten</p>\n<p>days at short rations, came ashore this day and flew</p>\n<p>British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island.</p>\n<p>Thomas Redruth, owner’s servant, landsman, shot by the</p>",
        "<p>mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy--</p>\n<p>And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins’ fate.</p>\n<p>A hail on the land side.</p>\n<p>“Somebody hailing us,” said Hunter, who was on guard.</p>\n<p>“Doctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?” came the cries.</p>\n<p>And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come</p>\n<p>climbing over the stockade.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XIX: Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade</h3>\n<p>As soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the</p>\n<p>arm, and sat down.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said he, “there’s your friends, sure enough.”</p>\n<p>“Far more likely it’s the mutineers,” I answered.</p>\n<p>“That!” he cried. “Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but</p>\n<p>gen’lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don’t make</p>",
        "<p>no doubt of that. No, that’s your friends. There’s been blows too, and I</p>\n<p>reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in</p>\n<p>the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was</p>\n<p>the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were</p>\n<p>never seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on’y Silver--Silver was that</p>\n<p>genteel.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said I, “that may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that</p>",
        "<p>I should hurry on and join my friends.”</p>\n<p>“Nay, mate,” returned Ben, “not you. You’re a good boy, or I’m mistook;</p>\n<p>but you’re on’y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn’t</p>\n<p>bring me there, where you’re going--not rum wouldn’t, till I see your</p>\n<p>born gen’leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won’t forget</p>\n<p>my words; ‘A precious sight (that’s what you’ll say), a precious sight</p>\n<p>more confidence’--and then nips him.”</p>",
        "<p>And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.</p>\n<p>“And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just</p>\n<p>wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing</p>\n<p>in his hand, and he’s to come alone. Oh! And you’ll say this: ‘Ben</p>\n<p>Gunn,’ says you, ‘has reasons of his own.’”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said I, “I believe I understand. You have something to propose,</p>\n<p>and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you’re to be found</p>",
        "<p>where I found you. Is that all?”</p>\n<p>“And when? says you,” he added. “Why, from about noon observation to</p>\n<p>about six bells.”</p>\n<p>“Good,” said I, “and now may I go?”</p>\n<p>“You won’t forget?” he inquired anxiously. “Precious sight, and reasons</p>\n<p>of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that’s the mainstay; as</p>\n<p>between man and man. Well, then”--still holding me--“I reckon you can</p>",
        "<p>go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn’t go for to sell</p>\n<p>Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn’t draw it from you? No, says you. And if</p>\n<p>them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there’d be widders</p>\n<p>in the morning?”</p>\n<p>Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing</p>\n<p>through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where</p>\n<p>we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels</p>",
        "<p>in a different direction.</p>\n<p>For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and</p>\n<p>balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to</p>\n<p>hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying</p>\n<p>missiles. But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst</p>\n<p>not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell</p>\n<p>oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and</p>",
        "<p>after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.</p>\n<p>The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the</p>\n<p>woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was</p>\n<p>far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat</p>\n<p>of the day, chilled me through my jacket.</p>\n<p>The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there</p>\n<p>was the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak.</p>",
        "<p>Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that</p>\n<p>sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the</p>\n<p>air. It was the last of the cannonade.</p>\n<p>I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men</p>\n<p>were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the</p>\n<p>poor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the</p>\n<p>river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point</p>",
        "<p>and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I</p>\n<p>had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a</p>\n<p>sound in their voices which suggested rum.</p>\n<p>At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty</p>\n<p>far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east,</p>\n<p>and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my</p>\n<p>feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among</p>",
        "<p>low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in</p>\n<p>colour. It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben</p>\n<p>Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I</p>\n<p>should know where to look for one.</p>\n<p>Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or</p>\n<p>shoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by the</p>\n<p>faithful party.</p>",
        "<p>I had soon told my story and began to look about me. The log-house was</p>\n<p>made of unsquared trunks of pine--roof, walls, and floor. The latter</p>\n<p>stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the</p>\n<p>surface of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under this porch</p>\n<p>the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd</p>\n<p>kind--no other than a great ship’s kettle of iron, with the bottom</p>\n<p>knocked out, and sunk “to her bearings,” as the captain said, among the</p>",
        "<p>sand.</p>\n<p>Little had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one</p>\n<p>corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old</p>\n<p>rusty iron basket to contain the fire.</p>\n<p>The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been</p>\n<p>cleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps</p>\n<p>what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the soil had</p>",
        "<p>been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only</p>\n<p>where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and</p>\n<p>some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand.</p>\n<p>Very close around the stockade--too close for defence, they said--the</p>\n<p>wood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but</p>\n<p>towards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks.</p>\n<p>The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every</p>",
        "<p>chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain</p>\n<p>of fine sand. There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our</p>\n<p>suppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all</p>\n<p>the world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole</p>\n<p>in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way</p>\n<p>out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping</p>\n<p>the eye.</p>",
        "<p>Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage</p>\n<p>for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor</p>\n<p>old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark,</p>\n<p>under the Union Jack.</p>\n<p>If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the</p>\n<p>blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were</p>\n<p>called up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor and</p>",
        "<p>Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired</p>\n<p>though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to</p>\n<p>dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at</p>\n<p>the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up</p>\n<p>our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.</p>\n<p>From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to</p>\n<p>rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he</p>",
        "<p>did so, he had a word for me.</p>\n<p>“That man Smollett,” he said once, “is a better man than I am. And when</p>\n<p>I say that it means a deal, Jim.”</p>\n<p>Another time he came and was silent for a while. Then he put his head on</p>\n<p>one side, and looked at me.</p>\n<p>“Is this Ben Gunn a man?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I do not know, sir,” said I. “I am not very sure whether he’s sane.”</p>",
        "<p>“If there’s any doubt about the matter, he is,” returned the doctor. “A</p>\n<p>man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, Jim,</p>\n<p>can’t expect to appear as sane as you or me. It doesn’t lie in human</p>\n<p>nature. Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir, cheese,” I answered.</p>\n<p>“Well, Jim,” says he, “just see the good that comes of being dainty in</p>\n<p>your food. You’ve seen my snuff-box, haven’t you? And you never saw me</p>",
        "<p>take snuff, the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of</p>\n<p>Parmesan cheese--a cheese made in Italy, very nutritious. Well, that’s</p>\n<p>for Ben Gunn!”</p>\n<p>Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round</p>\n<p>him for a while bare-headed in the breeze. A good deal of firewood had</p>\n<p>been got in, but not enough for the captain’s fancy, and he shook his</p>\n<p>head over it and told us we “must get back to this tomorrow rather</p>",
        "<p>livelier.” Then, when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff</p>\n<p>glass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to</p>\n<p>discuss our prospects.</p>\n<p>It appears they were at their wits’ end what to do, the stores being so</p>\n<p>low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came.</p>\n<p>But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until</p>\n<p>they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA. From</p>",
        "<p>nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded,</p>\n<p>and one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he</p>\n<p>were not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it,</p>\n<p>saving our own lives, with the extremest care. And besides that, we had</p>\n<p>two able allies--rum and the climate.</p>\n<p>As for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear</p>\n<p>them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second,</p>",
        "<p>the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh</p>\n<p>and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs</p>\n<p>before a week.</p>\n<p>“So,” he added, “if we are not all shot down first they’ll be glad to</p>\n<p>be packing in the schooner. It’s always a ship, and they can get to</p>\n<p>buccaneering again, I suppose.”</p>\n<p>“First ship that ever I lost,” said Captain Smollett.</p>",
        "<p>I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep, which was</p>\n<p>not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood.</p>\n<p>The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the</p>\n<p>pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a</p>\n<p>bustle and the sound of voices.</p>\n<p>“Flag of truce!” I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with</p>\n<p>a cry of surprise, “Silver himself!”</p>",
        "<p>And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the</p>\n<p>wall.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XX: Silver’s Embassy</h3>\n<p>Sure enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them</p>\n<p>waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself,</p>\n<p>standing placidly by.</p>\n<p>It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever</p>\n<p>was abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright</p>\n<p>and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in</p>",
        "<p>the sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in</p>\n<p>shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled</p>\n<p>during the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken</p>\n<p>together told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp,</p>\n<p>feverish, unhealthy spot.</p>\n<p>“Keep indoors, men,” said the captain. “Ten to one this is a trick.”</p>\n<p>Then he hailed the buccaneer.</p>",
        "<p>“Who goes? Stand, or we fire.”</p>\n<p>“Flag of truce,” cried Silver.</p>\n<p>The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way</p>\n<p>of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to</p>\n<p>us, “Doctor’s watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side,</p>\n<p>if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to</p>\n<p>load muskets. Lively, men, and careful.”</p>",
        "<p>And then he turned again to the mutineers.</p>\n<p>“And what do you want with your flag of truce?” he cried.</p>\n<p>This time it was the other man who replied.</p>\n<p>“Cap’n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,” he shouted.</p>\n<p>“Cap’n Silver! Don’t know him. Who’s he?” cried the captain. And we</p>\n<p>could hear him adding to himself, “Cap’n, is it? My heart, and here’s</p>\n<p>promotion!”</p>",
        "<p>Long John answered for himself. “Me, sir. These poor lads have chosen me</p>\n<p>cap’n, after your desertion, sir”--laying a particular emphasis upon the</p>\n<p>word “desertion.” “We’re willing to submit, if we can come to terms,</p>\n<p>and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap’n Smollett, to let me</p>\n<p>safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o’</p>\n<p>shot before a gun is fired.”</p>\n<p>“My man,” said Captain Smollett, “I have not the slightest desire to</p>",
        "<p>talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that’s all. If</p>\n<p>there’s any treachery, it’ll be on your side, and the Lord help you.”</p>\n<p>“That’s enough, Cap’n,” shouted Long John cheerily. “A word from you’s</p>\n<p>enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.”</p>\n<p>We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold</p>\n<p>Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the</p>\n<p>captain’s answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the</p>",
        "<p>back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the</p>\n<p>stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour</p>\n<p>and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the</p>\n<p>other side.</p>\n<p>I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on</p>\n<p>to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted</p>\n<p>my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated</p>",
        "<p>himself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his</p>\n<p>hands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron</p>\n<p>kettle in the sand. He was whistling “Come, Lasses and Lads.”</p>\n<p>Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. What with the</p>\n<p>steepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he</p>\n<p>and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. But he stuck to it</p>\n<p>like a man in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom</p>",
        "<p>he saluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked out in his best;</p>\n<p>an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his</p>\n<p>knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.</p>\n<p>“Here you are, my man,” said the captain, raising his head. “You had</p>\n<p>better sit down.”</p>\n<p>“You ain’t a-going to let me inside, Cap’n?” complained Long John. “It’s</p>\n<p>a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.”</p>",
        "<p>“Why, Silver,” said the captain, “if you had pleased to be an honest</p>\n<p>man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It’s your own doing.</p>\n<p>You’re either my ship’s cook--and then you were treated handsome--or</p>\n<p>Cap’n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!”</p>\n<p>“Well, well, Cap’n,” returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was</p>\n<p>bidden on the sand, “you’ll have to give me a hand up again, that’s all.</p>\n<p>A sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there’s Jim! The top of</p>",
        "<p>the morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here’s my service. Why, there you all</p>\n<p>are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.”</p>\n<p>“If you have anything to say, my man, better say it,” said the captain.</p>\n<p>“Right you were, Cap’n Smollett,” replied Silver. “Dooty is dooty, to be</p>\n<p>sure. Well now, you look here, that was a good lay of yours last</p>\n<p>night. I don’t deny it was a good lay. Some of you pretty handy with a</p>\n<p>handspike-end. And I’ll not deny neither but what some of my people was</p>",
        "<p>shook--maybe all was shook; maybe I was shook myself; maybe that’s</p>\n<p>why I’m here for terms. But you mark me, Cap’n, it won’t do twice, by</p>\n<p>thunder! We’ll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the</p>\n<p>rum. Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind’s eye. But I’ll</p>\n<p>tell you I was sober; I was on’y dog tired; and if I’d awoke a second</p>\n<p>sooner, I’d ’a caught you at the act, I would. He wasn’t dead when I got</p>\n<p>round to him, not he.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well?” says Captain Smollett as cool as can be.</p>\n<p>All that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have</p>\n<p>guessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to have an inkling. Ben</p>\n<p>Gunn’s last words came back to my mind. I began to suppose that he had</p>\n<p>paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round</p>\n<p>their fire, and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen</p>\n<p>enemies to deal with.</p>",
        "<p>“Well, here it is,” said Silver. “We want that treasure, and we’ll have</p>\n<p>it--that’s our point! You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon;</p>\n<p>and that’s yours. You have a chart, haven’t you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s as may be,” replied the captain.</p>\n<p>“Oh, well, you have, I know that,” returned Long John. “You needn’t be</p>\n<p>so husky with a man; there ain’t a particle of service in that, and you</p>\n<p>may lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart. Now, I never meant</p>",
        "<p>you no harm, myself.”</p>\n<p>“That won’t do with me, my man,” interrupted the captain. “We know</p>\n<p>exactly what you meant to do, and we don’t care, for now, you see, you</p>\n<p>can’t do it.”</p>\n<p>And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe.</p>\n<p>“If Abe Gray--” Silver broke out.</p>\n<p>“Avast there!” cried Mr. Smollett. “Gray told me nothing, and I asked</p>",
        "<p>him nothing; and what’s more, I would see you and him and this whole</p>\n<p>island blown clean out of the water into blazes first. So there’s my</p>\n<p>mind for you, my man, on that.”</p>\n<p>This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down. He had been</p>\n<p>growing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together.</p>\n<p>“Like enough,” said he. “I would set no limits to what gentlemen might</p>\n<p>consider shipshape, or might not, as the case were. And seein’ as how</p>",
        "<p>you are about to take a pipe, Cap’n, I’ll make so free as do likewise.”</p>\n<p>And he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently</p>\n<p>smoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now</p>\n<p>stopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. It was as good as</p>\n<p>the play to see them.</p>\n<p>“Now,” resumed Silver, “here it is. You give us the chart to get the</p>\n<p>treasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in</p>",
        "<p>while asleep. You do that, and we’ll offer you a choice. Either you come</p>\n<p>aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I’ll give you my</p>\n<p>affy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you somewhere safe ashore. Or</p>\n<p>if that ain’t to your fancy, some of my hands being rough and having</p>\n<p>old scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. We’ll</p>\n<p>divide stores with you, man for man; and I’ll give my affy-davy, as</p>\n<p>before to speak the first ship I sight, and send ’em here to pick you</p>",
        "<p>up. Now, you’ll own that’s talking. Handsomer you couldn’t look to get,</p>\n<p>now you. And I hope”--raising his voice--“that all hands in this here</p>\n<p>block house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to</p>\n<p>all.”</p>\n<p>Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his</p>\n<p>pipe in the palm of his left hand.</p>\n<p>“Is that all?” he asked.</p>",
        "<p>“Every last word, by thunder!” answered John. “Refuse that, and you’ve</p>\n<p>seen the last of me but musket-balls.”</p>\n<p>“Very good,” said the captain. “Now you’ll hear me. If you’ll come up</p>\n<p>one by one, unarmed, I’ll engage to clap you all in irons and take you</p>\n<p>home to a fair trial in England. If you won’t, my name is Alexander</p>\n<p>Smollett, I’ve flown my sovereign’s colours, and I’ll see you all</p>\n<p>to Davy Jones. You can’t find the treasure. You can’t sail the</p>",
        "<p>ship--there’s not a man among you fit to sail the ship. You can’t fight</p>\n<p>us--Gray, there, got away from five of you. Your ship’s in irons, Master</p>\n<p>Silver; you’re on a lee shore, and so you’ll find. I stand here and tell</p>\n<p>you so; and they’re the last good words you’ll get from me, for in the</p>\n<p>name of heaven, I’ll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you.</p>\n<p>Tramp, my lad. Bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double</p>\n<p>quick.”</p>",
        "<p>Silver’s face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. He</p>\n<p>shook the fire out of his pipe.</p>\n<p>“Give me a hand up!” he cried.</p>\n<p>“Not I,” returned the captain.</p>\n<p>“Who’ll give me a hand up?” he roared.</p>\n<p>Not a man among us moved. Growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled</p>\n<p>along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself</p>",
        "<p>again upon his crutch. Then he spat into the spring.</p>\n<p>“There!” he cried. “That’s what I think of ye. Before an hour’s out,</p>\n<p>I’ll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon. Laugh, by</p>\n<p>thunder, laugh! Before an hour’s out, ye’ll laugh upon the other side.</p>\n<p>Them that die’ll be the lucky ones.”</p>\n<p>And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the sand, was</p>\n<p>helped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with</p>",
        "<p>the flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the</p>\n<p>trees.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXI: The Attack</h3>\n<p>As soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely</p>\n<p>watching him, turned towards the interior of the house and found not a</p>\n<p>man of us at his post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen</p>\n<p>him angry.</p>\n<p>“Quarters!” he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our places,</p>\n<p>“Gray,” he said, “I’ll put your name in the log; you’ve stood by your</p>",
        "<p>duty like a seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I’m surprised at you, sir. Doctor,</p>\n<p>I thought you had worn the king’s coat! If that was how you served at</p>\n<p>Fontenoy, sir, you’d have been better in your berth.”</p>\n<p>The doctor’s watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy</p>\n<p>loading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be</p>\n<p>certain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.</p>\n<p>The captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke.</p>",
        "<p>“My lads,” said he, “I’ve given Silver a broadside. I pitched it in</p>\n<p>red-hot on purpose; and before the hour’s out, as he said, we shall be</p>\n<p>boarded. We’re outnumbered, I needn’t tell you that, but we fight in</p>\n<p>shelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline.</p>\n<p>I’ve no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you choose.”</p>\n<p>Then he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was clear.</p>\n<p>On the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two</p>",
        "<p>loopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the</p>\n<p>north side, five. There was a round score of muskets for the seven</p>\n<p>of us; the firewood had been built into four piles--tables, you might</p>\n<p>say--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some</p>\n<p>ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the</p>\n<p>defenders. In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.</p>\n<p>“Toss out the fire,” said the captain; “the chill is past, and we</p>",
        "<p>mustn’t have smoke in our eyes.”</p>\n<p>The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the</p>\n<p>embers smothered among sand.</p>\n<p>“Hawkins hasn’t had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and back to</p>\n<p>your post to eat it,” continued Captain Smollett. “Lively, now, my lad;</p>\n<p>you’ll want it before you’ve done. Hunter, serve out a round of brandy</p>\n<p>to all hands.”</p>",
        "<p>And while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the</p>\n<p>plan of the defence.</p>\n<p>“Doctor, you will take the door,” he resumed. “See, and don’t expose</p>\n<p>yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east</p>\n<p>side, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you</p>\n<p>are the best shot--you and Gray will take this long north side, with the</p>\n<p>five loopholes; it’s there the danger is. If they can get up to it and</p>",
        "<p>fire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty.</p>\n<p>Hawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we’ll stand</p>\n<p>by to load and bear a hand.”</p>\n<p>As the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had</p>\n<p>climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the</p>\n<p>clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sand was baking</p>\n<p>and the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats</p>",
        "<p>were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the</p>\n<p>shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and</p>\n<p>anxiety.</p>\n<p>An hour passed away.</p>\n<p>“Hang them!” said the captain. “This is as dull as the doldrums. Gray,</p>\n<p>whistle for a wind.”</p>\n<p>And just at that moment came the first news of the attack.</p>",
        "<p>“If you please, sir,” said Joyce, “if I see anyone, am I to fire?”</p>\n<p>“I told you so!” cried the captain.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, sir,” returned Joyce with the same quiet civility.</p>\n<p>Nothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert,</p>\n<p>straining ears and eyes--the musketeers with their pieces balanced in</p>\n<p>their hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his</p>\n<p>mouth very tight and a frown on his face.</p>",
        "<p>So some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket</p>\n<p>and fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and</p>\n<p>repeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like</p>\n<p>a string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets</p>\n<p>struck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away</p>\n<p>and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and</p>\n<p>empty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel</p>",
        "<p>betrayed the presence of our foes.</p>\n<p>“Did you hit your man?” asked the captain.</p>\n<p>“No, sir,” replied Joyce. “I believe not, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Next best thing to tell the truth,” muttered Captain Smollett. “Load</p>\n<p>his gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?”</p>\n<p>“I know precisely,” said Dr. Livesey. “Three shots were fired on this</p>\n<p>side. I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the</p>",
        "<p>west.”</p>\n<p>“Three!” repeated the captain. “And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?”</p>\n<p>But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the</p>\n<p>north--seven by the squire’s computation, eight or nine according to</p>\n<p>Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was</p>\n<p>plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and</p>\n<p>that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of</p>",
        "<p>hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If</p>\n<p>the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would</p>\n<p>take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats</p>\n<p>in our own stronghold.</p>\n<p>Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud</p>\n<p>huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side</p>\n<p>and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once</p>",
        "<p>more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway</p>\n<p>and knocked the doctor’s musket into bits.</p>\n<p>The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired</p>\n<p>again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure,</p>\n<p>two back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened</p>\n<p>than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly</p>\n<p>disappeared among the trees.</p>",
        "<p>Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing</p>\n<p>inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight</p>\n<p>men, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though</p>\n<p>useless fire on the log-house.</p>\n<p>The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building,</p>\n<p>shouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to</p>\n<p>encourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the</p>",
        "<p>marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In a moment, the</p>\n<p>four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us.</p>\n<p>The head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle</p>\n<p>loophole.</p>\n<p>“At ’em, all hands--all hands!” he roared in a voice of thunder.</p>\n<p>At the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter’s musket by the</p>\n<p>muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole,</p>",
        "<p>and with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared</p>\n<p>suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.</p>\n<p>Our position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were firing, under</p>\n<p>cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could</p>\n<p>not return a blow.</p>\n<p>The log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative</p>",
        "<p>safety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol-shots,</p>\n<p>and one loud groan rang in my ears.</p>\n<p>“Out, lads, out, and fight ’em in the open! Cutlasses!” cried the</p>\n<p>captain.</p>\n<p>I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time</p>\n<p>snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly</p>\n<p>felt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight. Someone was</p>",
        "<p>close behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the doctor was pursuing</p>\n<p>his assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat</p>\n<p>down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash</p>\n<p>across the face.</p>\n<p>“Round the house, lads! Round the house!” cried the captain; and even in</p>\n<p>the hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised,</p>",
        "<p>ran round the corner of the house. Next moment I was face to face</p>\n<p>with Anderson. He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head,</p>\n<p>flashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow</p>\n<p>still hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my</p>\n<p>foot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope.</p>\n<p>When I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been</p>\n<p>already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One man, in a red</p>",
        "<p>night-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and</p>\n<p>thrown a leg across. Well, so short had been the interval that when I</p>\n<p>found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red</p>\n<p>night-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above</p>\n<p>the top of the stockade. And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was</p>\n<p>over and the victory was ours.</p>\n<p>Gray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere</p>",
        "<p>he had time to recover from his last blow. Another had been shot at a</p>\n<p>loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony,</p>\n<p>the pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor</p>\n<p>had disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had scaled the palisade, one</p>\n<p>only remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the</p>\n<p>field, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him.</p>\n<p>“Fire--fire from the house!” cried the doctor. “And you, lads, back into</p>",
        "<p>cover.”</p>\n<p>But his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and the last boarder</p>\n<p>made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood. In</p>\n<p>three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who</p>\n<p>had fallen, four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade.</p>\n<p>The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter. The survivors</p>\n<p>would soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment</p>",
        "<p>the fire might recommence.</p>\n<p>The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at</p>\n<p>a glance the price we had paid for victory. Hunter lay beside his</p>\n<p>loophole, stunned; Joyce by his, shot through the head, never to move</p>\n<p>again; while right in the centre, the squire was supporting the captain,</p>\n<p>one as pale as the other.</p>\n<p>“The captain’s wounded,” said Mr. Trelawney.</p>",
        "<p>“Have they run?” asked Mr. Smollett.</p>\n<p>“All that could, you may be bound,” returned the doctor; “but there’s</p>\n<p>five of them will never run again.”</p>\n<p>“Five!” cried the captain. “Come, that’s better. Five against three</p>\n<p>leaves us four to nine. That’s better odds than we had at starting. We</p>\n<p>were seven to nineteen then, or thought we were, and that’s as bad to</p>\n<p>bear.” *</p>",
        "<p>*The mutineers were soon only eight in number, for the man shot by Mr.</p>\n<p>Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound. But</p>\n<p>this was, of course, not known till after by the faithful party.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter XXII: How I Began My Sea Adventure</h3>\n<p>There was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of</p>\n<p>the woods. They had “got their rations for that day,” as the captain put</p>\n<p>it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the</p>\n<p>wounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the</p>\n<p>danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for</p>\n<p>horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor’s patients.</p>",
        "<p>Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still</p>\n<p>breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole,</p>\n<p>Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good</p>\n<p>as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor’s knife, and Hunter,</p>\n<p>do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He</p>\n<p>lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his</p>\n<p>apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the</p>",
        "<p>blow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following</p>\n<p>night, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.</p>\n<p>As for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not dangerous.</p>\n<p>No organ was fatally injured. Anderson’s ball--for it was Job that</p>\n<p>shot him first--had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not</p>\n<p>badly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf.</p>\n<p>He was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for</p>",
        "<p>weeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak</p>\n<p>when he could help it.</p>\n<p>My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite. Doctor</p>\n<p>Livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the</p>\n<p>bargain.</p>\n<p>After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain’s side awhile</p>\n<p>in consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts’ content, it</p>",
        "<p>being then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols,</p>\n<p>girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over</p>\n<p>his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly</p>\n<p>through the trees.</p>\n<p>Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to</p>\n<p>be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray took his pipe out</p>\n<p>of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck</p>",
        "<p>he was at this occurrence.</p>\n<p>“Why, in the name of Davy Jones,” said he, “is Dr. Livesey mad?”</p>\n<p>“Why no,” says I. “He’s about the last of this crew for that, I take</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“Well, shipmate,” said Gray, “mad he may not be; but if HE’S not, you</p>\n<p>mark my words, I am.”</p>\n<p>“I take it,” replied I, “the doctor has his idea; and if I am right,</p>",
        "<p>he’s going now to see Ben Gunn.”</p>\n<p>I was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being</p>\n<p>stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze</p>\n<p>with midday sun, I began to get another thought into my head, which was</p>\n<p>not by any means so right. What I began to do was to envy the doctor</p>\n<p>walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the</p>\n<p>pleasant smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, with my clothes</p>",
        "<p>stuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor</p>\n<p>dead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was</p>\n<p>almost as strong as fear.</p>\n<p>All the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing up</p>\n<p>the things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger</p>\n<p>and stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then</p>\n<p>observing me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both</p>",
        "<p>pockets of my coat with biscuit.</p>\n<p>I was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish,</p>\n<p>over-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in</p>\n<p>my power. These biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at</p>\n<p>least, from starving till far on in the next day.</p>\n<p>The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I already</p>\n<p>had a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied with arms.</p>",
        "<p>As for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. I</p>\n<p>was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east</p>\n<p>from the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and</p>\n<p>ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat,</p>\n<p>a thing quite worth doing, as I still believe. But as I was certain I</p>\n<p>should not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take</p>\n<p>French leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad</p>",
        "<p>a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong. But I was only a boy,</p>\n<p>and I had made my mind up.</p>\n<p>Well, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable opportunity. The</p>\n<p>squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the</p>\n<p>coast was clear, I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the</p>\n<p>thickest of the trees, and before my absence was observed I was out of</p>\n<p>cry of my companions.</p>",
        "<p>This was my second folly, far worse than the first, as I left but two</p>\n<p>sound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a help towards</p>\n<p>saving all of us.</p>\n<p>I took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was</p>\n<p>determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of</p>\n<p>observation from the anchorage. It was already late in the afternoon,</p>\n<p>although still warm and sunny. As I continued to thread the tall woods,</p>",
        "<p>I could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the</p>\n<p>surf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which</p>\n<p>showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual. Soon cool</p>\n<p>draughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth</p>\n<p>into the open borders of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny</p>\n<p>to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the</p>\n<p>beach.</p>",
        "<p>I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island. The sun might</p>\n<p>blaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface smooth and</p>\n<p>blue, but still these great rollers would be running along all the</p>\n<p>external coast, thundering and thundering by day and night; and I scarce</p>\n<p>believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of</p>\n<p>earshot of their noise.</p>\n<p>I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking</p>",
        "<p>I was now got far enough to the south, I took the cover of some thick</p>\n<p>bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit.</p>\n<p>Behind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. The sea breeze, as though</p>\n<p>it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence, was already</p>\n<p>at an end; it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south</p>\n<p>and south-east, carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under</p>\n<p>lee of Skeleton Island, lay still and leaden as when first we entered</p>",
        "<p>it. The HISPANIOLA, in that unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from</p>\n<p>the truck to the waterline, the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak.</p>\n<p>Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets--him I could</p>\n<p>always recognize--while a couple of men were leaning over the stern</p>\n<p>bulwarks, one of them with a red cap--the very rogue that I had seen</p>\n<p>some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade. Apparently they were</p>\n<p>talking and laughing, though at that distance--upwards of a mile--I</p>",
        "<p>could, of course, hear no word of what was said. All at once there began</p>\n<p>the most horrid, unearthly screaming, which at first startled me badly,</p>\n<p>though I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought</p>\n<p>I could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon</p>\n<p>her master’s wrist.</p>\n<p>Soon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man</p>\n<p>with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion.</p>",
        "<p>Just about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass,</p>\n<p>and as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest.</p>\n<p>I saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening.</p>\n<p>The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of</p>\n<p>a mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up</p>\n<p>with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. Night had almost</p>\n<p>come when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was</p>",
        "<p>an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick</p>\n<p>underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the</p>\n<p>centre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what</p>\n<p>the gipsies carry about with them in England.</p>\n<p>I dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was</p>\n<p>Ben Gunn’s boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude,</p>\n<p>lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of</p>",
        "<p>goat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even</p>\n<p>for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a</p>\n<p>full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of</p>\n<p>stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion.</p>\n<p>I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but</p>\n<p>I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn’s</p>\n<p>boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever</p>",
        "<p>made by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly</p>\n<p>possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.</p>\n<p>Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had</p>\n<p>enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another</p>\n<p>notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried</p>\n<p>it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was</p>\n<p>to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let</p>",
        "<p>her go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the</p>\n<p>mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their</p>\n<p>hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be</p>\n<p>a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their</p>\n<p>watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little</p>\n<p>risk.</p>\n<p>Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It</p>",
        "<p>was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried</p>\n<p>all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared,</p>\n<p>absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last,</p>\n<p>I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow</p>\n<p>where I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole</p>\n<p>anchorage.</p>\n<p>One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay</p>",
        "<p>carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the</p>\n<p>darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship. She had swung</p>\n<p>round to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board</p>\n<p>were in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of</p>\n<p>the strong rays that flowed from the stern window.</p>\n<p>The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt</p>\n<p>of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I</p>",
        "<p>came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in,</p>\n<p>with some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the</p>\n<p>surface.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXIII: The Ebb-tide Runs</h3>\n<p>The coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with</p>\n<p>her--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both</p>\n<p>buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,</p>\n<p>lop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more</p>\n<p>leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre</p>\n<p>she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was “queer</p>",
        "<p>to handle till you knew her way.”</p>\n<p>Certainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the</p>\n<p>one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,</p>\n<p>and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the</p>\n<p>tide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping</p>\n<p>me down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be</p>\n<p>missed.</p>",
        "<p>First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than</p>\n<p>darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next</p>\n<p>moment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the</p>\n<p>current of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.</p>\n<p>The hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she</p>\n<p>pulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, the</p>\n<p>rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream.</p>",
        "<p>One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the</p>\n<p>tide.</p>\n<p>So far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut</p>\n<p>hawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten to</p>\n<p>one, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, I</p>\n<p>and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water.</p>\n<p>This brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again</p>",
        "<p>particularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design. But</p>\n<p>the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south</p>\n<p>had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I was</p>\n<p>meditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up into</p>\n<p>the current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp,</p>\n<p>and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water.</p>\n<p>With that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth,</p>",
        "<p>and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.</p>\n<p>Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be</p>\n<p>once more lightened by a breath of wind.</p>\n<p>All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but</p>\n<p>to say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts</p>\n<p>that I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to</p>\n<p>do, I began to pay more heed.</p>",
        "<p>One I recognized for the coxswain’s, Israel Hands, that had been Flint’s</p>\n<p>gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red</p>\n<p>night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still</p>\n<p>drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken</p>\n<p>cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to</p>\n<p>be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they</p>\n<p>were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and</p>",
        "<p>then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end</p>\n<p>in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled</p>\n<p>lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed</p>\n<p>away without result.</p>\n<p>On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly</p>\n<p>through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning</p>\n<p>sailor’s song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse,</p>",
        "<p>and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had</p>\n<p>heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:</p>\n<p>“But one man of her crew alive,</p>\n<p>What put to sea with seventy-five.”</p>\n<p>And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a</p>\n<p>company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from</p>\n<p>what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed</p>",
        "<p>on.</p>\n<p>At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the</p>\n<p>dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough</p>\n<p>effort, cut the last fibres through.</p>\n<p>The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost</p>\n<p>instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time,</p>\n<p>the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end,</p>",
        "<p>across the current.</p>\n<p>I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and</p>\n<p>since I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved</p>\n<p>straight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and</p>\n<p>just as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord</p>\n<p>that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I</p>\n<p>grasped it.</p>",
        "<p>Why I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere</p>\n<p>instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity</p>\n<p>began to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look</p>\n<p>through the cabin window.</p>\n<p>I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near</p>\n<p>enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded</p>\n<p>the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.</p>",
        "<p>By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty</p>\n<p>swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with</p>\n<p>the camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading</p>\n<p>the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I</p>\n<p>got my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen</p>\n<p>had taken no alarm. One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was</p>\n<p>only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me</p>",
        "<p>Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a</p>\n<p>hand upon the other’s throat.</p>\n<p>I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near</p>\n<p>overboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious,</p>\n<p>encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my</p>\n<p>eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness.</p>\n<p>The endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished</p>",
        "<p>company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so</p>\n<p>often:</p>\n<p>“Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--</p>\n<p>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!</p>\n<p>Drink and the devil had done for the rest--</p>\n<p>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”</p>\n<p>I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very</p>",
        "<p>moment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when I was surprised by a sudden</p>\n<p>lurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed</p>\n<p>to change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased.</p>\n<p>I opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combing</p>\n<p>over with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. The</p>\n<p>HISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled</p>\n<p>along, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a</p>",
        "<p>little against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I</p>\n<p>made sure she also was wheeling to the southward.</p>\n<p>I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. There,</p>\n<p>right behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current had turned</p>\n<p>at right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and</p>\n<p>the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever</p>\n<p>muttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.</p>",
        "<p>Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning,</p>\n<p>perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one</p>\n<p>shout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding on</p>\n<p>the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been</p>\n<p>interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.</p>\n<p>I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly</p>\n<p>recommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the straits, I</p>",
        "<p>made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all my</p>\n<p>troubles would be ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear to</p>\n<p>die, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.</p>\n<p>So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the</p>\n<p>billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to</p>\n<p>expect death at the next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; a</p>\n<p>numbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst of</p>",
        "<p>my terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle</p>\n<p>I lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXIV: The Cruise of the Coracle</h3>\n<p>It was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west</p>\n<p>end of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid from me behind</p>\n<p>the great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to</p>\n<p>the sea in formidable cliffs.</p>\n<p>Haulbowline Head and Mizzenmast Hill were at my elbow, the hill bare</p>\n<p>and dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and</p>",
        "<p>fringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of a</p>\n<p>mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.</p>\n<p>That notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakers</p>\n<p>spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and</p>\n<p>falling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself,</p>\n<p>if I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending</p>\n<p>my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.</p>",
        "<p>Nor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or</p>\n<p>letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge</p>\n<p>slimy monsters--soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness--two</p>\n<p>or three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their</p>\n<p>barkings.</p>\n<p>I have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.</p>\n<p>But the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the</p>",
        "<p>high running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of that</p>\n<p>landing-place. I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront</p>\n<p>such perils.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me. North</p>\n<p>of Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tide</p>\n<p>a long stretch of yellow sand. To the north of that, again, there comes</p>\n<p>another cape--Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart--buried</p>",
        "<p>in tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.</p>\n<p>I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward</p>\n<p>along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my</p>\n<p>position that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave</p>\n<p>Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to</p>\n<p>land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.</p>\n<p>There was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing steady</p>",
        "<p>and gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the</p>\n<p>current, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.</p>\n<p>Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was,</p>\n<p>it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could</p>\n<p>ride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye</p>\n<p>above the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;</p>\n<p>yet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and</p>",
        "<p>subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.</p>\n<p>I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at</p>\n<p>paddling. But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will</p>\n<p>produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardly</p>\n<p>moved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement,</p>\n<p>ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and</p>\n<p>struck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next</p>",
        "<p>wave.</p>\n<p>I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old</p>\n<p>position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led</p>\n<p>me as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be</p>\n<p>interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her</p>\n<p>course, what hope had I left of reaching land?</p>\n<p>I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that.</p>",
        "<p>First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my</p>\n<p>sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself</p>\n<p>to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.</p>\n<p>I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks</p>\n<p>from shore or from a vessel’s deck, was for all the world like any range</p>\n<p>of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The</p>\n<p>coracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to</p>",
        "<p>speak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes</p>\n<p>and higher, toppling summits of the wave.</p>\n<p>“Well, now,” thought I to myself, “it is plain I must lie where I am and</p>\n<p>not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle</p>\n<p>over the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove</p>\n<p>or two towards land.” No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on</p>\n<p>my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a</p>",
        "<p>weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.</p>\n<p>It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as</p>\n<p>we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly</p>\n<p>miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was,</p>\n<p>indeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together</p>\n<p>in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without</p>\n<p>fail.</p>",
        "<p>It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow</p>\n<p>of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the</p>\n<p>sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt,</p>\n<p>combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the</p>\n<p>trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the</p>\n<p>current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea</p>\n<p>opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.</p>",
        "<p>Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA</p>\n<p>under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was</p>\n<p>so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad</p>\n<p>or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion,</p>\n<p>surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing</p>\n<p>but stare and wonder.</p>\n<p>The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful</p>",
        "<p>white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first</p>\n<p>sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about</p>\n<p>north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island</p>\n<p>on their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more</p>\n<p>and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were</p>\n<p>going about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind’s</p>\n<p>eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her</p>",
        "<p>sails shivering.</p>\n<p>“Clumsy fellows,” said I; “they must still be drunk as owls.” And I</p>\n<p>thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another</p>\n<p>tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead</p>\n<p>in the wind’s eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and</p>\n<p>down, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops</p>",
        "<p>and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly</p>\n<p>flapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if</p>\n<p>so, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her,</p>\n<p>I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel</p>\n<p>to her captain.</p>\n<p>The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate.</p>\n<p>As for the latter’s sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she</p>",
        "<p>hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if</p>\n<p>she did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made</p>\n<p>sure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventure</p>\n<p>that inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore</p>\n<p>companion doubled my growing courage.</p>\n<p>Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but</p>\n<p>this time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and</p>",
        "<p>caution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a sea</p>\n<p>so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like</p>\n<p>a bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my</p>\n<p>coracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and</p>\n<p>a dash of foam in my face.</p>\n<p>I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass glisten</p>\n<p>on the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon her</p>",
        "<p>decks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men</p>\n<p>were lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and do</p>\n<p>what I chose with the ship.</p>\n<p>For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for</p>\n<p>me--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all</p>\n<p>the time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these</p>\n<p>brought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said this was</p>",
        "<p>the worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in this</p>\n<p>situation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling</p>\n<p>and banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, not</p>\n<p>only with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her</p>\n<p>leeway, which was naturally great.</p>\n<p>But now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds,</p>\n<p>very low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved</p>",
        "<p>slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the</p>\n<p>cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning</p>\n<p>on into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner. She was</p>\n<p>stock-still but for the current.</p>\n<p>For the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my</p>\n<p>efforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.</p>\n<p>I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap;</p>",
        "<p>she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming</p>\n<p>like a swallow.</p>\n<p>My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy.</p>\n<p>Round she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she</p>\n<p>had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the</p>\n<p>distance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under</p>\n<p>her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the</p>",
        "<p>coracle.</p>\n<p>And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to</p>\n<p>think--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one</p>\n<p>swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was</p>\n<p>over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under</p>\n<p>water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged</p>\n<p>between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a</p>",
        "<p>dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the</p>\n<p>coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXV: I Strike the Jolly Roger</h3>\n<p>I had scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib</p>\n<p>flapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The</p>\n<p>schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the</p>\n<p>other sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.</p>\n<p>This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no time,</p>\n<p>crawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck.</p>",
        "<p>I was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which was</p>\n<p>still drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck.</p>\n<p>Not a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had not been swabbed since</p>\n<p>the mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken by</p>\n<p>the neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind. The jibs behind me</p>\n<p>cracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening</p>",
        "<p>heave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard,</p>\n<p>the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.</p>\n<p>There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff</p>\n<p>as a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and</p>\n<p>his teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped against</p>\n<p>the bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on</p>\n<p>the deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.</p>",
        "<p>For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the</p>\n<p>sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to</p>\n<p>and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again too</p>\n<p>there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy</p>\n<p>blow of the ship’s bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was</p>\n<p>made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided</p>\n<p>coracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea.</p>",
        "<p>At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but--what was</p>\n<p>ghastly to behold--neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing</p>\n<p>grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At every jump too, Hands</p>\n<p>appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the</p>\n<p>deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting</p>\n<p>towards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid</p>\n<p>from me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed</p>",
        "<p>ringlet of one whisker.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark</p>\n<p>blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each</p>\n<p>other in their drunken wrath.</p>\n<p>While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship</p>\n<p>was still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed</p>\n<p>himself back to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan,</p>",
        "<p>which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw</p>\n<p>hung open went right to my heart. But when I remembered the talk I had</p>\n<p>overheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me.</p>\n<p>I walked aft until I reached the main-mast.</p>\n<p>“Come aboard, Mr. Hands,” I said ironically.</p>\n<p>He rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express</p>\n<p>surprise. All he could do was to utter one word, “Brandy.”</p>",
        "<p>It occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as it</p>\n<p>once more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companion</p>\n<p>stairs into the cabin.</p>\n<p>It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the</p>\n<p>lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The floor</p>\n<p>was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after</p>\n<p>wading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted in</p>",
        "<p>clear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands.</p>\n<p>Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of</p>\n<p>the ship. One of the doctor’s medical books lay open on the table, half</p>\n<p>of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all</p>\n<p>this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.</p>\n<p>I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles</p>\n<p>a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly,</p>",
        "<p>since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober.</p>\n<p>Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and</p>\n<p>for myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch</p>\n<p>of raisins, and a piece of cheese. With these I came on deck, put down</p>\n<p>my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain’s</p>\n<p>reach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of</p>\n<p>water, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy.</p>",
        "<p>He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth.</p>\n<p>“Aye,” said he, “by thunder, but I wanted some o’ that!”</p>\n<p>I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.</p>\n<p>“Much hurt?” I asked him.</p>\n<p>He grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked.</p>\n<p>“If that doctor was aboard,” he said, “I’d be right enough in a couple</p>\n<p>of turns, but I don’t have no manner of luck, you see, and that’s what’s</p>",
        "<p>the matter with me. As for that swab, he’s good and dead, he is,” he</p>\n<p>added, indicating the man with the red cap. “He warn’t no seaman anyhow.</p>\n<p>And where mought you have come from?”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said I, “I’ve come aboard to take possession of this ship,</p>\n<p>Mr. Hands; and you’ll please regard me as your captain until further</p>\n<p>notice.”</p>\n<p>He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing. Some of the colour had</p>",
        "<p>come back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still</p>\n<p>continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about.</p>\n<p>“By the by,” I continued, “I can’t have these colours, Mr. Hands; and by</p>\n<p>your leave, I’ll strike ’em. Better none than these.”</p>\n<p>And again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down their</p>\n<p>cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.</p>\n<p>“God save the king!” said I, waving my cap. “And there’s an end to</p>",
        "<p>Captain Silver!”</p>\n<p>He watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast.</p>\n<p>“I reckon,” he said at last, “I reckon, Cap’n Hawkins, you’ll kind of</p>\n<p>want to get ashore now. S’pose we talks.”</p>\n<p>“Why, yes,” says I, “with all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on.” And I went</p>\n<p>back to my meal with a good appetite.</p>\n<p>“This man,” he began, nodding feebly at the corpse “--O’Brien were his</p>",
        "<p>name, a rank Irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning</p>\n<p>for to sail her back. Well, HE’S dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; and</p>\n<p>who’s to sail this ship, I don’t see. Without I gives you a hint, you</p>\n<p>ain’t that man, as far’s I can tell. Now, look here, you gives me food</p>\n<p>and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do, and</p>\n<p>I’ll tell you how to sail her, and that’s about square all round, I take</p>\n<p>it.”</p>",
        "<p>“I’ll tell you one thing,” says I: “I’m not going back to Captain Kidd’s</p>\n<p>anchorage. I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there.”</p>\n<p>“To be sure you did,” he cried. “Why, I ain’t sich an infernal lubber</p>\n<p>after all. I can see, can’t I? I’ve tried my fling, I have, and I’ve</p>\n<p>lost, and it’s you has the wind of me. North Inlet? Why, I haven’t no</p>\n<p>ch’ice, not I! I’d help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder!</p>\n<p>So I would.”</p>",
        "<p>Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our</p>\n<p>bargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing</p>\n<p>easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with good</p>\n<p>hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as</p>\n<p>far as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and</p>\n<p>wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land.</p>\n<p>Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I got a</p>",
        "<p>soft silk handkerchief of my mother’s. With this, and with my aid, Hands</p>\n<p>bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after</p>\n<p>he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he</p>\n<p>began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer,</p>\n<p>and looked in every way another man.</p>\n<p>The breeze served us admirably. We skimmed before it like a bird, the</p>\n<p>coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute.</p>",
        "<p>Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low, sandy country,</p>\n<p>sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that again</p>\n<p>and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the</p>\n<p>north.</p>\n<p>I was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright,</p>\n<p>sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast. I had now</p>\n<p>plenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which had</p>",
        "<p>smitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest I</p>\n<p>had made. I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but for</p>\n<p>the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck</p>\n<p>and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face. It was a smile</p>\n<p>that had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man’s</p>\n<p>smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of</p>\n<p>treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and</p>",
        "<p>watched me at my work.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXVI: Israel Hands</h3>\n<p>The wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run</p>\n<p>so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth</p>\n<p>of the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not</p>\n<p>beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our</p>\n<p>hands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many</p>\n<p>trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal.</p>",
        "<p>“Cap’n,” said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, “here’s</p>\n<p>my old shipmate, O’Brien; s’pose you was to heave him overboard. I ain’t</p>\n<p>partic’lar as a rule, and I don’t take no blame for settling his hash,</p>\n<p>but I don’t reckon him ornamental now, do you?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not strong enough, and I don’t like the job; and there he lies, for</p>\n<p>me,” said I.</p>\n<p>“This here’s an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,” he went on,</p>",
        "<p>blinking. “There’s a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a</p>\n<p>sight o’ poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to</p>\n<p>Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here</p>\n<p>O’Brien now--he’s dead, ain’t he? Well now, I’m no scholar, and you’re a</p>\n<p>lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a</p>\n<p>dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?”</p>\n<p>“You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know</p>",
        "<p>that already,” I replied. “O’Brien there is in another world, and may be</p>\n<p>watching us.”</p>\n<p>“Ah!” says he. “Well, that’s unfort’nate--appears as if killing parties</p>\n<p>was a waste of time. Howsomever, sperrits don’t reckon for much, by what</p>\n<p>I’ve seen. I’ll chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And now, you’ve spoke</p>\n<p>up free, and I’ll take it kind if you’d step down into that there cabin</p>\n<p>and get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can’t hit the name on ’t;</p>",
        "<p>well, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy’s too strong</p>\n<p>for my head.”</p>\n<p>Now, the coxswain’s hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the</p>\n<p>notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The</p>\n<p>whole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much was</p>\n<p>plain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never</p>\n<p>met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look</p>",
        "<p>to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O’Brien. All the</p>\n<p>time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty,</p>\n<p>embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on</p>\n<p>some deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where</p>\n<p>my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily</p>\n<p>conceal my suspicions to the end.</p>\n<p>“Some wine?” I said. “Far better. Will you have white or red?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, I reckon it’s about the blessed same to me, shipmate,” he</p>\n<p>replied; “so it’s strong, and plenty of it, what’s the odds?”</p>\n<p>“All right,” I answered. “I’ll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I’ll have</p>\n<p>to dig for it.”</p>\n<p>With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could,</p>\n<p>slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the</p>\n<p>forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I</p>",
        "<p>knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution</p>\n<p>possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.</p>\n<p>He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his</p>\n<p>leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear</p>\n<p>him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed</p>\n<p>himself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port</p>\n<p>scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a</p>",
        "<p>short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for</p>\n<p>a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand,</p>\n<p>and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled</p>\n<p>back again into his old place against the bulwark.</p>\n<p>This was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was</p>\n<p>now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me,</p>\n<p>it was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would do</p>",
        "<p>afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from</p>\n<p>North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long</p>\n<p>Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was,</p>\n<p>of course, more than I could say.</p>\n<p>Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that</p>\n<p>our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of</p>\n<p>the schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a</p>",
        "<p>sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off</p>\n<p>again with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was</p>\n<p>done I considered that my life would certainly be spared.</p>\n<p>While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been</p>\n<p>idle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more</p>\n<p>into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now,</p>\n<p>with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck.</p>",
        "<p>Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with</p>\n<p>his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. He</p>\n<p>looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like</p>\n<p>a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his</p>\n<p>favourite toast of “Here’s luck!” Then he lay quiet for a little, and</p>\n<p>then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid.</p>\n<p>“Cut me a junk o’ that,” says he, “for I haven’t no knife and hardly</p>",
        "<p>strength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I’ve missed</p>\n<p>stays! Cut me a quid, as’ll likely be the last, lad, for I’m for my long</p>\n<p>home, and no mistake.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said I, “I’ll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thought</p>\n<p>myself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” said he. “Now, you tell me why.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” I cried. “You were asking me just now about the dead. You’ve</p>",
        "<p>broken your trust; you’ve lived in sin and lies and blood; there’s a man</p>\n<p>you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! For God’s</p>\n<p>mercy, Mr. Hands, that’s why.”</p>\n<p>I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden</p>\n<p>in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He,</p>\n<p>for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most</p>\n<p>unusual solemnity.</p>",
        "<p>“For thirty years,” he said, “I’ve sailed the seas and seen good and</p>\n<p>bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out,</p>\n<p>knives going, and what not. Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come</p>\n<p>o’ goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don’t bite;</p>\n<p>them’s my views--amen, so be it. And now, you look here,” he added,</p>\n<p>suddenly changing his tone, “we’ve had about enough of this foolery. The</p>\n<p>tide’s made good enough by now. You just take my orders, Cap’n Hawkins,</p>",
        "<p>and we’ll sail slap in and be done with it.”</p>\n<p>All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was</p>\n<p>delicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow</p>\n<p>and shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicely</p>\n<p>handled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am</p>\n<p>very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about</p>\n<p>and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that</p>",
        "<p>were a pleasure to behold.</p>\n<p>Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. The</p>\n<p>shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern</p>\n<p>anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in</p>\n<p>truth it was, the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southern</p>\n<p>end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. It</p>\n<p>had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to</p>",
        "<p>the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of</p>\n<p>dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and</p>\n<p>now flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us</p>\n<p>that the anchorage was calm.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Hands, “look there; there’s a pet bit for to beach a ship</p>\n<p>in. Fine flat sand, never a cat’s paw, trees all around of it, and</p>\n<p>flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship.”</p>",
        "<p>“And once beached,” I inquired, “how shall we get her off again?”</p>\n<p>“Why, so,” he replied: “you take a line ashore there on the other side</p>\n<p>at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back,</p>\n<p>take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. Come high</p>\n<p>water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet</p>\n<p>as natur’. And now, boy, you stand by. We’re near the bit now, and she’s</p>\n<p>too much way on her. Starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboard</p>",
        "<p>a little--steady--steady!”</p>\n<p>So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till, all of a</p>\n<p>sudden, he cried, “Now, my hearty, luff!” And I put the helm hard up,</p>\n<p>and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low,</p>\n<p>wooded shore.</p>\n<p>The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the</p>\n<p>watch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain. Even then</p>",
        "<p>I was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I</p>\n<p>had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over</p>\n<p>the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before</p>\n<p>the bows. I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a</p>\n<p>sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. Perhaps I</p>\n<p>had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye;</p>\n<p>perhaps it was an instinct like a cat’s; but, sure enough, when I looked</p>",
        "<p>round, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in</p>\n<p>his right hand.</p>\n<p>We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine</p>\n<p>was the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging</p>\n<p>bully’s. At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leapt</p>\n<p>sideways towards the bows. As I did so, I let go of the tiller, which</p>\n<p>sprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struck</p>",
        "<p>Hands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead.</p>\n<p>Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me</p>\n<p>trapped, with all the deck to dodge about. Just forward of the main-mast</p>\n<p>I stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had</p>\n<p>already turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the</p>\n<p>trigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound;</p>\n<p>the priming was useless with sea-water. I cursed myself for my neglect.</p>",
        "<p>Why had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? Then</p>\n<p>I should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.</p>\n<p>Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled</p>\n<p>hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign</p>\n<p>with his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other pistol, nor</p>\n<p>indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless. One thing I</p>\n<p>saw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily</p>",
        "<p>hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed</p>\n<p>me in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the</p>\n<p>blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.</p>\n<p>I placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness,</p>\n<p>and waited, every nerve upon the stretch.</p>\n<p>Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed</p>\n<p>in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. It was such</p>",
        "<p>a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove,</p>\n<p>but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as</p>\n<p>now. Still, as I say, it was a boy’s game, and I thought I could hold</p>\n<p>my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed my</p>\n<p>courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting</p>\n<p>thoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw</p>\n<p>certainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any</p>",
        "<p>ultimate escape.</p>\n<p>Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck,</p>\n<p>staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a</p>\n<p>blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle</p>\n<p>of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the</p>\n<p>scupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.</p>\n<p>We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost</p>",
        "<p>together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still</p>\n<p>spread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that my</p>\n<p>head came against the coxswain’s foot with a crack that made my teeth</p>\n<p>rattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got</p>\n<p>involved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the</p>\n<p>deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape,</p>\n<p>and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as</p>",
        "<p>thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand,</p>\n<p>and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.</p>\n<p>I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot</p>\n<p>below me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands</p>\n<p>with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of</p>\n<p>surprise and disappointment.</p>\n<p>Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the</p>",
        "<p>priming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to</p>\n<p>make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other</p>\n<p>and recharge it afresh from the beginning.</p>\n<p>My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice</p>\n<p>going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled</p>\n<p>himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began</p>\n<p>slowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans</p>",
        "<p>to haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my</p>\n<p>arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. Then,</p>\n<p>with a pistol in either hand, I addressed him.</p>\n<p>“One more step, Mr. Hands,” said I, “and I’ll blow your brains out! Dead</p>\n<p>men don’t bite, you know,” I added with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>He stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face that he was</p>\n<p>trying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my</p>",
        "<p>new-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, he</p>\n<p>spoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.</p>\n<p>In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in all</p>\n<p>else he remained unmoved.</p>\n<p>“Jim,” says he, “I reckon we’re fouled, you and me, and we’ll have to</p>\n<p>sign articles. I’d have had you but for that there lurch, but I don’t</p>\n<p>have no luck, not I; and I reckon I’ll have to strike, which comes hard,</p>",
        "<p>you see, for a master mariner to a ship’s younker like you, Jim.”</p>\n<p>I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock</p>\n<p>upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his</p>\n<p>shoulder. Something sang like an arrow through the air; I felt a blow</p>\n<p>and then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the</p>\n<p>mast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can say</p>\n<p>it was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a conscious</p>",
        "<p>aim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands. They</p>\n<p>did not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp</p>\n<p>upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXVII: “Pieces of Eight”</h3>\n<p>Owing to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water,</p>\n<p>and from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but the</p>\n<p>surface of the bay. Hands, who was not so far up, was in consequence</p>\n<p>nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks. He rose once to</p>\n<p>the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good.</p>\n<p>As the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together on the</p>",
        "<p>clean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel’s sides. A fish or two</p>\n<p>whipped past his body. Sometimes, by the quivering of the water, he</p>\n<p>appeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise. But he was dead</p>\n<p>enough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish</p>\n<p>in the very place where he had designed my slaughter.</p>\n<p>I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick, faint, and</p>\n<p>terrified. The hot blood was running over my back and chest. The dirk,</p>",
        "<p>where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot</p>\n<p>iron; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me,</p>\n<p>for these, it seemed to me, I could bear without a murmur; it was the</p>\n<p>horror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that</p>\n<p>still green water, beside the body of the coxswain.</p>\n<p>I clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if to</p>\n<p>cover up the peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted</p>",
        "<p>down to a more natural time, and I was once more in possession of</p>\n<p>myself.</p>\n<p>It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck too</p>\n<p>hard or my nerve failed me, and I desisted with a violent shudder. Oddly</p>\n<p>enough, that very shudder did the business. The knife, in fact, had come</p>\n<p>the nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a mere</p>\n<p>pinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. The blood ran down the</p>",
        "<p>faster, to be sure, but I was my own master again and only tacked to the</p>\n<p>mast by my coat and shirt.</p>\n<p>These last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained the</p>\n<p>deck by the starboard shrouds. For nothing in the world would I have</p>\n<p>again ventured, shaken as I was, upon the overhanging port shrouds from</p>\n<p>which Israel had so lately fallen.</p>\n<p>I went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good deal</p>",
        "<p>and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it</p>\n<p>greatly gall me when I used my arm. Then I looked around me, and as the</p>\n<p>ship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it from</p>\n<p>its last passenger--the dead man, O’Brien.</p>\n<p>He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay</p>\n<p>like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how</p>\n<p>different from life’s colour or life’s comeliness! In that position</p>",
        "<p>I could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical</p>\n<p>adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him</p>\n<p>by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave,</p>\n<p>tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding plunge; the red cap</p>\n<p>came off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splash</p>\n<p>subsided, I could see him and Israel lying side by side, both wavering</p>\n<p>with the tremulous movement of the water. O’Brien, though still quite a</p>",
        "<p>young man, was very bald. There he lay, with that bald head across the</p>\n<p>knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and</p>\n<p>fro over both.</p>\n<p>I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. The sun was</p>\n<p>within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines</p>\n<p>upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and</p>\n<p>fall in patterns on the deck. The evening breeze had sprung up, and</p>",
        "<p>though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the</p>\n<p>east, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the</p>\n<p>idle sails to rattle to and fro.</p>\n<p>I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused and</p>\n<p>brought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. Of</p>\n<p>course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and</p>\n<p>the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought</p>",
        "<p>this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I</p>\n<p>half feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. The</p>\n<p>peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon</p>\n<p>the water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall,</p>\n<p>that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the</p>\n<p>HISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like myself.</p>\n<p>By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays,</p>",
        "<p>I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as</p>\n<p>jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. It began to be chill; the</p>\n<p>tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more</p>\n<p>on her beam-ends.</p>\n<p>I scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed shallow enough, and</p>\n<p>holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myself</p>\n<p>drop softly overboard. The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was</p>",
        "<p>firm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits,</p>\n<p>leaving the HISPANIOLA on her side, with her main-sail trailing wide</p>\n<p>upon the surface of the bay. About the same time, the sun went fairly</p>\n<p>down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.</p>\n<p>At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned thence</p>\n<p>empty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers</p>\n<p>and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. I had nothing</p>",
        "<p>nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my</p>\n<p>achievements. Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the</p>\n<p>recapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer, and I hoped that</p>\n<p>even Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time.</p>\n<p>So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward for</p>\n<p>the block house and my companions. I remembered that the most easterly</p>\n<p>of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd’s anchorage ran from the</p>",
        "<p>two-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction</p>\n<p>that I might pass the stream while it was small. The wood was pretty</p>\n<p>open, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the corner</p>\n<p>of that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the</p>\n<p>watercourse.</p>\n<p>This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon;</p>\n<p>and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. The dusk</p>",
        "<p>had come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between the</p>\n<p>two peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as</p>\n<p>I judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring</p>\n<p>fire. And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so</p>\n<p>careless. For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes</p>\n<p>of Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?</p>\n<p>Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide myself</p>",
        "<p>even roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and the</p>\n<p>Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few</p>\n<p>and pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among</p>\n<p>bushes and rolling into sandy pits.</p>\n<p>Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked up; a pale glimmer</p>\n<p>of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass, and soon after</p>\n<p>I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and</p>",
        "<p>knew the moon had risen.</p>\n<p>With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my</p>\n<p>journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near</p>\n<p>to the stockade. Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies before</p>\n<p>it, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a</p>\n<p>trifle warily. It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get</p>\n<p>shot down by my own party in mistake.</p>",
        "<p>The moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall here</p>\n<p>and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood, and</p>\n<p>right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among</p>\n<p>the trees. It was red and hot, and now and again it was a little</p>\n<p>darkened--as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering.</p>\n<p>For the life of me I could not think what it might be.</p>\n<p>At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing. The western</p>",
        "<p>end was already steeped in moonshine; the rest, and the block house</p>\n<p>itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks</p>\n<p>of light. On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned</p>\n<p>itself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation,</p>\n<p>contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon. There was not</p>\n<p>a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze.</p>\n<p>I stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror</p>",
        "<p>also. It had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed,</p>\n<p>by the captain’s orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and I began to</p>\n<p>fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent.</p>\n<p>I stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and at a</p>\n<p>convenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the palisade.</p>\n<p>To make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and knees and crawled,</p>\n<p>without a sound, towards the corner of the house. As I drew nearer, my</p>",
        "<p>heart was suddenly and greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant noise in</p>\n<p>itself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just</p>\n<p>then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and</p>\n<p>peaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful “All’s</p>\n<p>well,” never fell more reassuringly on my ear.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an infamous</p>\n<p>bad watch. If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping</p>",
        "<p>in on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. That was what it</p>\n<p>was, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and again I blamed myself</p>\n<p>sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard.</p>\n<p>By this time I had got to the door and stood up. All was dark within,</p>\n<p>so that I could distinguish nothing by the eye. As for sounds, there</p>\n<p>was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a</p>\n<p>flickering or pecking that I could in no way account for.</p>",
        "<p>With my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own</p>\n<p>place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they</p>\n<p>found me in the morning.</p>\n<p>My foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper’s leg; and he turned</p>\n<p>and groaned, but without awaking.</p>\n<p>And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the</p>\n<p>darkness:</p>",
        "<p>“Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!</p>\n<p>Pieces of eight!” and so forth, without pause or change, like the</p>\n<p>clacking of a tiny mill.</p>\n<p>Silver’s green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard</p>\n<p>pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any</p>\n<p>human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain.</p>\n<p>I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the</p>",
        "<p>parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the</p>\n<p>voice of Silver cried, “Who goes?”</p>\n<p>I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran</p>\n<p>full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me</p>\n<p>tight.</p>\n<p>“Bring a torch, Dick,” said Silver when my capture was thus assured.</p>\n<p>And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a</p>",
        "<p>lighted brand.</p>",
        "<h3>PART SIX: Captain Silver</h3>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXVIII: In the Enemy’s Camp</h3>\n<p>The red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house,</p>\n<p>showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in</p>\n<p>possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac,</p>\n<p>there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased</p>\n<p>my horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge that all had</p>\n<p>perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to</p>",
        "<p>perish with them.</p>\n<p>There were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was left</p>\n<p>alive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly</p>\n<p>called out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth had only risen</p>\n<p>upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round</p>\n<p>his head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently</p>\n<p>dressed. I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among</p>",
        "<p>the woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.</p>\n<p>The parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John’s shoulder. He</p>\n<p>himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used</p>\n<p>to. He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his</p>\n<p>mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and</p>\n<p>torn with the sharp briers of the wood.</p>\n<p>“So,” said he, “here’s Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers! Dropped in, like,</p>",
        "<p>eh? Well, come, I take that friendly.”</p>\n<p>And thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a</p>\n<p>pipe.</p>\n<p>“Give me a loan of the link, Dick,” said he; and then, when he had a</p>\n<p>good light, “That’ll do, lad,” he added; “stick the glim in the wood</p>\n<p>heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn’t stand up</p>\n<p>for Mr. Hawkins; HE’LL excuse you, you may lay to that. And so,</p>",
        "<p>Jim”--stopping the tobacco--“here you were, and quite a pleasant</p>\n<p>surprise for poor old John. I see you were smart when first I set my</p>\n<p>eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do.”</p>\n<p>To all this, as may be well supposed, I made no answer. They had set me</p>\n<p>with my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the</p>\n<p>face, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black</p>\n<p>despair in my heart.</p>",
        "<p>Silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran</p>\n<p>on again.</p>\n<p>“Now, you see, Jim, so be as you ARE here,” says he, “I’ll give you a</p>\n<p>piece of my mind. I’ve always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit,</p>\n<p>and the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome. I always</p>\n<p>wanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my</p>\n<p>cock, you’ve got to. Cap’n Smollett’s a fine seaman, as I’ll own up to</p>",
        "<p>any day, but stiff on discipline. ‘Dooty is dooty,’ says he, and right</p>\n<p>he is. Just you keep clear of the cap’n. The doctor himself is gone dead</p>\n<p>again’ you--‘ungrateful scamp’ was what he said; and the short and the</p>\n<p>long of the whole story is about here: you can’t go back to your own</p>\n<p>lot, for they won’t have you; and without you start a third ship’s</p>\n<p>company all by yourself, which might be lonely, you’ll have to jine with</p>\n<p>Cap’n Silver.”</p>",
        "<p>So far so good. My friends, then, were still alive, and though I partly</p>\n<p>believed the truth of Silver’s statement, that the cabin party were</p>\n<p>incensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved than distressed by</p>\n<p>what I heard.</p>\n<p>“I don’t say nothing as to your being in our hands,” continued Silver,</p>\n<p>“though there you are, and you may lay to it. I’m all for argyment; I</p>\n<p>never seen good come out o’ threatening. If you like the service, well,</p>",
        "<p>you’ll jine; and if you don’t, Jim, why, you’re free to answer no--free</p>\n<p>and welcome, shipmate; and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman,</p>\n<p>shiver my sides!”</p>\n<p>“Am I to answer, then?” I asked with a very tremulous voice. Through all</p>\n<p>this sneering talk, I was made to feel the threat of death that overhung</p>\n<p>me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.</p>\n<p>“Lad,” said Silver, “no one’s a-pressing of you. Take your bearings.</p>",
        "<p>None of us won’t hurry you, mate; time goes so pleasant in your company,</p>\n<p>you see.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” says I, growing a bit bolder, “if I’m to choose, I declare I</p>\n<p>have a right to know what’s what, and why you’re here, and where my</p>\n<p>friends are.”</p>\n<p>“Wot’s wot?” repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl. “Ah, he’d</p>\n<p>be a lucky one as knowed that!”</p>",
        "<p>“You’ll perhaps batten down your hatches till you’re spoke to, my</p>\n<p>friend,” cried Silver truculently to this speaker. And then, in</p>\n<p>his first gracious tones, he replied to me, “Yesterday morning, Mr.</p>\n<p>Hawkins,” said he, “in the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with a</p>\n<p>flag of truce. Says he, ‘Cap’n Silver, you’re sold out. Ship’s gone.’</p>\n<p>Well, maybe we’d been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. I</p>\n<p>won’t say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and</p>",
        "<p>by thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a pack o’ fools look</p>\n<p>fishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the</p>\n<p>fishiest. ‘Well,’ says the doctor, ‘let’s bargain.’ We bargained, him</p>\n<p>and I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you</p>\n<p>was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole</p>\n<p>blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. As for them, they’ve tramped;</p>\n<p>I don’t know where’s they are.”</p>",
        "<p>He drew again quietly at his pipe.</p>\n<p>“And lest you should take it into that head of yours,” he went on, “that</p>\n<p>you was included in the treaty, here’s the last word that was said: ‘How</p>\n<p>many are you,’ says I, ‘to leave?’ ‘Four,’ says he; ‘four, and one of us</p>\n<p>wounded. As for that boy, I don’t know where he is, confound him,’ says</p>\n<p>he, ‘nor I don’t much care. We’re about sick of him.’ These was his</p>\n<p>words.”</p>",
        "<p>“Is that all?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Well, it’s all that you’re to hear, my son,” returned Silver.</p>\n<p>“And now I am to choose?”</p>\n<p>“And now you are to choose, and you may lay to that,” said Silver.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said I, “I am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have</p>\n<p>to look for. Let the worst come to the worst, it’s little I care. I’ve</p>\n<p>seen too many die since I fell in with you. But there’s a thing or two</p>",
        "<p>I have to tell you,” I said, and by this time I was quite excited; “and</p>\n<p>the first is this: here you are, in a bad way--ship lost, treasure lost,</p>\n<p>men lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who</p>\n<p>did it--it was I! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land,</p>\n<p>and I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at</p>\n<p>the bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was</p>\n<p>out. And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I</p>",
        "<p>that killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her</p>\n<p>where you’ll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh’s on my side;</p>\n<p>I’ve had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you</p>\n<p>than I fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me. But one thing</p>\n<p>I’ll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when</p>\n<p>you fellows are in court for piracy, I’ll save you all I can. It is for</p>\n<p>you to choose. Kill another and do yourselves no good, or spare me and</p>",
        "<p>keep a witness to save you from the gallows.”</p>\n<p>I stopped, for, I tell you, I was out of breath, and to my wonder, not</p>\n<p>a man of them moved, but all sat staring at me like as many sheep. And</p>\n<p>while they were still staring, I broke out again, “And now, Mr. Silver,”</p>\n<p>I said, “I believe you’re the best man here, and if things go to the</p>\n<p>worst, I’ll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took</p>\n<p>it.”</p>",
        "<p>“I’ll bear it in mind,” said Silver with an accent so curious that I</p>\n<p>could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my</p>\n<p>request or had been favourably affected by my courage.</p>\n<p>“I’ll put one to that,” cried the old mahogany-faced seaman--Morgan</p>\n<p>by name--whom I had seen in Long John’s public-house upon the quays of</p>\n<p>Bristol. “It was him that knowed Black Dog.”</p>\n<p>“Well, and see here,” added the sea-cook. “I’ll put another again to</p>",
        "<p>that, by thunder! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from</p>\n<p>Billy Bones. First and last, we’ve split upon Jim Hawkins!”</p>\n<p>“Then here goes!” said Morgan with an oath.</p>\n<p>And he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.</p>\n<p>“Avast, there!” cried Silver. “Who are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you</p>\n<p>thought you was cap’n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I’ll teach you</p>\n<p>better! Cross me, and you’ll go where many a good man’s gone before you,</p>",
        "<p>first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver</p>\n<p>my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There’s</p>\n<p>never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a’terwards,</p>\n<p>Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.”</p>\n<p>Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others.</p>\n<p>“Tom’s right,” said one.</p>\n<p>“I stood hazing long enough from one,” added another. “I’ll be hanged if</p>",
        "<p>I’ll be hazed by you, John Silver.”</p>\n<p>“Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?” roared Silver,</p>\n<p>bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still</p>\n<p>glowing in his right hand. “Put a name on what you’re at; you ain’t</p>\n<p>dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many</p>\n<p>years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the</p>\n<p>latter end of it? You know the way; you’re all gentlemen o’ fortune, by</p>",
        "<p>your account. Well, I’m ready. Take a cutlass, him that dares, and I’ll</p>\n<p>see the colour of his inside, crutch and all, before that pipe’s empty.”</p>\n<p>Not a man stirred; not a man answered.</p>\n<p>“That’s your sort, is it?” he added, returning his pipe to his mouth.</p>\n<p>“Well, you’re a gay lot to look at, anyway. Not much worth to fight, you</p>\n<p>ain’t. P’r’aps you can understand King George’s English. I’m cap’n here</p>\n<p>by ’lection. I’m cap’n here because I’m the best man by a long sea-mile.</p>",
        "<p>You won’t fight, as gentlemen o’ fortune should; then, by thunder,</p>\n<p>you’ll obey, and you may lay to it! I like that boy, now; I never seen</p>\n<p>a better boy than that. He’s more a man than any pair of rats of you in</p>\n<p>this here house, and what I say is this: let me see him that’ll lay a</p>\n<p>hand on him--that’s what I say, and you may lay to it.”</p>\n<p>There was a long pause after this. I stood straight up against the wall,</p>\n<p>my heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray of hope</p>",
        "<p>now shining in my bosom. Silver leant back against the wall, his arms</p>\n<p>crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had</p>\n<p>been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the</p>\n<p>tail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part, drew gradually</p>\n<p>together towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of</p>\n<p>their whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. One</p>\n<p>after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would</p>",
        "<p>fall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it</p>\n<p>was towards Silver that they turned their eyes.</p>\n<p>“You seem to have a lot to say,” remarked Silver, spitting far into the</p>\n<p>air. “Pipe up and let me hear it, or lay to.”</p>\n<p>“Ax your pardon, sir,” returned one of the men; “you’re pretty free with</p>\n<p>some of the rules; maybe you’ll kindly keep an eye upon the rest. This</p>\n<p>crew’s dissatisfied; this crew don’t vally bullying a marlin-spike; this</p>",
        "<p>crew has its rights like other crews, I’ll make so free as that; and by</p>\n<p>your own rules, I take it we can talk together. I ax your pardon, sir,</p>\n<p>acknowledging you for to be capting at this present; but I claim my</p>\n<p>right, and steps outside for a council.”</p>\n<p>And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking,</p>\n<p>yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and</p>\n<p>disappeared out of the house. One after another the rest followed his</p>",
        "<p>example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology.</p>\n<p>“According to rules,” said one. “Forecastle council,” said Morgan. And</p>\n<p>so with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me</p>\n<p>alone with the torch.</p>\n<p>The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.</p>\n<p>“Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins,” he said in a steady whisper that was</p>\n<p>no more than audible, “you’re within half a plank of death, and what’s</p>",
        "<p>a long sight worse, of torture. They’re going to throw me off. But, you</p>\n<p>mark, I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn’t mean to; no, not</p>\n<p>till you spoke up. I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and</p>\n<p>be hanged into the bargain. But I see you was the right sort. I says to</p>\n<p>myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins’ll stand by you. You’re</p>\n<p>his last card, and by the living thunder, John, he’s yours! Back to</p>\n<p>back, says I. You save your witness, and he’ll save your neck!”</p>",
        "<p>I began dimly to understand.</p>\n<p>“You mean all’s lost?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Aye, by gum, I do!” he answered. “Ship gone, neck gone--that’s the</p>\n<p>size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no</p>\n<p>schooner--well, I’m tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their</p>\n<p>council, mark me, they’re outright fools and cowards. I’ll save your</p>\n<p>life--if so be as I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you</p>",
        "<p>save Long John from swinging.”</p>\n<p>I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the</p>\n<p>old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.</p>\n<p>“What I can do, that I’ll do,” I said.</p>\n<p>“It’s a bargain!” cried Long John. “You speak up plucky, and by thunder,</p>\n<p>I’ve a chance!”</p>\n<p>He hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and</p>",
        "<p>took a fresh light to his pipe.</p>\n<p>“Understand me, Jim,” he said, returning. “I’ve a head on my shoulders,</p>\n<p>I have. I’m on squire’s side now. I know you’ve got that ship safe</p>\n<p>somewheres. How you done it, I don’t know, but safe it is. I guess Hands</p>\n<p>and O’Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of THEM. Now</p>\n<p>you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won’t let others. I know when</p>\n<p>a game’s up, I do; and I know a lad that’s staunch. Ah, you that’s</p>",
        "<p>young--you and me might have done a power of good together!”</p>\n<p>He drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin.</p>\n<p>“Will you taste, messmate?” he asked; and when I had refused: “Well,</p>\n<p>I’ll take a dram myself, Jim,” said he. “I need a caulker, for there’s</p>\n<p>trouble on hand. And talking o’ trouble, why did that doctor give me the</p>\n<p>chart, Jim?”</p>\n<p>My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of</p>",
        "<p>further questions.</p>\n<p>“Ah, well, he did, though,” said he. “And there’s something under that,</p>\n<p>no doubt--something, surely, under that, Jim--bad or good.”</p>\n<p>And he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head</p>\n<p>like a man who looks forward to the worst.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXIX: The Black Spot Again</h3>\n<p>The council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them</p>\n<p>re-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which</p>\n<p>had in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment’s loan of the torch.</p>\n<p>Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us</p>\n<p>together in the dark.</p>\n<p>“There’s a breeze coming, Jim,” said Silver, who had by this time</p>",
        "<p>adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.</p>\n<p>I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the</p>\n<p>great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and</p>\n<p>duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About</p>\n<p>half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group;</p>\n<p>one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw</p>\n<p>the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in</p>",
        "<p>the moon and torchlight. The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though</p>\n<p>watching the manoeuvres of this last. I could just make out that he</p>\n<p>had a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how</p>\n<p>anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling</p>\n<p>figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move</p>\n<p>together towards the house.</p>\n<p>“Here they come,” said I; and I returned to my former position, for it</p>",
        "<p>seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them.</p>\n<p>“Well, let ’em come, lad--let ’em come,” said Silver cheerily. “I’ve</p>\n<p>still a shot in my locker.”</p>\n<p>The door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together just</p>\n<p>inside, pushed one of their number forward. In any other circumstances</p>\n<p>it would have been comical to see his slow advance, hesitating as he set</p>\n<p>down each foot, but holding his closed right hand in front of him.</p>",
        "<p>“Step up, lad,” cried Silver. “I won’t eat you. Hand it over, lubber. I</p>\n<p>know the rules, I do; I won’t hurt a depytation.”</p>\n<p>Thus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having</p>\n<p>passed something to Silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more smartly</p>\n<p>back again to his companions.</p>\n<p>The sea-cook looked at what had been given him.</p>\n<p>“The black spot! I thought so,” he observed. “Where might you have got</p>",
        "<p>the paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain’t lucky! You’ve gone and</p>\n<p>cut this out of a Bible. What fool’s cut a Bible?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, there!” said Morgan. “There! Wot did I say? No good’ll come o’</p>\n<p>that, I said.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you’ve about fixed it now, among you,” continued Silver. “You’ll</p>\n<p>all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?”</p>\n<p>“It was Dick,” said one.</p>",
        "<p>“Dick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,” said Silver. “He’s seen</p>\n<p>his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.”</p>\n<p>But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in.</p>\n<p>“Belay that talk, John Silver,” he said. “This crew has tipped you the</p>\n<p>black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as</p>\n<p>in dooty bound, and see what’s wrote there. Then you can talk.”</p>\n<p>“Thanky, George,” replied the sea-cook. “You always was brisk for</p>",
        "<p>business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I’m pleased to see.</p>\n<p>Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! ‘Deposed’--that’s it, is it? Very pretty</p>\n<p>wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o’ write, George? Why,</p>\n<p>you was gettin’ quite a leadin’ man in this here crew. You’ll be cap’n</p>\n<p>next, I shouldn’t wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will</p>\n<p>you? This pipe don’t draw.”</p>\n<p>“Come, now,” said George, “you don’t fool this crew no more. You’re a</p>",
        "<p>funny man, by your account; but you’re over now, and you’ll maybe step</p>\n<p>down off that barrel and help vote.”</p>\n<p>“I thought you said you knowed the rules,” returned Silver</p>\n<p>contemptuously. “Leastways, if you don’t, I do; and I wait here--and I’m</p>\n<p>still your cap’n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply;</p>\n<p>in the meantime, your black spot ain’t worth a biscuit. After that,</p>\n<p>we’ll see.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh,” replied George, “you don’t be under no kind of apprehension; WE’RE</p>\n<p>all square, we are. First, you’ve made a hash of this cruise--you’ll be</p>\n<p>a bold man to say no to that. Second, you let the enemy out o’ this here</p>\n<p>trap for nothing. Why did they want out? I dunno, but it’s pretty plain</p>\n<p>they wanted it. Third, you wouldn’t let us go at them upon the march.</p>\n<p>Oh, we see through you, John Silver; you want to play booty, that’s</p>\n<p>what’s wrong with you. And then, fourth, there’s this here boy.”</p>",
        "<p>“Is that all?” asked Silver quietly.</p>\n<p>“Enough, too,” retorted George. “We’ll all swing and sun-dry for your</p>\n<p>bungling.”</p>\n<p>“Well now, look here, I’ll answer these four p’ints; one after another</p>\n<p>I’ll answer ’em. I made a hash o’ this cruise, did I? Well now, you all</p>\n<p>know what I wanted, and you all know if that had been done that we’d</p>\n<p>’a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was, every man of us</p>",
        "<p>alive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure in the hold</p>\n<p>of her, by thunder! Well, who crossed me? Who forced my hand, as was the</p>\n<p>lawful cap’n? Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began</p>\n<p>this dance? Ah, it’s a fine dance--I’m with you there--and looks mighty</p>\n<p>like a hornpipe in a rope’s end at Execution Dock by London town, it</p>\n<p>does. But who done it? Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George</p>\n<p>Merry! And you’re the last above board of that same meddling crew;</p>",
        "<p>and you have the Davy Jones’s insolence to up and stand for cap’n over</p>\n<p>me--you, that sank the lot of us! By the powers! But this tops the</p>\n<p>stiffest yarn to nothing.”</p>\n<p>Silver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his late</p>\n<p>comrades that these words had not been said in vain.</p>\n<p>“That’s for number one,” cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his</p>\n<p>brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house.</p>",
        "<p>“Why, I give you my word, I’m sick to speak to you. You’ve neither sense</p>\n<p>nor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you</p>\n<p>come to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o’ fortune! I reckon tailors is your trade.”</p>\n<p>“Go on, John,” said Morgan. “Speak up to the others.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, the others!” returned John. “They’re a nice lot, ain’t they? You</p>\n<p>say this cruise is bungled. Ah! By gum, if you could understand how bad</p>\n<p>it’s bungled, you would see! We’re that near the gibbet that my neck’s</p>",
        "<p>stiff with thinking on it. You’ve seen ’em, maybe, hanged in chains,</p>\n<p>birds about ’em, seamen p’inting ’em out as they go down with the tide.</p>\n<p>‘Who’s that?’ says one. ‘That! Why, that’s John Silver. I knowed him</p>\n<p>well,’ says another. And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go</p>\n<p>about and reach for the other buoy. Now, that’s about where we are,</p>\n<p>every mother’s son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and</p>\n<p>other ruination fools of you. And if you want to know about number four,</p>",
        "<p>and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn’t he a hostage? Are we a-going</p>\n<p>to waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I</p>\n<p>shouldn’t wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah,</p>\n<p>well, there’s a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don’t count it</p>\n<p>nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John,</p>\n<p>with your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes</p>\n<p>upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel</p>",
        "<p>to this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn’t know</p>\n<p>there was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till</p>\n<p>then; and we’ll see who’ll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to</p>\n<p>that. And as for number two, and why I made a bargain--well, you came</p>\n<p>crawling on your knees to me to make it--on your knees you came, you was</p>\n<p>that downhearted--and you’d have starved too if I hadn’t--but that’s a</p>\n<p>trifle! You look there--that’s why!”</p>",
        "<p>And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly</p>\n<p>recognized--none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three</p>\n<p>red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the</p>\n<p>captain’s chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I</p>\n<p>could fancy.</p>\n<p>But if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was</p>\n<p>incredible to the surviving mutineers. They leaped upon it like cats</p>",
        "<p>upon a mouse. It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another;</p>\n<p>and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they</p>\n<p>accompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they</p>\n<p>were fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in</p>\n<p>safety.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said one, “that’s Flint, sure enough. J. F., and a score below,</p>\n<p>with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever.”</p>",
        "<p>“Mighty pretty,” said George. “But how are we to get away with it, and</p>\n<p>us no ship.”</p>\n<p>Silver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand against</p>\n<p>the wall: “Now I give you warning, George,” he cried. “One more word</p>\n<p>of your sauce, and I’ll call you down and fight you. How? Why, how do I</p>\n<p>know? You had ought to tell me that--you and the rest, that lost me my</p>\n<p>schooner, with your interference, burn you! But not you, you can’t; you</p>",
        "<p>hain’t got the invention of a cockroach. But civil you can speak, and</p>\n<p>shall, George Merry, you may lay to that.”</p>\n<p>“That’s fair enow,” said the old man Morgan.</p>\n<p>“Fair! I reckon so,” said the sea-cook. “You lost the ship; I found the</p>\n<p>treasure. Who’s the better man at that? And now I resign, by thunder!</p>\n<p>Elect whom you please to be your cap’n now; I’m done with it.”</p>\n<p>“Silver!” they cried. “Barbecue forever! Barbecue for cap’n!”</p>",
        "<p>“So that’s the toon, is it?” cried the cook. “George, I reckon you’ll</p>\n<p>have to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I’m not a</p>\n<p>revengeful man. But that was never my way. And now, shipmates, this</p>\n<p>black spot? ’Tain’t much good now, is it? Dick’s crossed his luck and</p>\n<p>spoiled his Bible, and that’s about all.”</p>\n<p>“It’ll do to kiss the book on still, won’t it?” growled Dick, who was</p>\n<p>evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself.</p>",
        "<p>“A Bible with a bit cut out!” returned Silver derisively. “Not it. It</p>\n<p>don’t bind no more’n a ballad-book.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t it, though?” cried Dick with a sort of joy. “Well, I reckon</p>\n<p>that’s worth having too.”</p>\n<p>“Here, Jim--here’s a cur’osity for you,” said Silver, and he tossed me</p>\n<p>the paper.</p>\n<p>It was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was blank,</p>",
        "<p>for it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of</p>\n<p>Revelation--these words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon</p>\n<p>my mind: “Without are dogs and murderers.” The printed side had been</p>\n<p>blackened with wood ash, which already began to come off and soil my</p>\n<p>fingers; on the blank side had been written with the same material the</p>\n<p>one word “Depposed.” I have that curiosity beside me at this moment, but</p>\n<p>not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a</p>",
        "<p>man might make with his thumb-nail.</p>\n<p>That was the end of the night’s business. Soon after, with a drink all</p>\n<p>round, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of Silver’s vengeance was</p>\n<p>to put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he</p>\n<p>should prove unfaithful.</p>\n<p>It was long ere I could close an eye, and heaven knows I had matter</p>\n<p>enough for thought in the man whom I had slain that afternoon, in my own</p>",
        "<p>most perilous position, and above all, in the remarkable game that I saw</p>\n<p>Silver now engaged upon--keeping the mutineers together with one hand</p>\n<p>and grasping with the other after every means, possible and impossible,</p>\n<p>to make his peace and save his miserable life. He himself slept</p>\n<p>peacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he</p>\n<p>was, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet</p>\n<p>that awaited him.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXX: On Parole</h3>\n<p>I was wakened--indeed, we were all wakened, for I could see even the</p>\n<p>sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the</p>\n<p>door-post--by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the</p>\n<p>wood:</p>\n<p>“Block house, ahoy!” it cried. “Here’s the doctor.”</p>\n<p>And the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the sound, yet my</p>",
        "<p>gladness was not without admixture. I remembered with confusion my</p>\n<p>insubordinate and stealthy conduct, and when I saw where it had brought</p>\n<p>me--among what companions and surrounded by what dangers--I felt ashamed</p>\n<p>to look him in the face.</p>\n<p>He must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly come; and when I</p>\n<p>ran to a loophole and looked out, I saw him standing, like Silver once</p>\n<p>before, up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour.</p>",
        "<p>“You, doctor! Top o’ the morning to you, sir!” cried Silver, broad awake</p>\n<p>and beaming with good nature in a moment. “Bright and early, to be sure;</p>\n<p>and it’s the early bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations.</p>\n<p>George, shake up your timbers, son, and help Dr. Livesey over the ship’s</p>\n<p>side. All a-doin’ well, your patients was--all well and merry.”</p>\n<p>So he pattered on, standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his</p>\n<p>elbow and one hand upon the side of the log-house--quite the old John in</p>",
        "<p>voice, manner, and expression.</p>\n<p>“We’ve quite a surprise for you too, sir,” he continued. “We’ve a little</p>\n<p>stranger here--he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, sir, and looking fit</p>\n<p>and taut as a fiddle; slep’ like a supercargo, he did, right alongside</p>\n<p>of John--stem to stem we was, all night.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the</p>\n<p>cook, and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said, “Not</p>",
        "<p>Jim?”</p>\n<p>“The very same Jim as ever was,” says Silver.</p>\n<p>The doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it was some</p>\n<p>seconds before he seemed able to move on.</p>\n<p>“Well, well,” he said at last, “duty first and pleasure afterwards, as</p>\n<p>you might have said yourself, Silver. Let us overhaul these patients of</p>\n<p>yours.”</p>",
        "<p>A moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim</p>\n<p>nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed under no</p>\n<p>apprehension, though he must have known that his life, among these</p>\n<p>treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on to his</p>\n<p>patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet</p>\n<p>English family. His manner, I suppose, reacted on the men, for they</p>\n<p>behaved to him as if nothing had occurred, as if he were still ship’s</p>",
        "<p>doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast.</p>\n<p>“You’re doing well, my friend,” he said to the fellow with the bandaged</p>\n<p>head, “and if ever any person had a close shave, it was you; your head</p>\n<p>must be as hard as iron. Well, George, how goes it? You’re a pretty</p>\n<p>colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. Did you take</p>\n<p>that medicine? Did he take that medicine, men?”</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough,” returned Morgan.</p>",
        "<p>“Because, you see, since I am mutineers’ doctor, or prison doctor as I</p>\n<p>prefer to call it,” says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way, “I make</p>\n<p>it a point of honour not to lose a man for King George (God bless him!)</p>\n<p>and the gallows.”</p>\n<p>The rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in</p>\n<p>silence.</p>\n<p>“Dick don’t feel well, sir,” said one.</p>",
        "<p>“Don’t he?” replied the doctor. “Well, step up here, Dick, and let me</p>\n<p>see your tongue. No, I should be surprised if he did! The man’s tongue</p>\n<p>is fit to frighten the French. Another fever.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, there,” said Morgan, “that comed of sp’iling Bibles.”</p>\n<p>“That comes--as you call it--of being arrant asses,” retorted the</p>\n<p>doctor, “and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison,</p>\n<p>and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think it most</p>",
        "<p>probable--though of course it’s only an opinion--that you’ll all have</p>\n<p>the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp</p>\n<p>in a bog, would you? Silver, I’m surprised at you. You’re less of a fool</p>\n<p>than many, take you all round; but you don’t appear to me to have the</p>\n<p>rudiments of a notion of the rules of health.</p>\n<p>“Well,” he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken</p>\n<p>his prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity</p>",
        "<p>schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates--“well, that’s</p>\n<p>done for today. And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy,</p>\n<p>please.”</p>\n<p>And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.</p>\n<p>George Merry was at the door, spitting and spluttering over some</p>\n<p>bad-tasted medicine; but at the first word of the doctor’s proposal he</p>\n<p>swung round with a deep flush and cried “No!” and swore.</p>",
        "<p>Silver struck the barrel with his open hand.</p>\n<p>“Si-lence!” he roared and looked about him positively like a lion.</p>\n<p>“Doctor,” he went on in his usual tones, “I was a-thinking of that,</p>\n<p>knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy. We’re all humbly grateful</p>\n<p>for your kindness, and as you see, puts faith in you and takes the drugs</p>\n<p>down like that much grog. And I take it I’ve found a way as’ll suit all.</p>\n<p>Hawkins, will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman--for</p>",
        "<p>a young gentleman you are, although poor born--your word of honour not</p>\n<p>to slip your cable?”</p>\n<p>I readily gave the pledge required.</p>\n<p>“Then, doctor,” said Silver, “you just step outside o’ that stockade,</p>\n<p>and once you’re there I’ll bring the boy down on the inside, and I</p>\n<p>reckon you can yarn through the spars. Good day to you, sir, and all our</p>\n<p>dooties to the squire and Cap’n Smollett.”</p>",
        "<p>The explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver’s black looks had</p>\n<p>restrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the house. Silver</p>\n<p>was roundly accused of playing double--of trying to make a separate</p>\n<p>peace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and</p>\n<p>victims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was</p>\n<p>doing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that I could not</p>\n<p>imagine how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man</p>",
        "<p>the rest were, and his last night’s victory had given him a huge</p>\n<p>preponderance on their minds. He called them all the fools and dolts</p>\n<p>you can imagine, said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor,</p>\n<p>fluttered the chart in their faces, asked them if they could afford to</p>\n<p>break the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting.</p>\n<p>“No, by thunder!” he cried. “It’s us must break the treaty when the time</p>\n<p>comes; and till then I’ll gammon that doctor, if I have to ile his boots</p>",
        "<p>with brandy.”</p>\n<p>And then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch,</p>\n<p>with his hand on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray, and silenced</p>\n<p>by his volubility rather than convinced.</p>\n<p>“Slow, lad, slow,” he said. “They might round upon us in a twinkle of an</p>\n<p>eye if we was seen to hurry.”</p>\n<p>Very deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where the</p>",
        "<p>doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we</p>\n<p>were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped.</p>\n<p>“You’ll make a note of this here also, doctor,” says he, “and the boy’ll</p>\n<p>tell you how I saved his life, and were deposed for it too, and you</p>\n<p>may lay to that. Doctor, when a man’s steering as near the wind as</p>\n<p>me--playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body, like--you</p>\n<p>wouldn’t think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word? You’ll</p>",
        "<p>please bear in mind it’s not my life only now--it’s that boy’s into the</p>\n<p>bargain; and you’ll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o’ hope to</p>\n<p>go on, for the sake of mercy.”</p>\n<p>Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his</p>\n<p>friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his</p>\n<p>voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest.</p>\n<p>“Why, John, you’re not afraid?” asked Dr. Livesey.</p>",
        "<p>“Doctor, I’m no coward; no, not I--not SO much!” and he snapped his</p>\n<p>fingers. “If I was I wouldn’t say it. But I’ll own up fairly, I’ve the</p>\n<p>shakes upon me for the gallows. You’re a good man and a true; I never</p>\n<p>seen a better man! And you’ll not forget what I done good, not any more</p>\n<p>than you’ll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside--see here--and</p>\n<p>leave you and Jim alone. And you’ll put that down for me too, for it’s a</p>\n<p>long stretch, is that!”</p>",
        "<p>So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and</p>\n<p>there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round</p>\n<p>now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me</p>\n<p>and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and</p>\n<p>fro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and</p>\n<p>the house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the</p>\n<p>breakfast.</p>",
        "<p>“So, Jim,” said the doctor sadly, “here you are. As you have brewed, so</p>\n<p>shall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to</p>\n<p>blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain</p>\n<p>Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and</p>\n<p>couldn’t help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!”</p>\n<p>I will own that I here began to weep. “Doctor,” I said, “you might spare</p>\n<p>me. I have blamed myself enough; my life’s forfeit anyway, and I should</p>",
        "<p>have been dead by now if Silver hadn’t stood for me; and doctor,</p>\n<p>believe this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is</p>\n<p>torture. If they come to torture me--”</p>\n<p>“Jim,” the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, “Jim, I</p>\n<p>can’t have this. Whip over, and we’ll run for it.”</p>\n<p>“Doctor,” said I, “I passed my word.”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know,” he cried. “We can’t help that, Jim, now. I’ll take it</p>",
        "<p>on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here,</p>\n<p>I cannot let you. Jump! One jump, and you’re out, and we’ll run for it</p>\n<p>like antelopes.”</p>\n<p>“No,” I replied; “you know right well you wouldn’t do the thing</p>\n<p>yourself--neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I. Silver</p>\n<p>trusted me; I passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor, you did not</p>\n<p>let me finish. If they come to torture me, I might let slip a word of</p>",
        "<p>where the ship is, for I got the ship, part by luck and part by risking,</p>\n<p>and she lies in North Inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high</p>\n<p>water. At half tide she must be high and dry.”</p>\n<p>“The ship!” exclaimed the doctor.</p>\n<p>Rapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in</p>\n<p>silence.</p>\n<p>“There is a kind of fate in this,” he observed when I had done. “Every</p>",
        "<p>step, it’s you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance</p>\n<p>that we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my</p>\n<p>boy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that</p>\n<p>ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by Jupiter, and</p>\n<p>talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!” he</p>\n<p>cried. “Silver! I’ll give you a piece of advice,” he continued as</p>\n<p>the cook drew near again; “don’t you be in any great hurry after that</p>",
        "<p>treasure.”</p>\n<p>“Why, sir, I do my possible, which that ain’t,” said Silver. “I can</p>\n<p>only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy’s by seeking for that</p>\n<p>treasure; and you may lay to that.”</p>\n<p>“Well, Silver,” replied the doctor, “if that is so, I’ll go one step</p>\n<p>further: look out for squalls when you find it.”</p>\n<p>“Sir,” said Silver, “as between man and man, that’s too much and too</p>",
        "<p>little. What you’re after, why you left the block house, why you given</p>\n<p>me that there chart, I don’t know, now, do I? And yet I done your</p>\n<p>bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here’s</p>\n<p>too much. If you won’t tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and</p>\n<p>I’ll leave the helm.”</p>\n<p>“No,” said the doctor musingly; “I’ve no right to say more; it’s not my</p>\n<p>secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I’d tell it you. But</p>",
        "<p>I’ll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I’ll have</p>\n<p>my wig sorted by the captain or I’m mistaken! And first, I’ll give you a</p>\n<p>bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I’ll do</p>\n<p>my best to save you, short of perjury.”</p>\n<p>Silver’s face was radiant. “You couldn’t say more, I’m sure, sir, not if</p>\n<p>you was my mother,” he cried.</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s my first concession,” added the doctor. “My second is a</p>",
        "<p>piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help,</p>\n<p>halloo. I’m off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I</p>\n<p>speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.”</p>\n<p>And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to</p>\n<p>Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXXI: The Treasure-hunt--Flint’s Pointer</h3>\n<p>“Jim,” said Silver when we were alone, “if I saved your life, you saved</p>\n<p>mine; and I’ll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for</p>\n<p>it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as</p>\n<p>hearing. Jim, that’s one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had</p>\n<p>since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we’re to go in</p>\n<p>for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don’t like</p>",
        "<p>it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we’ll save</p>\n<p>our necks in spite o’ fate and fortune.”</p>\n<p>Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and</p>\n<p>we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried</p>\n<p>junk. They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so</p>\n<p>hot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there</p>\n<p>not without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked,</p>",
        "<p>I suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an</p>\n<p>empty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared</p>\n<p>again over this unusual fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of</p>\n<p>the morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way</p>\n<p>of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they</p>\n<p>were bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their</p>\n<p>entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign.</p>",
        "<p>Even Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon his shoulder, had not</p>\n<p>a word of blame for their recklessness. And this the more surprised me,</p>\n<p>for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then.</p>\n<p>“Aye, mates,” said he, “it’s lucky you have Barbecue to think for you</p>\n<p>with this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure enough, they have</p>\n<p>the ship. Where they have it, I don’t know yet; but once we hit the</p>\n<p>treasure, we’ll have to jump about and find out. And then, mates, us</p>",
        "<p>that has the boats, I reckon, has the upper hand.”</p>\n<p>Thus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he</p>\n<p>restored their hope and confidence, and, I more than suspect, repaired</p>\n<p>his own at the same time.</p>\n<p>“As for hostage,” he continued, “that’s his last talk, I guess, with</p>\n<p>them he loves so dear. I’ve got my piece o’ news, and thanky to him</p>\n<p>for that; but it’s over and done. I’ll take him in a line when we go</p>",
        "<p>treasure-hunting, for we’ll keep him like so much gold, in case of</p>\n<p>accidents, you mark, and in the meantime. Once we got the ship and</p>\n<p>treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we’ll talk</p>\n<p>Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we’ll give him his share, to be sure, for</p>\n<p>all his kindness.”</p>\n<p>It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I</p>\n<p>was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove</p>",
        "<p>feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt</p>\n<p>it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he</p>\n<p>would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from</p>\n<p>hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side.</p>\n<p>Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith</p>\n<p>with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment</p>\n<p>that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty</p>",
        "<p>and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a</p>\n<p>boy--against five strong and active seamen!</p>\n<p>Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the</p>\n<p>behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade,</p>\n<p>their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand,</p>\n<p>the doctor’s last warning to Silver, “Look out for squalls when you</p>\n<p>find it,” and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my</p>",
        "<p>breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on</p>\n<p>the quest for treasure.</p>\n<p>We made a curious figure, had anyone been there to see us--all in soiled</p>\n<p>sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth. Silver had two guns</p>\n<p>slung about him--one before and one behind--besides the great cutlass</p>\n<p>at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat.</p>\n<p>To complete his strange appearance, Captain Flint sat perched upon his</p>",
        "<p>shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk. I had a</p>\n<p>line about my waist and followed obediently after the sea-cook, who</p>\n<p>held the loose end of the rope, now in his free hand, now between his</p>\n<p>powerful teeth. For all the world, I was led like a dancing bear.</p>\n<p>The other men were variously burthened, some carrying picks and</p>\n<p>shovels--for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore</p>\n<p>from the HISPANIOLA--others laden with pork, bread, and brandy for the</p>",
        "<p>midday meal. All the stores, I observed, came from our stock, and I</p>\n<p>could see the truth of Silver’s words the night before. Had he not</p>\n<p>struck a bargain with the doctor, he and his mutineers, deserted by the</p>\n<p>ship, must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds</p>\n<p>of their hunting. Water would have been little to their taste; a sailor</p>\n<p>is not usually a good shot; and besides all that, when they were so</p>\n<p>short of eatables, it was not likely they would be very flush of powder.</p>",
        "<p>Well, thus equipped, we all set out--even the fellow with the broken</p>\n<p>head, who should certainly have kept in shadow--and straggled, one after</p>\n<p>another, to the beach, where the two gigs awaited us. Even these bore</p>\n<p>trace of the drunken folly of the pirates, one in a broken thwart, and</p>\n<p>both in their muddy and unbailed condition. Both were to be carried</p>\n<p>along with us for the sake of safety; and so, with our numbers divided</p>\n<p>between them, we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage.</p>",
        "<p>As we pulled over, there was some discussion on the chart. The red cross</p>\n<p>was, of course, far too large to be a guide; and the terms of the note</p>\n<p>on the back, as you will hear, admitted of some ambiguity. They ran, the</p>\n<p>reader may remember, thus:</p>\n<p>Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to</p>\n<p>the N. of N.N.E.</p>\n<p>Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.</p>",
        "<p>Ten feet.</p>\n<p>A tall tree was thus the principal mark. Now, right before us the</p>\n<p>anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high,</p>\n<p>adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass</p>\n<p>and rising again towards the south into the rough, cliffy eminence</p>\n<p>called the Mizzenmast Hill. The top of the plateau was dotted thickly</p>\n<p>with pine-trees of varying height. Every here and there, one of a</p>",
        "<p>different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours,</p>\n<p>and which of these was the particular “tall tree” of Captain Flint could</p>\n<p>only be decided on the spot, and by the readings of the compass.</p>\n<p>Yet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats had</p>\n<p>picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long John alone</p>\n<p>shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there.</p>\n<p>We pulled easily, by Silver’s directions, not to weary the hands</p>",
        "<p>prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of</p>\n<p>the second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass.</p>\n<p>Thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the</p>\n<p>plateau.</p>\n<p>At the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation</p>\n<p>greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began</p>\n<p>to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its</p>",
        "<p>character and to grow in a more open order. It was, indeed, a most</p>\n<p>pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. A</p>\n<p>heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place</p>\n<p>of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with</p>\n<p>the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled</p>\n<p>their spice with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh</p>\n<p>and stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful</p>",
        "<p>refreshment to our senses.</p>\n<p>The party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting and leaping to</p>\n<p>and fro. About the centre, and a good way behind the rest, Silver and</p>\n<p>I followed--I tethered by my rope, he ploughing, with deep pants, among</p>\n<p>the sliding gravel. From time to time, indeed, I had to lend him a hand,</p>\n<p>or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill.</p>\n<p>We had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the</p>",
        "<p>brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry</p>\n<p>aloud, as if in terror. Shout after shout came from him, and the others</p>\n<p>began to run in his direction.</p>\n<p>“He can’t ’a found the treasure,” said old Morgan, hurrying past us from</p>\n<p>the right, “for that’s clean a-top.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it was something</p>\n<p>very different. At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green</p>",
        "<p>creeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human</p>\n<p>skeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground. I believe a</p>\n<p>chill struck for a moment to every heart.</p>\n<p>“He was a seaman,” said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had</p>\n<p>gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. “Leastways, this</p>\n<p>is good sea-cloth.”</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye,” said Silver; “like enough; you wouldn’t look to find a</p>",
        "<p>bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?</p>\n<p>’Tain’t in natur’.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that the body</p>\n<p>was in a natural position. But for some disarray (the work, perhaps, of</p>\n<p>the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had</p>\n<p>gradually enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight--his</p>\n<p>feet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a</p>",
        "<p>diver’s, pointing directly in the opposite.</p>\n<p>“I’ve taken a notion into my old numbskull,” observed Silver. “Here’s</p>\n<p>the compass; there’s the tip-top p’int o’ Skeleton Island, stickin’</p>\n<p>out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them</p>\n<p>bones.”</p>\n<p>It was done. The body pointed straight in the direction of the island,</p>\n<p>and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E.</p>",
        "<p>“I thought so,” cried the cook; “this here is a p’inter. Right up there</p>\n<p>is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But, by thunder!</p>\n<p>If it don’t make me cold inside to think of Flint. This is one of HIS</p>\n<p>jokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone here; he killed ’em,</p>\n<p>every man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver</p>\n<p>my timbers! They’re long bones, and the hair’s been yellow. Aye, that</p>\n<p>would be Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?”</p>",
        "<p>“Aye, aye,” returned Morgan; “I mind him; he owed me money, he did, and</p>\n<p>took my knife ashore with him.”</p>\n<p>“Speaking of knives,” said another, “why don’t we find his’n lying</p>\n<p>round? Flint warn’t the man to pick a seaman’s pocket; and the birds, I</p>\n<p>guess, would leave it be.”</p>\n<p>“By the powers, and that’s true!” cried Silver.</p>\n<p>“There ain’t a thing left here,” said Merry, still feeling round among</p>",
        "<p>the bones; “not a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don’t look nat’ral to</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>“No, by gum, it don’t,” agreed Silver; “not nat’ral, nor not nice, says</p>\n<p>you. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living, this would be a hot</p>\n<p>spot for you and me. Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what</p>\n<p>they are now.”</p>\n<p>“I saw him dead with these here deadlights,” said Morgan. “Billy took me</p>",
        "<p>in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.”</p>\n<p>“Dead--aye, sure enough he’s dead and gone below,” said the fellow with</p>\n<p>the bandage; “but if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint’s. Dear</p>\n<p>heart, but he died bad, did Flint!”</p>\n<p>“Aye, that he did,” observed another; “now he raged, and now he hollered</p>\n<p>for the rum, and now he sang. ‘Fifteen Men’ were his only song, mates;</p>\n<p>and I tell you true, I never rightly liked to hear it since. It was</p>",
        "<p>main hot, and the windy was open, and I hear that old song comin’ out as</p>\n<p>clear as clear--and the death-haul on the man already.”</p>\n<p>“Come, come,” said Silver; “stow this talk. He’s dead, and he don’t</p>\n<p>walk, that I know; leastways, he won’t walk by day, and you may lay to</p>\n<p>that. Care killed a cat. Fetch ahead for the doubloons.”</p>\n<p>We started, certainly; but in spite of the hot sun and the staring</p>\n<p>daylight, the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the</p>",
        "<p>wood, but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath. The terror of</p>\n<p>the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXXII: The Treasure-hunt--The Voice Among the Trees</h3>\n<p>Partly from the damping influence of this alarm, partly to rest Silver</p>\n<p>and the sick folk, the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained</p>\n<p>the brow of the ascent.</p>\n<p>The plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west, this spot on which</p>\n<p>we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand. Before us,</p>\n<p>over the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf;</p>",
        "<p>behind, we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton Island,</p>\n<p>but saw--clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands--a great field</p>\n<p>of open sea upon the east. Sheer above us rose the Spy-glass, here dotted</p>\n<p>with single pines, there black with precipices. There was no sound but</p>\n<p>that of the distant breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of</p>\n<p>countless insects in the brush. Not a man, not a sail, upon the sea; the</p>\n<p>very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude.</p>",
        "<p>Silver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass.</p>\n<p>“There are three ‘tall trees,’” said he, “about in the right line from</p>\n<p>Skeleton Island. ‘Spy-glass shoulder,’ I take it, means that lower p’int</p>\n<p>there. It’s child’s play to find the stuff now. I’ve half a mind to dine</p>\n<p>first.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel sharp,” growled Morgan. “Thinkin’ o’ Flint--I think it</p>\n<p>were--as done me.”</p>",
        "<p>“Ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he’s dead,” said Silver.</p>\n<p>“He were an ugly devil,” cried a third pirate with a shudder; “that blue</p>\n<p>in the face too!”</p>\n<p>“That was how the rum took him,” added Merry. “Blue! Well, I reckon he</p>\n<p>was blue. That’s a true word.”</p>\n<p>Ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of</p>\n<p>thought, they had spoken lower and lower, and they had almost got to</p>",
        "<p>whispering by now, so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted</p>\n<p>the silence of the wood. All of a sudden, out of the middle of the trees</p>\n<p>in front of us, a thin, high, trembling voice struck up the well-known</p>\n<p>air and words:</p>\n<p>“Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest--</p>\n<p>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”</p>\n<p>I never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates. The</p>",
        "<p>colour went from their six faces like enchantment; some leaped to their</p>\n<p>feet, some clawed hold of others; Morgan grovelled on the ground.</p>\n<p>“It’s Flint, by ----!” cried Merry.</p>\n<p>The song had stopped as suddenly as it began--broken off, you would have</p>\n<p>said, in the middle of a note, as though someone had laid his hand upon</p>\n<p>the singer’s mouth. Coming through the clear, sunny atmosphere among the</p>\n<p>green tree-tops, I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly; and the</p>",
        "<p>effect on my companions was the stranger.</p>\n<p>“Come,” said Silver, struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out;</p>\n<p>“this won’t do. Stand by to go about. This is a rum start, and I can’t</p>\n<p>name the voice, but it’s someone skylarking--someone that’s flesh and</p>\n<p>blood, and you may lay to that.”</p>\n<p>His courage had come back as he spoke, and some of the colour to his</p>\n<p>face along with it. Already the others had begun to lend an ear to this</p>",
        "<p>encouragement and were coming a little to themselves, when the same</p>\n<p>voice broke out again--not this time singing, but in a faint distant</p>\n<p>hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the Spy-glass.</p>\n<p>“Darby M’Graw,” it wailed--for that is the word that best describes the</p>\n<p>sound--“Darby M’Graw! Darby M’Graw!” again and again and again; and then</p>\n<p>rising a little higher, and with an oath that I leave out: “Fetch aft</p>\n<p>the rum, Darby!”</p>",
        "<p>The buccaneers remained rooted to the ground, their eyes starting from</p>\n<p>their heads. Long after the voice had died away they still stared in</p>\n<p>silence, dreadfully, before them.</p>\n<p>“That fixes it!” gasped one. “Let’s go.”</p>\n<p>“They was his last words,” moaned Morgan, “his last words above board.”</p>\n<p>Dick had his Bible out and was praying volubly. He had been well brought</p>\n<p>up, had Dick, before he came to sea and fell among bad companions.</p>",
        "<p>Still Silver was unconquered. I could hear his teeth rattle in his head,</p>\n<p>but he had not yet surrendered.</p>\n<p>“Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby,” he muttered; “not one</p>\n<p>but us that’s here.” And then, making a great effort: “Shipmates,”</p>\n<p>he cried, “I’m here to get that stuff, and I’ll not be beat by man or</p>\n<p>devil. I never was feared of Flint in his life, and, by the powers, I’ll</p>\n<p>face him dead. There’s seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a</p>",
        "<p>mile from here. When did ever a gentleman o’ fortune show his stern to</p>\n<p>that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug--and him dead</p>\n<p>too?”</p>\n<p>But there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers, rather,</p>\n<p>indeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his words.</p>\n<p>“Belay there, John!” said Merry. “Don’t you cross a sperrit.”</p>\n<p>And the rest were all too terrified to reply. They would have run away</p>",
        "<p>severally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and kept them</p>\n<p>close by John, as if his daring helped them. He, on his part, had pretty</p>\n<p>well fought his weakness down.</p>\n<p>“Sperrit? Well, maybe,” he said. “But there’s one thing not clear to me.</p>\n<p>There was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well</p>\n<p>then, what’s he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That</p>\n<p>ain’t in natur’, surely?”</p>",
        "<p>This argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell what will</p>\n<p>affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly</p>\n<p>relieved.</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s so,” he said. “You’ve a head upon your shoulders, John,</p>\n<p>and no mistake. ’Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I</p>\n<p>do believe. And come to think on it, it was like Flint’s voice, I</p>\n<p>grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker</p>",
        "<p>somebody else’s voice now--it was liker--”</p>\n<p>“By the powers, Ben Gunn!” roared Silver.</p>\n<p>“Aye, and so it were,” cried Morgan, springing on his knees. “Ben Gunn</p>\n<p>it were!”</p>\n<p>“It don’t make much odds, do it, now?” asked Dick. “Ben Gunn’s not here</p>\n<p>in the body any more’n Flint.”</p>\n<p>But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn.</p>",
        "<p>“Why, nobody minds Ben Gunn,” cried Merry; “dead or alive, nobody minds</p>\n<p>him.”</p>\n<p>It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural</p>\n<p>colour had revived in their faces. Soon they were chatting together,</p>\n<p>with intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing no further</p>\n<p>sound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, Merry walking</p>\n<p>first with Silver’s compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton</p>",
        "<p>Island. He had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn.</p>\n<p>Dick alone still held his Bible, and looked around him as he went, with</p>\n<p>fearful glances; but he found no sympathy, and Silver even joked him on</p>\n<p>his precautions.</p>\n<p>“I told you,” said he--“I told you you had sp’iled your Bible. If it</p>\n<p>ain’t no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for</p>\n<p>it? Not that!” and he snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his</p>",
        "<p>crutch.</p>\n<p>But Dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to me that</p>\n<p>the lad was falling sick; hastened by heat, exhaustion, and the shock</p>\n<p>of his alarm, the fever, predicted by Dr. Livesey, was evidently growing</p>\n<p>swiftly higher.</p>\n<p>It was fine open walking here, upon the summit; our way lay a little</p>\n<p>downhill, for, as I have said, the plateau tilted towards the west. The</p>",
        "<p>pines, great and small, grew wide apart; and even between the clumps of</p>\n<p>nutmeg and azalea, wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine. Striking,</p>\n<p>as we did, pretty near north-west across the island, we drew, on the</p>\n<p>one hand, ever nearer under the shoulders of the Spy-glass, and on the</p>\n<p>other, looked ever wider over that western bay where I had once tossed</p>\n<p>and trembled in the coracle.</p>\n<p>The first of the tall trees was reached, and by the bearings proved the</p>",
        "<p>wrong one. So with the second. The third rose nearly two hundred feet</p>\n<p>into the air above a clump of underwood--a giant of a vegetable, with</p>\n<p>a red column as big as a cottage, and a wide shadow around in which a</p>\n<p>company could have manoeuvred. It was conspicuous far to sea both on</p>\n<p>the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the</p>\n<p>chart.</p>\n<p>But it was not its size that now impressed my companions; it was the</p>",
        "<p>knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere</p>\n<p>buried below its spreading shadow. The thought of the money, as they</p>\n<p>drew nearer, swallowed up their previous terrors. Their eyes burned in</p>\n<p>their heads; their feet grew speedier and lighter; their whole soul</p>\n<p>was bound up in that fortune, that whole lifetime of extravagance and</p>\n<p>pleasure, that lay waiting there for each of them.</p>\n<p>Silver hobbled, grunting, on his crutch; his nostrils stood out and</p>",
        "<p>quivered; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and</p>\n<p>shiny countenance; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to</p>\n<p>him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look.</p>\n<p>Certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts, and certainly I read</p>\n<p>them like print. In the immediate nearness of the gold, all else had</p>\n<p>been forgotten: his promise and the doctor’s warning were both things</p>\n<p>of the past, and I could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the</p>",
        "<p>treasure, find and board the HISPANIOLA under cover of night, cut</p>\n<p>every honest throat about that island, and sail away as he had at first</p>\n<p>intended, laden with crimes and riches.</p>\n<p>Shaken as I was with these alarms, it was hard for me to keep up with</p>\n<p>the rapid pace of the treasure-hunters. Now and again I stumbled, and it</p>\n<p>was then that Silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me</p>\n<p>his murderous glances. Dick, who had dropped behind us and now brought</p>",
        "<p>up the rear, was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his</p>\n<p>fever kept rising. This also added to my wretchedness, and to crown all,</p>\n<p>I was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted</p>\n<p>on that plateau, when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face--he who</p>\n<p>died at Savannah, singing and shouting for drink--had there, with his</p>\n<p>own hand, cut down his six accomplices. This grove that was now so</p>\n<p>peaceful must then have rung with cries, I thought; and even with the</p>",
        "<p>thought I could believe I heard it ringing still.</p>\n<p>We were now at the margin of the thicket.</p>\n<p>“Huzza, mates, all together!” shouted Merry; and the foremost broke into</p>\n<p>a run.</p>\n<p>And suddenly, not ten yards further, we beheld them stop. A low cry</p>\n<p>arose. Silver doubled his pace, digging away with the foot of his crutch</p>\n<p>like one possessed; and next moment he and I had come also to a dead</p>",
        "<p>halt.</p>\n<p>Before us was a great excavation, not very recent, for the sides had</p>\n<p>fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom. In this were the shaft</p>\n<p>of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing-cases strewn</p>\n<p>around. On one of these boards I saw, branded with a hot iron, the name</p>\n<p>WALRUS--the name of Flint’s ship.</p>\n<p>All was clear to probation. The CACHE had been found and rifled; the</p>",
        "<p>seven hundred thousand pounds were gone!</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXXIII: The Fall of a Chieftain</h3>\n<p>There never was such an overturn in this world. Each of these six men</p>\n<p>was as though he had been struck. But with Silver the blow passed almost</p>\n<p>instantly. Every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch, like a</p>\n<p>racer, on that money; well, he was brought up, in a single second, dead;</p>\n<p>and he kept his head, found his temper, and changed his plan before the</p>\n<p>others had had time to realize the disappointment.</p>",
        "<p>“Jim,” he whispered, “take that, and stand by for trouble.”</p>\n<p>And he passed me a double-barrelled pistol.</p>\n<p>At the same time, he began quietly moving northward, and in a few steps</p>\n<p>had put the hollow between us two and the other five. Then he looked at</p>\n<p>me and nodded, as much as to say, “Here is a narrow corner,” as, indeed,</p>\n<p>I thought it was. His looks were not quite friendly, and I was so</p>\n<p>revolted at these constant changes that I could not forbear whispering,</p>",
        "<p>“So you’ve changed sides again.”</p>\n<p>There was no time left for him to answer in. The buccaneers, with oaths</p>\n<p>and cries, began to leap, one after another, into the pit and to dig</p>\n<p>with their fingers, throwing the boards aside as they did so. Morgan</p>\n<p>found a piece of gold. He held it up with a perfect spout of oaths. It</p>\n<p>was a two-guinea piece, and it went from hand to hand among them for a</p>\n<p>quarter of a minute.</p>",
        "<p>“Two guineas!” roared Merry, shaking it at Silver. “That’s your seven</p>\n<p>hundred thousand pounds, is it? You’re the man for bargains, ain’t you?</p>\n<p>You’re him that never bungled nothing, you wooden-headed lubber!”</p>\n<p>“Dig away, boys,” said Silver with the coolest insolence; “you’ll find</p>\n<p>some pig-nuts and I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>\n<p>“Pig-nuts!” repeated Merry, in a scream. “Mates, do you hear that? I</p>\n<p>tell you now, that man there knew it all along. Look in the face of him</p>",
        "<p>and you’ll see it wrote there.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, Merry,” remarked Silver, “standing for cap’n again? You’re a</p>\n<p>pushing lad, to be sure.”</p>\n<p>But this time everyone was entirely in Merry’s favour. They began to</p>\n<p>scramble out of the excavation, darting furious glances behind them. One</p>\n<p>thing I observed, which looked well for us: they all got out upon the</p>\n<p>opposite side from Silver.</p>",
        "<p>Well, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other, the pit</p>\n<p>between us, and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow.</p>\n<p>Silver never moved; he watched them, very upright on his crutch, and</p>\n<p>looked as cool as ever I saw him. He was brave, and no mistake.</p>\n<p>At last Merry seemed to think a speech might help matters.</p>\n<p>“Mates,” says he, “there’s two of them alone there; one’s the old</p>\n<p>cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this; the</p>",
        "<p>other’s that cub that I mean to have the heart of. Now, mates--”</p>\n<p>He was raising his arm and his voice, and plainly meant to lead a</p>\n<p>charge. But just then--crack! crack! crack!--three musket-shots flashed</p>\n<p>out of the thicket. Merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation; the</p>\n<p>man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length</p>\n<p>upon his side, where he lay dead, but still twitching; and the other</p>\n<p>three turned and ran for it with all their might.</p>",
        "<p>Before you could wink, Long John had fired two barrels of a pistol into</p>\n<p>the struggling Merry, and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the</p>\n<p>last agony, “George,” said he, “I reckon I settled you.”</p>\n<p>At the same moment, the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn joined us, with</p>\n<p>smoking muskets, from among the nutmeg-trees.</p>\n<p>“Forward!” cried the doctor. “Double quick, my lads. We must head ’em</p>\n<p>off the boats.”</p>",
        "<p>And we set off at a great pace, sometimes plunging through the bushes to</p>\n<p>the chest.</p>\n<p>I tell you, but Silver was anxious to keep up with us. The work that man</p>\n<p>went through, leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were</p>\n<p>fit to burst, was work no sound man ever equalled; and so thinks the</p>\n<p>doctor. As it was, he was already thirty yards behind us and on the</p>\n<p>verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope.</p>",
        "<p>“Doctor,” he hailed, “see there! No hurry!”</p>\n<p>Sure enough there was no hurry. In a more open part of the plateau, we</p>\n<p>could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as</p>\n<p>they had started, right for Mizzenmast Hill. We were already between</p>\n<p>them and the boats; and so we four sat down to breathe, while Long John,</p>\n<p>mopping his face, came slowly up with us.</p>\n<p>“Thank ye kindly, doctor,” says he. “You came in in about the nick, I</p>",
        "<p>guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it’s you, Ben Gunn!” he added. “Well,</p>\n<p>you’re a nice one, to be sure.”</p>\n<p>“I’m Ben Gunn, I am,” replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his</p>\n<p>embarrassment. “And,” he added, after a long pause, “how do, Mr. Silver?</p>\n<p>Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.”</p>\n<p>“Ben, Ben,” murmured Silver, “to think as you’ve done me!”</p>\n<p>The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their</p>",
        "<p>flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to</p>\n<p>where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place.</p>\n<p>It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the</p>\n<p>half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end.</p>\n<p>Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the</p>\n<p>skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he</p>\n<p>had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the</p>",
        "<p>excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from</p>\n<p>the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at</p>\n<p>the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in</p>\n<p>safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA.</p>\n<p>When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the</p>\n<p>attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone</p>\n<p>to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the</p>",
        "<p>stores, for Ben Gunn’s cave was well supplied with goats’ meat salted</p>\n<p>by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in</p>\n<p>safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of</p>\n<p>malaria and keep a guard upon the money.</p>\n<p>“As for you, Jim,” he said, “it went against my heart, but I did what I</p>\n<p>thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not</p>\n<p>one of these, whose fault was it?”</p>",
        "<p>That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid</p>\n<p>disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way</p>\n<p>to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray</p>\n<p>and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be</p>\n<p>at hand beside the pine. Soon, however, he saw that our party had the</p>\n<p>start of him; and Ben Gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in</p>\n<p>front to do his best alone. Then it had occurred to him to work upon the</p>",
        "<p>superstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that</p>\n<p>Gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the</p>\n<p>arrival of the treasure-hunters.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said Silver, “it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here.</p>\n<p>You would have let old John be cut to bits, and never given it a</p>\n<p>thought, doctor.”</p>\n<p>“Not a thought,” replied Dr. Livesey cheerily.</p>",
        "<p>And by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick-axe,</p>\n<p>demolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out</p>\n<p>to go round by sea for North Inlet.</p>\n<p>This was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he was almost</p>\n<p>killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and</p>\n<p>we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea. Soon we passed out</p>\n<p>of the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island, round</p>",
        "<p>which, four days ago, we had towed the HISPANIOLA.</p>\n<p>As we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth of Ben</p>\n<p>Gunn’s cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a musket. It was the</p>\n<p>squire, and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers, in which</p>\n<p>the voice of Silver joined as heartily as any.</p>\n<p>Three miles farther, just inside the mouth of North Inlet, what should</p>\n<p>we meet but the HISPANIOLA, cruising by herself? The last flood had</p>",
        "<p>lifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide current, as</p>\n<p>in the southern anchorage, we should never have found her more, or found</p>\n<p>her stranded beyond help. As it was, there was little amiss beyond the</p>\n<p>wreck of the main-sail. Another anchor was got ready and dropped in a</p>\n<p>fathom and a half of water. We all pulled round again to Rum Cove,</p>\n<p>the nearest point for Ben Gunn’s treasure-house; and then Gray,</p>\n<p>single-handed, returned with the gig to the HISPANIOLA, where he was to</p>",
        "<p>pass the night on guard.</p>\n<p>A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. At the</p>\n<p>top, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing</p>\n<p>of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. At Silver’s polite</p>\n<p>salute he somewhat flushed.</p>\n<p>“John Silver,” he said, “you’re a prodigious villain and imposter--a</p>\n<p>monstrous imposter, sir. I am told I am not to prosecute you. Well,</p>",
        "<p>then, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like</p>\n<p>mill-stones.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you kindly, sir,” replied Long John, again saluting.</p>\n<p>“I dare you to thank me!” cried the squire. “It is a gross dereliction</p>\n<p>of my duty. Stand back.”</p>\n<p>And thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy place, with</p>\n<p>a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. The</p>",
        "<p>floor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far</p>\n<p>corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps</p>\n<p>of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. That was Flint’s</p>\n<p>treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the</p>\n<p>lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA. How many it had cost in the</p>\n<p>amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep,</p>\n<p>what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what</p>",
        "<p>shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there</p>\n<p>were still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben</p>\n<p>Gunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in</p>\n<p>vain to share in the reward.</p>\n<p>“Come in, Jim,” said the captain. “You’re a good boy in your line, Jim,</p>\n<p>but I don’t think you and me’ll go to sea again. You’re too much of the</p>\n<p>born favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here,</p>",
        "<p>man?”</p>\n<p>“Come back to my dooty, sir,” returned Silver.</p>\n<p>“Ah!” said the captain, and that was all he said.</p>\n<p>What a supper I had of it that night, with all my friends around me; and</p>\n<p>what a meal it was, with Ben Gunn’s salted goat and some delicacies and</p>\n<p>a bottle of old wine from the HISPANIOLA. Never, I am sure, were people</p>\n<p>gayer or happier. And there was Silver, sitting back almost out of the</p>",
        "<p>firelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward when anything</p>\n<p>was wanted, even joining quietly in our laughter--the same bland,</p>\n<p>polite, obsequious seaman of the voyage out.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XXXIV: And Last</h3>\n<p>The next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this</p>\n<p>great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three</p>\n<p>miles by boat to the HISPANIOLA, was a considerable task for so small</p>\n<p>a number of workmen. The three fellows still abroad upon the island did</p>\n<p>not greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was</p>\n<p>sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought,</p>",
        "<p>besides, they had had more than enough of fighting.</p>\n<p>Therefore the work was pushed on briskly. Gray and Ben Gunn came and</p>\n<p>went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure</p>\n<p>on the beach. Two of the bars, slung in a rope’s end, made a good load</p>\n<p>for a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with. For my part,</p>\n<p>as I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy all day in the cave</p>\n<p>packing the minted money into bread-bags.</p>",
        "<p>It was a strange collection, like Billy Bones’s hoard for the diversity</p>\n<p>of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I</p>\n<p>never had more pleasure than in sorting them. English, French, Spanish,</p>\n<p>Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and</p>\n<p>moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the</p>\n<p>last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked</p>\n<p>like wisps of string or bits of spider’s web, round pieces and square</p>",
        "<p>pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round</p>\n<p>your neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think,</p>\n<p>have found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they</p>\n<p>were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my</p>\n<p>fingers with sorting them out.</p>\n<p>Day after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been</p>\n<p>stowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and</p>",
        "<p>all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers.</p>\n<p>At last--I think it was on the third night--the doctor and I were</p>\n<p>strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of</p>\n<p>the isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us</p>\n<p>a noise between shrieking and singing. It was only a snatch that reached</p>\n<p>our ears, followed by the former silence.</p>\n<p>“Heaven forgive them,” said the doctor; “’tis the mutineers!”</p>",
        "<p>“All drunk, sir,” struck in the voice of Silver from behind us.</p>\n<p>Silver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of</p>\n<p>daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged</p>\n<p>and friendly dependent. Indeed, it was remarkable how well he bore</p>\n<p>these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to</p>\n<p>ingratiate himself with all. Yet, I think, none treated him better than</p>\n<p>a dog, unless it was Ben Gunn, who was still terribly afraid of his old</p>",
        "<p>quartermaster, or myself, who had really something to thank him for;</p>\n<p>although for that matter, I suppose, I had reason to think even worse of</p>\n<p>him than anybody else, for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery</p>\n<p>upon the plateau. Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor</p>\n<p>answered him.</p>\n<p>“Drunk or raving,” said he.</p>\n<p>“Right you were, sir,” replied Silver; “and precious little odds which,</p>",
        "<p>to you and me.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man,” returned</p>\n<p>the doctor with a sneer, “and so my feelings may surprise you, Master</p>\n<p>Silver. But if I were sure they were raving--as I am morally certain</p>\n<p>one, at least, of them is down with fever--I should leave this camp,</p>\n<p>and at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them the assistance of my</p>\n<p>skill.”</p>",
        "<p>“Ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong,” quoth Silver. “You</p>\n<p>would lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. I’m on your side</p>\n<p>now, hand and glove; and I shouldn’t wish for to see the party weakened,</p>\n<p>let alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you. But these men down</p>\n<p>there, they couldn’t keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to;</p>\n<p>and what’s more, they couldn’t believe as you could.”</p>\n<p>“No,” said the doctor. “You’re the man to keep your word, we know that.”</p>",
        "<p>Well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. Only</p>\n<p>once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting.</p>\n<p>A council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the</p>\n<p>island--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong</p>\n<p>approval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk</p>\n<p>of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools,</p>\n<p>clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular</p>",
        "<p>desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco.</p>\n<p>That was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the</p>\n<p>treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the</p>\n<p>goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we</p>\n<p>weighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out</p>\n<p>of North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and</p>\n<p>fought under at the palisade.</p>",
        "<p>The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for,</p>\n<p>as we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to</p>\n<p>lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of</p>\n<p>them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in</p>\n<p>supplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that</p>\n<p>wretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them</p>\n<p>home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness. The doctor</p>",
        "<p>hailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were</p>\n<p>to find them. But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us,</p>\n<p>for God’s sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a</p>\n<p>place.</p>\n<p>At last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly</p>\n<p>drawing out of earshot, one of them--I know not which it was--leapt to</p>\n<p>his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent</p>",
        "<p>a shot whistling over Silver’s head and through the main-sail.</p>\n<p>After that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked</p>\n<p>out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost</p>\n<p>melted out of sight in the growing distance. That was, at least, the end</p>\n<p>of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of</p>\n<p>Treasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea.</p>\n<p>We were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only</p>",
        "<p>the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for</p>\n<p>though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet. We laid her</p>\n<p>head for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the</p>\n<p>voyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds</p>\n<p>and a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it.</p>\n<p>It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful</p>\n<p>land-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full</p>",
        "<p>of Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and</p>\n<p>vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money. The sight of so many</p>\n<p>good-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical</p>\n<p>fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a</p>\n<p>most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island;</p>\n<p>and the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore</p>\n<p>to pass the early part of the night. Here they met the captain of an</p>",
        "<p>English man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and,</p>\n<p>in short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came</p>\n<p>alongside the HISPANIOLA.</p>\n<p>Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began,</p>\n<p>with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver was gone.</p>\n<p>The maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago,</p>\n<p>and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which</p>",
        "<p>would certainly have been forfeit if “that man with the one leg</p>\n<p>had stayed aboard.” But this was not all. The sea-cook had not gone</p>\n<p>empty-handed. He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed</p>\n<p>one of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas,</p>\n<p>to help him on his further wanderings.</p>\n<p>I think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him.</p>\n<p>Well, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a</p>",
        "<p>good cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly</p>\n<p>was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five men only of</p>\n<p>those who had sailed returned with her. “Drink and the devil had done</p>\n<p>for the rest,” with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite</p>\n<p>in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about:</p>\n<p>With one man of her crew alive,</p>\n<p>What put to sea with seventy-five.</p>",
        "<p>All of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or</p>\n<p>foolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now retired</p>\n<p>from the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit</p>\n<p>with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now</p>\n<p>mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the</p>\n<p>father of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he</p>\n<p>spent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for</p>",
        "<p>he was back begging on the twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep,</p>\n<p>exactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great</p>\n<p>favourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a</p>\n<p>notable singer in church on Sundays and saints’ days.</p>\n<p>Of Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man with one</p>\n<p>leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say he met his old</p>\n<p>Negress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint.</p>",
        "<p>It is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another</p>\n<p>world are very small.</p>\n<p>The bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know, where</p>\n<p>Flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me. Oxen and</p>\n<p>wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island; and</p>\n<p>the worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the surf booming about</p>\n<p>its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint</p>",
        "<p>still ringing in my ears: “Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”</p>"
