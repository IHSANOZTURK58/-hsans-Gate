        "<h3>_TO MY DEAR LITTLE MAY_</h3>\n<h3>PREFACE</h3>\n<p>Who says that English folk have no fairy-tales of their own?</p>\n<p>The present</p>\n<p>volume contains only a selection out of some 140, of which I have found</p>\n<p>traces in this country.</p>\n<p>It is probable that many more exist.</p>\n",
        "<p>A quarter of the tales in this volume, have been collected during the</p>\n<p>last ten years or so, and some of them have not been hitherto published.</p>\n<p>Up to 1870 it was equally said of France and of Italy, that they</p>\n<p>possessed no folk-tales.</p>\n<p>Yet, within fifteen years from that date, over</p>\n<p>1000 tales had been collected in each country.</p>\n<p>I am hoping that the</p>\n",
        "<p>present volume may lead to equal activity in this country, and would</p>\n<p>earnestly beg any reader of this book who knows of similar tales, to</p>\n<p>communicate them, written down as they are told, to me, care of Mr.</p>\n<p>Nutt.</p>\n<p>The only reason, I imagine, why such tales have not hitherto</p>\n<p>been brought to light, is the lamentable gap between the governing and</p>\n<p>recording classes and the dumb working classes of this country--dumb to</p>\n",
        "<p>others but eloquent among themselves.</p>\n<p>It would be no unpatriotic task</p>\n<p>to help to bridge over this gulf, by giving a common fund of nursery</p>\n<p>literature to all classes of the English people, and, in any case, it</p>\n<p>can do no harm to add to the innocent gaiety of the nation.</p>\n<p>A word or two as to our title seems necessary.</p>\n<p>We have called our</p>\n",
        "<p>stories Fairy Tales though few of them speak of fairies.</p>\n<p>[Footnote: For</p>\n<p>some recent views on fairies and tales _about_ fairies, see Notes.] The</p>\n<p>same remark applies to the collection of the Brothers Grimm and to all</p>\n<p>the other European collections, which contain exactly the same classes</p>\n<p>of tales as ours.</p>\n<p>Yet our stories are what the little ones mean when</p>\n",
        "<p>they clamour for “Fairy Tales,” and this is the only name which they</p>\n<p>give to them.</p>\n<p>One cannot imagine a child saying, “Tell us a folk-tale,</p>\n<p>nurse,” or “Another nursery tale, please, grandma.” As our book is</p>\n<p>intended for the little ones, we have indicated its contents by the name</p>\n<p>they use.</p>\n<p>The words “Fairy Tales” must accordingly be taken to</p>\n",
        "<p>include tales in which occurs something “fairy,” something</p>\n<p>extraordinary--fairies, giants, dwarfs, speaking animals.</p>\n<p>It must</p>\n<p>be taken also to cover tales in which what is extraordinary is the</p>\n<p>stupidity of some of the actors.</p>\n<p>Many of the tales in this volume, as</p>\n<p>in similar collections for other European countries, are what the</p>\n",
        "<p>folklorists call Drolls.</p>\n<p>They serve to justify the title of Merrie</p>\n<p>England, which used to be given to this country of ours, and indicate</p>\n<p>unsuspected capacity for fun and humour among the unlettered classes.</p>\n<p>The story of Tom Tit Tot, which opens our collection, is unequalled</p>\n<p>among all other folk-tales I am acquainted with, for its combined sense</p>\n<p>of humour and dramatic power.</p>\n",
        "<p>The first adjective of our title also needs a similar extension of its</p>\n<p>meaning.</p>\n<p>I have acted on Molière's principle, and have taken what was</p>\n<p>good wherever I could find it.</p>\n<p>Thus, a couple of these stories have been</p>\n<p>found among descendants of English immigrants in America; a couple of</p>\n<p>others I tell as I heard them myself in my youth in Australia.</p>\n",
        "<p>One of</p>\n<p>the best was taken down from the mouth of an English Gipsy.</p>\n<p>I have also</p>\n<p>included some stories that have only been found in Lowland Scotch.</p>\n<p>I have felt justified in doing this, as of the twenty-one folk-tales</p>\n<p>contained in Chambers' “Popular Rhymes of Scotland,” no less than</p>\n<p>sixteen are also to be found in an English form.</p>\n",
        "<p>With the Folk-tale as</p>\n<p>with the Ballad, Lowland Scotch may be regarded as simply a dialect</p>\n<p>of English, and it is a mere chance whether a tale is extant in one or</p>\n<p>other, or both.</p>\n<p>I have also rescued and re-told a few Fairy Tales that only exist</p>\n<p>now-a-days in the form of ballads.</p>\n<p>There are certain indications that</p>\n",
        "<p>the “common form” of the English Fairy Tale was the _cante-fable_, a</p>\n<p>mixture of narrative and verse of which the most illustrious example in</p>\n<p>literature is “Aucassin et Nicolette.” In one case I have endeavoured to</p>\n<p>retain this form, as the tale in which it occurs, “Childe Rowland,”</p>\n<p>is mentioned by Shakespeare in _King Lear_, and is probably, as I have</p>\n<p>shown, the source of Milton's _Comus_.</p>\n<p>Late as they have been collected,</p>\n",
        "<p>some dozen of the tales can be traced back to the sixteenth century, two</p>\n<p>of them being quoted by Shakespeare himself.</p>\n<p>In the majority of instances I have had largely to rewrite these Fairy</p>\n<p>Tales, especially those in dialect, including the Lowland Scotch.</p>\n<p>[Footnote: It is perhaps worth remarking that the Brothers Grimm did the</p>\n<p>same with their stories.</p>\n<p>“Dass der Ausdruck,” say they in their Preface,</p>\n",
        "<p>“und die Ausführung des Einzelnen grossentheils von uns herrührt,</p>\n<p>versteht sich von selbst.” I may add that many of their stories</p>\n<p>were taken from printed sources.</p>\n<p>In the first volume of Mrs.</p>\n<p>Hunt's</p>\n<p>translation, Nos.</p>\n<p>12, 18, 19, 23, 32, 35, 42, 43, 44, 69, 77, 78, 83,</p>\n",
        "<p>89, are thus derived.] Children, and sometimes those of larger</p>\n<p>growth, will not read dialect.</p>\n<p>I have also had to reduce the flatulent</p>\n<p>phraseology of the eighteenth-century chap-books, and to re-write in</p>\n<p>simpler style the stories only extant in “Literary” English.</p>\n<p>I have,</p>\n<p>however, left a few vulgarisms in the mouths of vulgar people.</p>\n",
        "<p>Children</p>\n<p>appreciate the dramatic propriety of this as much as their elders.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse</p>\n<p>will speak when she tells Fairy Tales.</p>\n<p>I am doubtful as to my success in</p>\n<p>catching the colloquial-romantic tone appropriate for such narratives,</p>\n<p>but the thing had to be done or else my main object, to give a book of</p>\n",
        "<p>English Fairy Tales which English children will listen to, would have</p>\n<p>been unachieved.</p>\n<p>This book is meant to be read aloud, and not merely</p>\n<p>taken in by the eye.</p>\n<p>In a few instances I have introduced or changed an incident.</p>\n<p>I have</p>\n<p>never done so, however, without mentioning the fact in the Notes.</p>\n",
        "<p>These</p>\n<p>have been relegated to the obscurity of small print and a back place,</p>\n<p>while the little ones have been, perhaps unnecessarily, warned off them.</p>\n<p>They indicate my sources and give a few references to parallels and</p>\n<p>variants which may be of interest to fellow-students of Folk-lore.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>is, perhaps, not necessary to inform readers who are not fellow-students</p>\n",
        "<p>that the study of Folk-tales has pretensions to be a science.</p>\n<p>It has its</p>\n<p>special terminology, and its own methods of investigation, by which it</p>\n<p>is hoped, one of these days, to gain fuller knowledge of the workings</p>\n<p>of the popular mind as well as traces of archaic modes of thought and</p>\n<p>custom.</p>\n<p>I hope on some future occasion to treat the subject of</p>\n",
        "<p>the English Folk-tale on a larger scale and with all the necessary</p>\n<p>paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus.</p>\n<p>I shall then, of course,</p>\n<p>reproduce my originals with literal accuracy, and have therefore felt</p>\n<p>the more at liberty on the present occasion to make the necessary</p>\n<p>deviations from this in order to make the tales readable for children.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have to thank those by whose kindness in waiving their rights</p>\n",
        "<p>to some of these stories, I have been enabled to compile this book.</p>\n<p>My</p>\n<p>friends Mr.</p>\n<p>E.</p>\n<p>Clodd, Mr.</p>\n<p>F.</p>\n<p>Hindes Groome, and Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Andrew Lang,</p>\n<p>have thus yielded up to me some of the most attractive stories in</p>\n<p>the following pages.</p>\n<p>The Councils of the English and of the American</p>\n<p>Folk-lore Societies, and Messrs.</p>\n<p>Longmans, have also been equally</p>\n<p>generous.</p>\n",
        "<p>Nor can I close these remarks without a word of thanks and</p>\n<p>praise to the artistic skill with which my friend, Mr.</p>\n<p>J.</p>\n<p>D.</p>\n<p>Batten, has</p>\n<p>made the romance and humour of these stories live again in the brilliant</p>\n<p>designs with which he has adorned these pages.</p>\n",

        "<p>“Darter,” says she, “put you them there pies on the shelf, and leave 'em</p>\n<p>there a little, and they'll come again.”--She meant, you know, the crust</p>\n<p>would get soft.</p>\n<p>But the girl, she says to herself: “Well, if they'll come again, I'll</p>\n<p>eat 'em now.” And she set to work and ate 'em all, first and last.</p>\n<p>Well, come supper-time the woman said: “Go you, and get one o' them</p>\n<p>there pies.</p>\n",
        "<p>I dare say they've come again now.”</p>\n<p>The girl went and she looked, and there was nothing but the dishes.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>back she came and says she: “Noo, they ain't come again.”</p>\n<p>“Not one of 'em?” says the mother.</p>\n<p>“Not one of 'em,” says she.</p>\n<p>“Well, come again, or not come again,” said the woman “I'll have one for</p>\n",
        "<p>supper.”</p>\n<p>“But you can't, if they ain't come,” said the girl.</p>\n<p>“But I can,” says she.</p>\n<p>“Go you, and bring the best of 'em.”</p>\n<p>“Best or worst,” says the girl, “I've ate 'em all, and you can't have</p>\n<p>one till that's come again.”</p>\n<p>Well, the woman she was done, and she took her spinning to the door to</p>\n",
        "<p>spin, and as she span she sang:</p>\n<p>“My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day.</p>\n<p>My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day.”</p>\n<p>The king was coming down the street, and he heard her sing, but what she</p>\n<p>sang he couldn't hear, so he stopped and said:</p>\n<p>“What was that you were singing, my good woman?”</p>\n<p>The woman was ashamed to let him hear what her daughter had been doing,</p>\n",
        "<p>so she sang, instead of that:</p>\n<p>“My darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day.</p>\n<p>My darter ha' spun five, five skeins to-day.”</p>\n<p>“Stars o' mine!” said the king, “I never heard tell of any one that</p>\n<p>could do that.”</p>\n<p>Then he said: “Look you here, I want a wife, and I'll marry your</p>\n<p>daughter.</p>\n",
        "<p>But look you here,” says he, “eleven months out of the year</p>\n<p>she shall have all she likes to eat, and all the gowns she likes to get,</p>\n<p>and all the company she likes to keep; but the last month of the year</p>\n<p>she'll have to spin five skeins every day, and if she don't I shall kill</p>\n<p>her.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” says the woman; for she thought what a grand marriage that</p>\n<p>was.</p>\n",
        "<p>And as for the five skeins, when the time came, there'd be plenty</p>\n<p>of ways of getting out of it, and likeliest, he'd have forgotten all</p>\n<p>about it.</p>\n<p>Well, so they were married.</p>\n<p>And for eleven months the girl had all she</p>\n<p>liked to eat, and all the gowns she liked to get, and all the company</p>\n<p>she liked to keep.</p>\n",
        "<p>But when the time was getting over, she began to think about the skeins</p>\n<p>and to wonder if he had 'em in mind.</p>\n<p>But not one word did he say about</p>\n<p>'em, and she thought he'd wholly forgotten 'em.</p>\n<p>However, the last day of the last month he takes her to a room she'd</p>\n<p>never set eyes on before.</p>\n<p>There was nothing in it but a spinning-wheel</p>\n",
        "<p>and a stool.</p>\n<p>And says he: “Now, my dear, here you'll be shut in</p>\n<p>to-morrow with some victuals and some flax, and if you haven't spun five</p>\n<p>skeins by the night, your head'll go off.”</p>\n<p>And away he went about his business.</p>\n<p>Well, she was that frightened, she'd always been such a gatless girl,</p>\n<p>that she didn't so much as know how to spin, and what was she to do</p>\n",
        "<p>to-morrow with no one to come nigh her to help her?</p>\n<p>She sat down on a</p>\n<p>stool in the kitchen, and law!</p>\n<p>how she did cry!</p>\n<p>However, all of a sudden she heard a sort of a knocking low down on the</p>\n<p>door.</p>\n<p>She upped and oped it, and what should she see but a small little</p>\n",
        "<p>black thing with a long tail.</p>\n<p>That looked up at her right curious, and</p>\n<p>that said:</p>\n<p>“What are you a-crying for?”</p>\n<p>“What's that to you?” says she.</p>\n<p>“Never you mind,” that said, “but tell me what you're a-crying for.”</p>\n<p>“That won't do me no good if I do,” says she.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You don't know that,” that said, and twirled that's tail round.</p>\n<p>“Well,” says she, “that won't do no harm, if that don't do no good,” and</p>\n<p>she upped and told about the pies, and the skeins, and everything.</p>\n<p>“This is what I'll do,” says the little black thing, “I'll come to your</p>\n<p>window every morning and take the flax and bring it spun at night.”</p>\n<p>“What's your pay?” says she.</p>\n<p>That looked out of the corner of that's eyes, and that said: “I'll</p>\n",
        "<p>give you three guesses every night to guess my name, and if you haven't</p>\n<p>guessed it before the month's up you shall be mine.”</p>\n<p>Well, she thought she'd be sure to guess that's name before the month</p>\n<p>was up.</p>\n<p>“All right,” says she, “I agree.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” that says, and law!</p>\n<p>how that twirled that's tail.</p>\n",
        "<p>Well, the next day, her husband took her into the room, and there was</p>\n<p>the flax and the day's food.</p>\n<p>“Now there's the flax,” says he, “and if that ain't spun up this night,</p>\n<p>off goes your head.” And then he went out and locked the door.</p>\n<p>He'd hardly gone, when there was a knocking against the window.</p>\n<p>She upped and she oped it, and there sure enough was the little old</p>\n<p>thing sitting on the ledge.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Where's the flax?” says he.</p>\n<p>“Here it be,” says she.</p>\n<p>And she gave it to him.</p>\n<p>Well, come the evening a knocking came again to the window.</p>\n<p>She upped</p>\n<p>and she oped it, and there was the little old thing with five skeins of</p>\n<p>flax on his arm.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Here it be,” says he, and he gave it to her.</p>\n<p>“Now, what's my name?” says he.</p>\n<p>“What, is that Bill?” says she.</p>\n<p>“Noo, that ain't,” says he, and he twirled his tail.</p>\n<p>“Is that Ned?” says she.</p>\n<p>“Noo, that ain't,” says he, and he twirled his tail.</p>\n<p>“Well, is that Mark?” says she.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Noo, that ain't,” says he, and he twirled his tail harder, and away he</p>\n<p>flew.</p>\n<p>Well, when her husband came in, there were the five skeins ready for</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>“I see I shan't have to kill you to-night, my dear,” says he;</p>\n<p>“you'll have your food and your flax in the morning,” says he, and away</p>\n<p>he goes.</p>\n",
        "<p>Well, every day the flax and the food were brought, and every day that</p>\n<p>there little black impet used to come mornings and evenings.</p>\n<p>And all the</p>\n<p>day the girl sat trying to think of names to say to it when it came at</p>\n<p>night.</p>\n<p>But she never hit on the right one.</p>\n<p>And as it got towards the</p>\n",
        "<p>end of the month, the impet began to look so maliceful, and that twirled</p>\n<p>that's tail faster and faster each time she gave a guess.</p>\n<p>At last it came to the last day but one.</p>\n<p>The impet came at night along</p>\n<p>with the five skeins, and that said,</p>\n<p>“What, ain't you got my name yet?”</p>\n<p>“Is that Nicodemus?” says she.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Noo, t'ain't,” that says.</p>\n<p>“Is that Sammle?” says she.</p>\n<p>“Noo, t'ain't,” that says.</p>\n<p>“A-well, is that Methusalem?” says she.</p>\n<p>“Noo, t'ain't that neither,” that says.</p>\n<p>Then that looks at her with that's eyes like a coal o' fire, and that</p>\n<p>says: “Woman, there's only to-morrow night, and then you'll be mine!”</p>\n",
        "<p>And away it flew.</p>\n<p>Well, she felt that horrid.</p>\n<p>However, she heard the king coming along the</p>\n<p>passage.</p>\n<p>In he came, and when he sees the five skeins, he says, says he,</p>\n<p>“Well, my dear,” says he, “I don't see but what you'll have your skeins</p>\n<p>ready to-morrow night as well, and as I reckon I shan't have to kill</p>\n",
        "<p>you, I'll have supper in here to-night.” So they brought supper, and</p>\n<p>another stool for him, and down the two sat.</p>\n<p>Well, he hadn't eaten but a mouthful or so, when he stops and begins to</p>\n<p>laugh.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” says she.</p>\n<p>“A-why,” says he, “I was out a-hunting to-day, and I got away to a place</p>\n<p>in the wood I'd never seen before And there was an old chalk-pit.</p>\n",
        "<p>And I</p>\n<p>heard a kind of a sort of a humming.</p>\n<p>So I got off my hobby, and I went</p>\n<p>right quiet to the pit, and I looked down.</p>\n<p>Well, what should there be</p>\n<p>but the funniest little black thing you ever set eyes on.</p>\n<p>And what was</p>\n",
        "<p>that doing, but that had a little spinning-wheel, and that was spinning</p>\n<p>wonderful fast, and twirling that's tail.</p>\n<p>And as that span that sang:</p>\n<p>“Nimmy nimmy not</p>\n<p>My name's Tom Tit Tot.”</p>\n<p>Well, when the girl heard this, she felt as if she could have jumped out</p>\n<p>of her skin for joy, but she didn't say a word.</p>\n",
        "<p>Next day that there little thing looked so maliceful when he came for</p>\n<p>the flax.</p>\n<p>And when night came, she heard that knocking against the</p>\n<p>window panes.</p>\n<p>She oped the window, and that come right in on the ledge.</p>\n<p>That was grinning from ear to ear, and Oo!</p>\n<p>that's tail was twirling</p>\n",
        "<p>round so fast.</p>\n<p>“What's my name?” that says, as that gave her the skeins.</p>\n<p>“Is that Solomon?” she says, pretending to be afeard.</p>\n<p>“Noo, t'ain't,” that says, and that came further into the room.</p>\n<p>“Well, is that Zebedee?” says she again.</p>\n<p>“Noo, t'ain't,” says the impet.</p>\n<p>And then that laughed and twirled that's</p>\n",

        "<p>into the dark, and she never saw it any more.</p>\n<h3>THE THREE SILLIES</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time there was a farmer and his wife who had one daughter,</p>\n<p>and she was courted by a gentleman.</p>\n<p>Every evening he used to come and</p>\n<p>see her, and stop to supper at the farmhouse, and the daughter used to</p>\n<p>be sent down into the cellar to draw the beer for supper.</p>\n",
        "<p>So one evening</p>\n<p>she had gone down to draw the beer, and she happened to look up at the</p>\n<p>ceiling while she was drawing, and she saw a mallet stuck in one of the</p>\n<p>beams.</p>\n<p>It must have been there a long, long time, but somehow or other</p>\n<p>she had never noticed it before, and she began a-thinking.</p>\n<p>And she</p>\n",
        "<p>thought it was very dangerous to have that mallet there, for she said</p>\n<p>to herself: “Suppose him and me was to be married, and we was to have a</p>\n<p>son, and he was to grow up to be a man, and come down into the cellar to</p>\n<p>draw the beer, like as I'm doing now, and the mallet was to fall on his</p>\n<p>head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!” And she put down</p>\n<p>the candle and the jug, and sat herself down and began a-crying.</p>\n<p>Well, they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long</p>\n",
        "<p>drawing the beer, and her mother went down to see after her, and she</p>\n<p>found her sitting on the settle crying, and the beer running over the</p>\n<p>floor.</p>\n<p>“Why, whatever is the matter?” said her mother.</p>\n<p>“Oh, mother!”</p>\n<p>says she, “look at that horrid mallet!</p>\n<p>Suppose we was to be married, and</p>\n",
        "<p>was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down to the</p>\n<p>cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill</p>\n<p>him, what a dreadful thing it would be!” “Dear, dear!</p>\n<p>what a dreadful</p>\n<p>thing it would be!” said the mother, and she sat her down aside of the</p>\n<p>daughter and started a-crying too.</p>\n<p>Then after a bit the father began to</p>\n",
        "<p>wonder that they didn't come back, and he went down into the cellar to</p>\n<p>look after them himself, and there they two sat a-crying, and the beer</p>\n<p>running all over the floor.</p>\n<p>“Whatever is the matter?” says he.</p>\n<p>“Why,”</p>\n<p>says the mother, “look at that horrid mallet.</p>\n<p>Just suppose, if our</p>\n",
        "<p>daughter and her sweetheart was to be married, and was to have a son,</p>\n<p>and he was to grow up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw</p>\n<p>the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him, what a</p>\n<p>dreadful thing it would be!” “Dear, dear, dear!</p>\n<p>so it would!” said the</p>\n<p>father, and he sat himself down aside of the other two, and started</p>\n<p>a-crying.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen by himself,</p>\n<p>and at last he went down into the cellar too, to see what they were</p>\n<p>after; and there they three sat a-crying side by side, and the beer</p>\n<p>running all over the floor.</p>\n<p>And he ran straight and turned the tap.</p>\n<p>Then he said: “Whatever are you three doing, sitting there crying, and</p>\n<p>letting the beer run all over the floor?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh!” says the father, “look at that horrid mallet!</p>\n<p>Suppose you and our</p>\n<p>daughter was to be married, and was to have a son, and he was to grow</p>\n<p>up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer, and the</p>\n<p>mallet was to fall on his head and kill him!” And then they all started</p>\n<p>a-crying worse than before.</p>\n<p>But the gentleman burst out a-laughing, and</p>\n",
        "<p>reached up and pulled out the mallet, and then he said: “I've travelled</p>\n<p>many miles, and I never met three such big sillies as you three before;</p>\n<p>and now I shall start out on my travels again, and when I can find</p>\n<p>three bigger sillies than you three, then I'll come back and marry your</p>\n<p>daughter.” So he wished them good-bye, and started off on his travels,</p>\n<p>and left them all crying because the girl had lost her sweetheart.</p>\n<p>Well, he set out, and he travelled a long way, and at last he came to a</p>\n",
        "<p>woman's cottage that had some grass growing on the roof.</p>\n<p>And the woman</p>\n<p>was trying to get her cow to go up a ladder to the grass, and the poor</p>\n<p>thing durst not go.</p>\n<p>So the gentleman asked the woman what she was doing.</p>\n<p>“Why, lookye,” she said, “look at all that beautiful grass.</p>\n<p>I'm going to</p>\n",
        "<p>get the cow on to the roof to eat it.</p>\n<p>She'll be quite safe, for I shall</p>\n<p>tie a string round her neck, and pass it down the chimney, and tie it</p>\n<p>to my wrist as I go about the house, so she can't fall off without my</p>\n<p>knowing it.” “Oh, you poor silly!” said the gentleman, “you should cut</p>\n<p>the grass and throw it down to the cow!” But the woman thought it was</p>\n<p>easier to get the cow up the ladder than to get the grass down, so she</p>\n",
        "<p>pushed her and coaxed her and got her up, and tied a string round her</p>\n<p>neck, and passed it down the chimney, and fastened it to her own wrist.</p>\n<p>And the gentleman went on his way, but he hadn't gone far when the cow</p>\n<p>tumbled off the roof, and hung by the string tied round her neck, and</p>\n<p>it strangled her.</p>\n<p>And the weight of the cow tied to her wrist pulled the</p>\n<p>woman up the chimney, and she stuck fast half-way and was smothered in</p>\n",
        "<p>the soot.</p>\n<p>Well, that was one big silly.</p>\n<p>And the gentleman went on and on, and he went to an inn to stop the</p>\n<p>night, and they were so full at the inn that they had to put him in a</p>\n<p>double-bedded room, and another traveller was to sleep in the other bed.</p>\n<p>The other man was a very pleasant fellow, and they got very friendly</p>\n<p>together; but in the morning, when they were both getting up, the</p>\n",
        "<p>gentleman was surprised to see the other hang his trousers on the knobs</p>\n<p>of the chest of drawers and run across the room and try to jump into</p>\n<p>them, and he tried over and over again, and couldn't manage it; and the</p>\n<p>gentleman wondered whatever he was doing it for.</p>\n<p>At last he stopped and</p>\n<p>wiped his face with his handkerchief.</p>\n<p>“Oh dear,” he says, “I do think</p>\n",
        "<p>trousers are the most awkwardest kind of clothes that ever were.</p>\n<p>I can't</p>\n<p>think who could have invented such things.</p>\n<p>It takes me the best part</p>\n<p>of an hour to get into mine every morning, and I get so hot!</p>\n<p>How do you</p>\n<p>manage yours?” So the gentleman burst out a-laughing, and showed him how</p>\n",
        "<p>to put them on; and he was very much obliged to him, and said he never</p>\n<p>should have thought of doing it that way.</p>\n<p>So that was another big silly.</p>\n<p>Then the gentleman went on his travels again; and he came to a village,</p>\n<p>and outside the village there was a pond, and round the pond was a crowd</p>\n<p>of people.</p>\n<p>And they had got rakes, and brooms, and pitchforks, reaching</p>\n",
        "<p>into the pond; and the gentleman asked what was the matter.</p>\n<p>“Why,” they</p>\n<p>say, “matter enough!</p>\n<p>Moon's tumbled into the pond, and we can't rake</p>\n<p>her out anyhow!” So the gentleman burst out a-laughing, and told them to</p>\n<p>look up into the sky, and that it was only the shadow in the water.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n",
        "<p>they wouldn't listen to him, and abused him shamefully, and he got away</p>\n<p>as quick as he could.</p>\n<p>So there was a whole lot of sillies bigger than them three sillies at</p>\n<p>home.</p>\n<p>So the gentleman turned back home again and married the farmer's</p>\n<p>daughter, and if they didn't live happy for ever after, that's nothing</p>\n<p>to do with you or me.</p>\n",
        "<h3>THE ROSE-TREE</h3>\n<p>There was once upon a time a good man who had two children: a girl by a</p>\n<p>first wife, and a boy by the second.</p>\n<p>The girl was as white as milk, and</p>\n<p>her lips were like cherries.</p>\n<p>Her hair was like golden silk, and it hung</p>\n<p>to the ground.</p>\n",
        "<p>Her brother loved her dearly, but her wicked stepmother</p>\n<p>hated her.</p>\n<p>“Child,” said the stepmother one day, “go to the grocer's</p>\n<p>shop and buy me a pound of candles.” She gave her the money; and the</p>\n<p>little girl went, bought the candles, and started on her return.</p>\n<p>There</p>\n<p>was a stile to cross.</p>\n",
        "<p>She put down the candles whilst she got over the</p>\n<p>stile.</p>\n<p>Up came a dog and ran off with the candles.</p>\n<p>She went back to the grocer's, and she got a second bunch.</p>\n<p>She came to</p>\n<p>the stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to climb over.</p>\n<p>Up came</p>\n",
        "<p>the dog and ran off with the candles.</p>\n<p>She went again to the grocer's, and she got a third bunch; and just the</p>\n<p>same happened.</p>\n<p>Then she came to her stepmother crying, for she had spent</p>\n<p>all the money and had lost three bunches of candles.</p>\n<p>The stepmother was angry, but she pretended not to mind the loss.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",
        "<p>said to the child: “Come, lay your head on my lap that I may comb your</p>\n<p>hair.” So the little one laid her head in the woman's lap, who proceeded</p>\n<p>to comb the yellow silken hair.</p>\n<p>And when she combed the hair fell over</p>\n<p>her knees, and rolled right down to the ground.</p>\n<p>Then the stepmother hated her more for the beauty of her hair; so she</p>\n<p>said to her, “I cannot part your hair on my knee, fetch a billet of</p>\n",
        "<p>wood.” So she fetched it.</p>\n<p>Then said the stepmother, “I cannot part your</p>\n<p>hair with a comb, fetch me an axe.” So she fetched it.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said the wicked woman, “lay your head down on the billet whilst I</p>\n<p>part your hair.”</p>\n<p>Well!</p>\n<p>she laid down her little golden head without fear; and whist!</p>\n",
        "<p>down</p>\n<p>came the axe, and it was off.</p>\n<p>So the mother wiped the axe and laughed.</p>\n<p>Then she took the heart and liver of the little girl, and she stewed</p>\n<p>them and brought them into the house for supper.</p>\n<p>The husband tasted them</p>\n<p>and shook his head.</p>\n",
        "<p>He said they tasted very strangely.</p>\n<p>She gave some</p>\n<p>to the little boy, but he would not eat.</p>\n<p>She tried to force him, but he</p>\n<p>refused, and ran out into the garden, and took up his little sister, and</p>\n<p>put her in a box, and buried the box under a rose-tree; and every day he</p>\n<p>went to the tree and wept, till his tears ran down on the box.</p>\n",
        "<p>One day the rose-tree flowered.</p>\n<p>It was spring, and there among the</p>\n<p>flowers was a white bird; and it sang, and sang, and sang like an</p>\n<p>angel out of heaven.</p>\n<p>Away it flew, and it went to a cobbler's shop, and</p>\n<p>perched itself on a tree hard by; and thus it sang,</p>\n<p>“My wicked mother slew me,</p>\n",
        "<p>My dear father ate me,</p>\n<p>My little brother whom I love</p>\n<p>Sits below, and I sing above</p>\n<p>Stick, stock, stone dead.”</p>\n<p>“Sing again that beautiful song,” asked the shoemaker.</p>\n<p>“If you will</p>\n<p>first give me those little red shoes you are making.” The cobbler gave</p>\n",
        "<p>the shoes, and the bird sang the song; then flew to a tree in front of a</p>\n<p>watchmaker's, and sang:</p>\n<p>“My wicked mother slew me,</p>\n<p>My dear father ate me,</p>\n<p>My little brother whom I love</p>\n<p>Sits below, and I sing above</p>\n<p>Stick, stock, stone dead.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh, the beautiful song!</p>\n<p>sing it again, sweet bird,” asked the</p>\n<p>watchmaker.</p>\n<p>“If you will give me first that gold watch and chain in your</p>\n<p>hand.” The jeweller gave the watch and chain.</p>\n<p>The bird took it in one</p>\n<p>foot, the shoes in the other, and, after having repeated the song, flew</p>\n",
        "<p>away to where three millers were picking a millstone.</p>\n<p>The bird perched</p>\n<p>on a tree and sang:</p>\n<p>“My wicked mother slew me,</p>\n<p>My dear father ate me,</p>\n<p>My little brother whom I love</p>\n<p>Sits below, and I sing above</p>\n",
        "<p>Stick!”</p>\n<p>Then one of the men put down his tool and looked up from his work,</p>\n<p>“Stock!”</p>\n<p>Then the second miller's man laid aside his tool and looked up,</p>\n<p>“Stone!”</p>\n<p>Then the third miller's man laid down his tool and looked up,</p>\n<p>“Dead!”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then all three cried out with one voice: “Oh, what a beautiful song!</p>\n<p>Sing it, sweet bird, again.” “If you will put the millstone round my</p>\n<p>neck,” said the bird.</p>\n<p>The men did what the bird wanted and away to the</p>\n<p>tree it flew with the millstone round its neck, the red shoes in one</p>\n<p>foot, and the gold watch and chain in the other.</p>\n<p>It sang the song and</p>\n",
        "<p>then flew home.</p>\n<p>It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house,</p>\n<p>and the stepmother said: “It thunders.” Then the little boy ran out to</p>\n<p>see the thunder, and down dropped the red shoes at his feet.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house once more, and the</p>\n<p>stepmother said again: “It thunders.” Then the father ran out and down</p>\n",
        "<p>fell the chain about his neck.</p>\n<p>In ran father and son, laughing and saying, “See, what fine things the</p>\n<p>thunder has brought us!” Then the bird rattled the millstone against the</p>\n<p>eaves of the house a third time; and the stepmother said: “It thunders</p>\n<p>again, perhaps the thunder has brought something for me,” and she</p>\n<p>ran out; but the moment she stepped outside the door, down fell the</p>\n<p>millstone on her head; and so she died.</p>\n",
        "<h3>THE OLD WOMAN AND HER PIG</h3>\n<p>An old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked</p>\n<p>sixpence.</p>\n<p>“What,” said she, “shall I do with this little sixpence?</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>will go to market, and buy a little pig.”</p>\n<p>As she was coming home, she came to a stile: but the piggy wouldn't go</p>\n",

        "<p>won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I shan't get home</p>\n<p>to-night.” But the water wouldn't.</p>\n<p>She went a little further, and she met an ox.</p>\n<p>So she said: “Ox!</p>\n<p>ox!</p>\n<p>drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't</p>\n<p>beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I</p>\n",

        "<p>Well, they went on till it was about dark, and they began to think of</p>\n<p>some place where they could spend the night.</p>\n<p>About this time they came</p>\n<p>in sight of a house, and Jack told them to keep still while he went up</p>\n<p>and looked in through the window.</p>\n<p>And there were some robbers counting</p>\n<p>over their money.</p>\n",

        "<p>Now, one day, when Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar was from home, Mrs.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, who was a very good housewife, was</p>\n<p>busily sweeping her house, when an unlucky thump of the broom brought</p>\n<p>the whole house clitter-clatter, clitter-clatter, about her ears.</p>\n<p>In an</p>\n<p>agony of grief she rushed forth to meet her husband.</p>\n",
        "<p>On seeing him she exclaimed, “Oh, Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, we are</p>\n<p>ruined, I have knocked the house down, and it is all to pieces!” Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar then said: “My dear, let us see what can be done.</p>\n<p>Here is</p>\n<p>the door; I will take it on my back, and we will go forth to seek our</p>\n",
        "<p>fortune.”</p>\n<p>They walked all that day, and at nightfall entered a thick forest.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>were both very, very tired, and Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar said: “My love, I will climb</p>\n<p>up into a tree, drag up the door, and you shall follow.” He accordingly</p>\n<p>did so, and they both stretched their weary limbs on the door, and fell</p>\n",
        "<p>fast asleep.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the night Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar was disturbed by the sound of</p>\n<p>voices underneath, and to his horror and dismay found that it was a band</p>\n<p>of thieves met to divide their booty.</p>\n<p>“Here, Jack,” said one, “here's five pounds for you; here, Bill, here's</p>\n<p>ten pounds for you; here, Bob, here's three pounds for you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar could listen no longer; his terror was so great that he</p>\n<p>trembled and trembled, and shook down the door on their heads.</p>\n<p>Away</p>\n<p>scampered the thieves, but Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar dared not quit his retreat till</p>\n<p>broad daylight.</p>\n",
        "<p>He then scrambled out of the tree, and went to lift up the door.</p>\n<p>What</p>\n<p>did he see but a number of golden guineas.</p>\n<p>“Come down, Mrs.</p>\n<p>Vinegar,” he</p>\n<p>cried; “come down, I say; our fortune's made, our fortune's made!</p>\n<p>Come</p>\n",
        "<p>down, I say.”</p>\n<p>Mrs.</p>\n<p>Vinegar got down as fast as she could, and when she saw the money</p>\n<p>she jumped for joy.</p>\n<p>“Now, my dear,” said she, “I'll tell you what you</p>\n<p>shall do.</p>\n<p>There is a fair at the neighbouring town; you shall take these</p>\n",
        "<p>forty guineas and buy a cow.</p>\n<p>I can make butter and cheese, which</p>\n<p>you shall sell at market, and we shall then be able to live very</p>\n<p>comfortably.”</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar joyfully agrees, takes the money, and off he goes to the</p>\n<p>fair.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he arrived, he walked up and down, and at length saw a</p>\n<p>beautiful red cow.</p>\n<p>It was an excellent milker, and perfect in every</p>\n<p>way.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” thought Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, “if I had but that cow, I should be the</p>\n<p>happiest, man alive.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So he offers the forty guineas for the cow, and the owner said that, as</p>\n<p>he was a friend, he'd oblige him.</p>\n<p>So the bargain was made, and he got</p>\n<p>the cow and he drove it backwards and forwards to show it.</p>\n<p>By-and-by he saw a man playing the bagpipes--Tweedle-dum tweedle-dee.</p>\n<p>The children followed him about, and he appeared to be pocketing money</p>\n<p>on all sides.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well,” thought Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, “if I had but that beautiful</p>\n<p>instrument I should be the happiest man alive--my fortune would be</p>\n<p>made.”</p>\n<p>So he went up to the man.</p>\n<p>“Friend,” says he, “what a beautiful</p>\n<p>instrument that is, and what a deal of money you must make.” “Why, yes,”</p>\n",
        "<p>said the man, “I make a great deal of money, to be sure, and it is a</p>\n<p>wonderful instrument.” “Oh!” cried Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, “how I should like to</p>\n<p>possess it!” “Well,” said the man, “as you are a friend, I don't much</p>\n<p>mind parting with it; you shall have it for that red cow.” “Done!” said</p>\n<p>the delighted Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar.</p>\n",
        "<p>So the beautiful red cow was given for the</p>\n<p>bagpipes.</p>\n<p>He walked up and down with his purchase; but it was in vain he tried</p>\n<p>to play a tune, and instead of pocketing pence, the boys followed him</p>\n<p>hooting, laughing, and pelting.</p>\n<p>Poor Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, his fingers grew very cold, and, just as he was</p>\n",
        "<p>leaving the town, he met a man with a fine thick pair of gloves.</p>\n<p>“Oh,</p>\n<p>my fingers are so very cold,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar to himself.</p>\n<p>“Now if I had</p>\n<p>but those beautiful gloves I should be the happiest man alive.” He went</p>\n<p>up to the man, and said to him, “Friend, you seem to have a capital pair</p>\n",
        "<p>of gloves there.” “Yes, truly,” cried the man; “and my hands are as warm</p>\n<p>as possible this cold November day.” “Well,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, “I should</p>\n<p>like to have them.”.</p>\n<p>“What will you give?” said the man; “as you are</p>\n<p>a friend, I don't much mind letting you have them for those bagpipes.”</p>\n<p>“Done!” cried Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Vinegar.</p>\n<p>He put on the gloves, and felt perfectly</p>\n<p>happy as he trudged homewards.</p>\n<p>At last he grew very tired, when he saw a man coming towards him with a</p>\n<p>good stout stick in his hand.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, “that I had but that stick!</p>\n",
        "<p>I should then be the</p>\n<p>happiest man alive.” He said to the man: “Friend!</p>\n<p>what a rare good stick</p>\n<p>you have got.” “Yes,” said the man; “I have used it for many a long</p>\n<p>mile, and a good friend it has been; but if you have a fancy for it,</p>\n<p>as you are a friend, I don't mind giving it to you for that pair of</p>\n<p>gloves.” Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Vinegar's hands were so warm, and his legs so tired, that</p>\n<p>he gladly made the exchange.</p>\n<p>As he drew near to the wood where he had left his wife, he heard a</p>\n<p>parrot on a tree calling out his name: “Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, you foolish man,</p>\n<p>you blockhead, you simpleton; you went to the fair, and laid out all</p>\n<p>your money in buying a cow.</p>\n",
        "<p>Not content with that, you changed it</p>\n<p>for bagpipes, on which you could not play, and which were not worth</p>\n<p>one-tenth of the money.</p>\n<p>You fool, you--you had no sooner got the</p>\n<p>bagpipes than you changed them for the gloves, which were not worth</p>\n<p>one-quarter of the money; and when you had got the gloves, you changed</p>\n<p>them for a poor miserable stick; and now for your forty guineas, cow,</p>\n",
        "<p>bagpipes, and gloves, you have nothing to show but that poor miserable</p>\n<p>stick, which you might have cut in any hedge.” On this the bird laughed</p>\n<p>and laughed, and Mr.</p>\n<p>Vinegar, falling into a violent rage, threw the</p>\n<p>stick at its head.</p>\n<p>The stick lodged in the tree, and he returned to his</p>\n<p>wife without money, cow, bagpipes, gloves, or stick, and she instantly</p>\n",
        "<p>gave him such a sound cudgelling that she almost broke every bone in his</p>\n<p>skin.</p>\n<h3>NIX NOUGHT NOTHING</h3>\n<p>There once lived a king and a queen as many a one has been.</p>\n<p>They were</p>\n<p>long married and had no children; but at last a baby-boy came to the</p>\n<p>queen when the king was away in the far countries.</p>\n",
        "<p>The queen would not</p>\n<p>christen the boy till the king came back, and she said, “We will just</p>\n<p>call him _Nix Nought Nothing_ until his father comes home.” But it was</p>\n<p>long before he came home, and the boy had grown a nice little laddie.</p>\n<p>At length the king was on his way back; but he had a big river to cross,</p>\n<p>and there was a whirlpool, and he could not get over the water.</p>\n<p>But a</p>\n",
        "<p>giant came up to him, and said “I'll carry you over.” But the king said:</p>\n<p>“What's your pay?” “O give me Nix, Nought, Nothing, and I will carry you</p>\n<p>over the water on my back.” The king had never heard that his son was</p>\n<p>called Nix Nought Nothing, and so he said: “O, I'll give you that and</p>\n<p>my thanks into the bargain.” When the king got home again, he was very</p>\n<p>happy to see his wife again, and his young son.</p>\n<p>She told him that she</p>\n",
        "<p>had not given the child any name, but just Nix Nought Nothing, until he</p>\n<p>should come home again himself.</p>\n<p>The poor king was in a terrible case.</p>\n<p>He said: “What have I done?</p>\n<p>I promised to give the giant who carried me</p>\n<p>over the river on his back, Nix Nought Nothing.” The king and the queen</p>\n<p>were sad and sorry, but they said: “When the giant comes we will give</p>\n",
        "<p>him the hen-wife's boy; he will never know the difference.” The next</p>\n<p>day the giant came to claim the king's promise, and he sent for the</p>\n<p>hen-wife's boy; and the giant went away with the boy on his back.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>travelled till he came to a big stone, and there he sat down to rest.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>said,</p>\n",
        "<p>“Hidge, Hodge, on my back, what time of day is that?”</p>\n<p>The poor little boy said: “It is the time that my mother, the hen-wife,</p>\n<p>takes up the eggs for the queen's breakfast.”</p>\n<p>The Giant was very angry, and dashed the boy's head on the stone and</p>\n<p>killed him.</p>\n<p>So he went back in a tower of a temper and this time they gave him the</p>\n<p>gardener's boy.</p>\n",
        "<p>He went off with him on his back till they got to the</p>\n<p>stone again when the giant sat down to rest.</p>\n<p>And he said:</p>\n<p>“Hidge, Hodge, on my back, what time of day do you make that?”</p>\n<p>The gardener's boy said: “Sure it's the time that my mother takes up the</p>\n<p>vegetables for the queen's dinner.” Then the giant was right wild and</p>\n<p>dashed his brains out on the stone.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the giant went back to the king's house in a terrible temper and</p>\n<p>said he would destroy them all if they did not give him Nix Nought</p>\n<p>Nothing this time.</p>\n<p>They had to do it; and when he came to the big stone,</p>\n<p>the giant said: “What time of day is that?” Nix Nought Nothing said: “It</p>\n<p>is the time that my father the king will be sitting down to supper.” The</p>\n<p>giant said: “I've got the right one now;” and took Nix Nought Nothing to</p>\n",
        "<p>his own house and brought him up till he was a man.</p>\n<p>The giant had a bonny daughter, and she and the lad grew very fond of</p>\n<p>each other.</p>\n<p>The giant said one day to Nix Nought Nothing: “I've work for</p>\n<p>you to-morrow.</p>\n<p>There is a stable seven miles long and seven miles broad,</p>\n<p>and it has not been cleaned for seven years, and you must clean it</p>\n",
        "<p>to-morrow, or I will have you for my supper.”</p>\n<p>The giant's daughter went out next morning with the lad's breakfast, and</p>\n<p>found him in a terrible state, for always as he cleaned out a bit, it</p>\n<p>just fell in again.</p>\n<p>The giant's daughter said she would help him, and</p>\n<p>she cried all the beasts in the field, and all the fowls of the air, and</p>\n<p>in a minute they all came, and carried away everything that was in the</p>\n",
        "<p>stable and made it all clean before the giant came home.</p>\n<p>He said: “Shame</p>\n<p>on the wit that helped you; but I have a worse job for you to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>Then he said to Nix Nought Nothing: “There's a lake seven miles long,</p>\n<p>and seven miles deep, and seven miles broad, and you must drain it</p>\n<p>to-morrow by nightfall, or else I'll have you for my supper.” Nix Nought</p>\n<p>Nothing began early next morning and tried to lave the water with his</p>\n",
        "<p>pail, but the lake was never getting any less, and he didn't know what</p>\n<p>to do; but the giant's daughter called on all the fish in the sea to</p>\n<p>come and drink the water, and very soon they drank it dry.</p>\n<p>When the</p>\n<p>giant saw the work done he was in a rage, and said: “I've a worse job</p>\n<p>for you to-morrow; there is a tree, seven miles high, and no branch on</p>\n<p>it, till you get to the top, and there is a nest with seven eggs in it,</p>\n",
        "<p>and you must bring down all the eggs without breaking one, or else I'll</p>\n<p>have you for my supper.” At first the giant's daughter did not know how</p>\n<p>to help Nix Nought Nothing; but she cut off first her fingers and then</p>\n<p>her toes, and made steps of them, and he clomb the tree and got all the</p>\n<p>eggs safe till he came just to the bottom, and then one was broken.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>they determined to run away together and after the giant's daughter had</p>\n",
        "<p>tidied up her hair a bit and got her magic flask they set out together</p>\n<p>as fast as they could run.</p>\n<p>And they hadn't got but three fields away</p>\n<p>when they looked back and saw the giant walking along at top speed after</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n<p>“Quick, quick,” called out the giant's daughter, “take my comb</p>\n<p>from my hair and throw it down.” Nix Nought Nothing took her comb from</p>\n",
        "<p>her hair and threw it down, and out of every one of its prongs there</p>\n<p>sprung up a fine thick briar in the way of the giant.</p>\n<p>You may be sure it</p>\n<p>took him a long time to work his way through the briar bush and by the</p>\n<p>time he was well through Nix Nought Nothing and his sweetheart had run</p>\n<p>on a tidy step away from him.</p>\n<p>But he soon came along after them and was</p>\n",
        "<p>just like to catch 'em up when the giant's daughter called out to Nix</p>\n<p>Nought Nothing, “Take my hair dagger and throw it down, quick, quick.”</p>\n<p>So Nix Nought Nothing threw down the hair dagger and out of it grew as</p>\n<p>quick as lightning a thick hedge of sharp razors placed criss-cross.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>giant had to tread very cautiously to get through all this and meanwhile</p>\n<p>the young lovers ran on, and on, and on, till they were nearly out of</p>\n",
        "<p>sight.</p>\n<p>But at last the giant was through, and it wasn't long before he</p>\n<p>was like to catch them up.</p>\n<p>But just as he was stretching out his hand</p>\n<p>to catch Nix Nought Nothing his daughter took out her magic flask and</p>\n<p>dashed it on the ground.</p>\n<p>And as it broke out of it welled a big, big</p>\n",
        "<p>wave that grew, and that grew, till it reached the giant's waist and</p>\n<p>then his neck, and when it got to his head, he was drowned dead, and</p>\n<p>dead, and dead indeed.</p>\n<p>So he goes out of the story.</p>\n<p>But Nix Nought Nothing fled on till where do you think they came to?</p>\n<p>Why, to near the castle of Nix Nought Nothing's father and mother.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n",
        "<p>the giant's daughter was so weary that she couldn't move a step further.</p>\n<p>So Nix Nought Nothing told her to wait there while he went and found</p>\n<p>out a lodging for the night.</p>\n<p>And he went on towards the lights of the</p>\n<p>castle, and on the way he came to the cottage of the hen-wife whose</p>\n<p>boy had had his brains dashed out by the giant.</p>\n<p>Now she knew Nix Nought</p>\n",
        "<p>Nothing in a moment, and hated him because he was the cause of her son's</p>\n<p>death.</p>\n<p>So when he asked his way to the castle she put a spell upon him,</p>\n<p>and when he got to the castle, no sooner was he let in than he fell down</p>\n<p>dead asleep upon a bench in the hall.</p>\n<p>The king and queen tried all they</p>\n<p>could do to wake him up, but all in vain.</p>\n",
        "<p>So the king promised that if</p>\n<p>any lady could wake him up she should marry him.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the giant's</p>\n<p>daughter was waiting and waiting for him to come back.</p>\n<p>And she went up</p>\n<p>into a tree to watch for him.</p>\n<p>The gardener's daughter, going to draw</p>\n",
        "<p>water in the well, saw the shadow of the lady in the water and thought</p>\n<p>it was herself, and said; “If I'm so bonny, if I'm so brave, why do you</p>\n<p>send me to draw water?” So she threw down her pail and went to see if</p>\n<p>she could wed the sleeping stranger.</p>\n<p>And she went to the hen-wife, who</p>\n<p>taught her an unspelling catch which would keep Nix Nought Nothing awake</p>\n<p>as long as the gardener's daughter liked.</p>\n",
        "<p>So she went up to the castle</p>\n<p>and sang her catch and Nix Nought Nothing was wakened for a bit and they</p>\n<p>promised to wed him to the gardener's daughter.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the gardener</p>\n<p>went down to draw water from the well and saw the shadow of the lady in</p>\n<p>the water.</p>\n<p>So he looks up and finds her, and he brought the lady from</p>\n",
        "<p>the tree, and led her into his house.</p>\n<p>And he told her that a stranger</p>\n<p>was to marry his daughter, and took her up to the castle and showed her</p>\n<p>the man: and it was Nix Nought Nothing asleep in a chair.</p>\n<p>And she saw</p>\n<p>him, and cried to him: “Waken, waken, and speak to me!” But he would not</p>\n<p>waken, and soon she cried:</p>\n",
        "<p>“I cleaned the stable, I laved the lake, and I clomb the tree,</p>\n<p>And all for the love of thee,</p>\n<p>And thou wilt not waken and speak to me.”</p>\n<p>The king and the queen heard this, and came to the bonny young lady, and</p>\n<p>she said:</p>\n<p>“I cannot get Nix Nought Nothing to speak to me for all that I can do.”</p>\n<p>Then were they greatly astonished when she spoke of Nix Nought Nothing,</p>\n",
        "<p>and asked where he was, and she said: “He that sits there in the chair.”</p>\n<p>Then they ran to him and kissed him and called him their own dear son;</p>\n<p>so they called for the gardener's daughter and made her sing her charm,</p>\n<p>and he wakened, and told them all that the giant's daughter had done</p>\n<p>for him, and of all her kindness.</p>\n<p>Then they took her in their arms and</p>\n<p>kissed her, and said she should now be their daughter, for their son</p>\n",
        "<p>should marry her.</p>\n<p>But they sent for the hen-wife and put her to death.</p>\n<p>And they lived happy all their days.</p>\n<h3>JACK HANNAFORD</h3>\n<p>There was an old soldier who had been long in the wars--so long, that</p>\n<p>he was quite out-at-elbows, and he did not know where to go to find a</p>\n<p>living.</p>\n",
        "<p>So he walked up moors, down glens, till at last he came to a</p>\n<p>farm, from which the good man had gone away to market.</p>\n<p>The wife of the</p>\n<p>farmer was a very foolish woman, who had been a widow when he married</p>\n<p>her; the farmer was foolish enough, too, and it is hard to say which of</p>\n<p>the two was the more foolish.</p>\n<p>When you've heard my tale you may decide.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now before the farmer goes to market says he to his wife: “Here is ten</p>\n<p>pounds all in gold, take care of it till I come home.” If the man had</p>\n<p>not been a fool he would never have given the money to his wife to keep.</p>\n<p>Well, off he went in his cart to market, and the wife said to herself:</p>\n<p>“I will keep the ten pounds quite safe from thieves;” so she tied it up</p>\n<p>in a rag, and she put the rag up the parlour chimney.</p>\n<p>“There,” said she, “no thieves will ever find it now, that is quite</p>\n",
        "<p>sure.”</p>\n<p>Jack Hannaford, the old soldier, came and rapped at the door.</p>\n<p>“Who is there?” asked the wife.</p>\n<p>“Jack Hannaford.”</p>\n<p>“Where do you come from?”</p>\n<p>“Paradise.”</p>\n<p>“Lord a' mercy!</p>\n",
        "<p>and maybe you've seen my old man there,” alluding to her</p>\n<p>former husband.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>\n<p>“And how was he a-doing?” asked the goody.</p>\n<p>“But middling; he cobbles old shoes, and he has nothing but cabbage for</p>\n<p>victuals.”</p>\n<p>“Deary me!” exclaimed the woman.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Didn't he send a message to me?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, he did,” replied Jack Hannaford.</p>\n<p>“He said that he was out of</p>\n<p>leather, and his pockets were empty, so you were to send him a few</p>\n<p>shillings to buy a fresh stock of leather.”</p>\n<p>“He shall have them, bless his poor soul!” And away went the wife to the</p>\n<p>parlour chimney, and she pulled the rag with the ten pounds in it from</p>\n",
        "<p>the chimney, and she gave the whole sum to the soldier, telling him that</p>\n<p>her old man was to use as much as he wanted, and to send back the rest.</p>\n<p>It was not long that Jack waited after receiving the money; he went off</p>\n<p>as fast as he could walk.</p>\n<p>Presently the farmer came home and asked for his money.</p>\n<p>The wife told</p>\n<p>him that she had sent it by a soldier to her former husband in Paradise,</p>\n",
        "<p>to buy him leather for cobbling the shoes of the saints and angels of</p>\n<p>Heaven.</p>\n<p>The farmer was very angry, and he swore that he had never met</p>\n<p>with such a fool as his wife.</p>\n<p>But the wife said that her husband was a</p>\n<p>greater fool for letting her have the money.</p>\n<p>There was no time to waste words; so the farmer mounted his horse and</p>\n",
        "<p>rode off after Jack Hannaford.</p>\n<p>The old soldier heard the horse's hoofs</p>\n<p>clattering on the road behind him, so he knew it must be the farmer</p>\n<p>pursuing him.</p>\n<p>He lay down on the ground, and shading his eyes with one</p>\n<p>hand, looked up into the sky, and pointed heavenwards with the other</p>\n<p>hand.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What are you about there?” asked the farmer, pulling up.</p>\n<p>“Lord save you!” exclaimed Jack: “I've seen a rare sight.”</p>\n<p>“What was that?”</p>\n<p>“A man going straight up into the sky, as if he were walking on a road.”</p>\n<p>“Can you see him still?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I can.”</p>\n<p>“Where?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Get off your horse and lie down.”</p>\n<p>“If you will hold the horse.”</p>\n<p>Jack did so readily.</p>\n<p>“I cannot see him,” said the farmer.</p>\n<p>“Shade your eyes with your hand, and you'll soon see a man flying away</p>\n<p>from you.”</p>\n<p>Sure enough he did so, for Jack leaped on the horse, and rode away with</p>\n",
        "<p>it.</p>\n<p>The farmer walked home without his horse.</p>\n<p>“You are a bigger fool than I am,” said the wife; “for I did only one</p>\n<p>foolish thing, and you have done two.”</p>\n<h3>BINNORIE</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time there were two king's daughters lived in a bower near</p>\n<p>the bonny mill-dams of Binnorie.</p>\n",
        "<p>And Sir William came wooing the eldest</p>\n<p>and won her love and plighted troth with glove and with ring.</p>\n<p>But after</p>\n<p>a time he looked upon the youngest, with her cherry cheeks and golden</p>\n<p>hair, and his love grew towards her till he cared no longer for the</p>\n<p>eldest one.</p>\n<p>So she hated her sister for taking away Sir William's love,</p>\n",
        "<p>and day by day her hate grew upon her, and she plotted and she planned</p>\n<p>how to get rid of her.</p>\n<p>So one fine morning, fair and clear, she said to her sister, “Let us</p>\n<p>go and see our father's boats come in at the bonny mill-stream of</p>\n<p>Binnorie.” So they went there hand in hand.</p>\n<p>And when they got to the</p>\n<p>river's bank the youngest got upon a stone to watch for the coming of</p>\n",
        "<p>the boats.</p>\n<p>And her sister, coming behind her, caught her round the waist</p>\n<p>and dashed her into the rushing mill-stream of Binnorie.</p>\n<p>“O sister, sister, reach me your hand!” she cried, as she floated away,</p>\n<p>“and you shall have half of all I've got or shall get.”</p>\n<p>“No, sister, I'll reach you no hand of mine, for I am the heir to all</p>\n<p>your land.</p>\n",
        "<p>Shame on me if I touch the hand that has come 'twixt me and</p>\n<p>my own heart's love.”</p>\n<p>“O sister, O sister, then reach me your glove!” she cried, as she</p>\n<p>floated further away, “and you shall have your William again.”</p>\n<p>“Sink on,” cried the cruel princess, “no hand or glove of mine you'll</p>\n<p>touch.</p>\n<p>Sweet William will be all mine when you are sunk beneath the</p>\n",
        "<p>bonny mill-stream of Binnorie.” And she turned and went home to the</p>\n<p>king's castle.</p>\n<p>And the princess floated down the mill-stream, sometimes swimming</p>\n<p>and sometimes sinking, till she came near the mill.</p>\n<p>Now the miller's</p>\n<p>daughter was cooking that day, and needed water for her cooking.</p>\n<p>And as</p>\n",
        "<p>she went to draw it from the stream, she saw something floating towards</p>\n<p>the mill-dam, and she called out, “Father!</p>\n<p>father!</p>\n<p>draw your dam.</p>\n<p>There's something white--a merry maid or a milk-white swan--coming down</p>\n<p>the stream.” So the miller hastened to the dam and stopped the heavy</p>\n<p>cruel mill-wheels.</p>\n",
        "<p>And then they took out the princess and laid her on</p>\n<p>the bank.</p>\n<p>Fair and beautiful she looked as she lay there.</p>\n<p>In her golden hair were</p>\n<p>pearls and precious stones; you could not see her waist for her golden</p>\n<p>girdle; and the golden fringe of her white dress came down over her lily</p>\n<p>feet.</p>\n",
        "<p>But she was drowned, drowned!</p>\n<p>And as she lay there in her beauty a famous harper passed by the</p>\n<p>mill-dam of Binnorie, and saw her sweet pale face.</p>\n<p>And though he</p>\n<p>travelled on far away he never forgot that face, and after many days he</p>\n<p>came back to the bonny mill-stream of Binnorie.</p>\n<p>But then all he could</p>\n",
        "<p>find of her where they had put her to rest were her bones and her</p>\n<p>golden hair.</p>\n<p>So he made a harp out of her breast-bone and her hair, and</p>\n<p>travelled on up the hill from the mill-dam of Binnorie, till he came to</p>\n<p>the castle of the king her father.</p>\n<p>That night they were all gathered in the castle hall to hear the great</p>\n<p>harper--king and queen, their daughter and son, Sir William and all</p>\n",
        "<p>their Court.</p>\n<p>And first the harper sang to his old harp, making them joy</p>\n<p>and be glad or sorrow and weep just as he liked.</p>\n<p>But while he sang he</p>\n<p>put the harp he had made that day on a stone in the hall.</p>\n<p>And presently</p>\n<p>it began to sing by itself, low and clear, and the harper stopped and</p>\n",
        "<p>all were hushed.</p>\n<p>And this was what the harp sung:</p>\n<p>“O yonder sits my father, the king,</p>\n<p>Binnorie, O Binnorie;</p>\n<p>And yonder sits my mother, the queen;</p>\n<p>By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie,</p>\n<p>“And yonder stands my brother Hugh,</p>\n",
        "<p>Binnorie, O Binnorie;</p>\n<p>And by him, my William, false and true;</p>\n<p>By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie.”</p>\n<p>Then they all wondered, and the harper told them how he had seen the</p>\n<p>princess lying drowned on the bank near the bonny mill-dams o'</p>\n<p>Binnorie, and how he had afterwards made this harp out of her hair and</p>\n<p>breast-bone.</p>\n",
        "<p>Just then the harp began singing again, and this was what</p>\n<p>it sang out loud and clear:</p>\n<p>“And there sits my sister who drownèd me</p>\n<p>By the bonny mill-dams o' Binnorie.”</p>\n<p>And the harp snapped and broke, and never sang more.</p>\n<h3>MOUSE AND MOUSER</h3>\n<p>The Mouse went to visit the Cat, and found her sitting behind the hall</p>\n",

        "<p>“Why, I love you as fresh meat loves salt,” says she.</p>\n<p>Well, he was that angry.</p>\n<p>“You don't love me at all,” says he, “and in</p>\n<p>my house you stay no more.” So he drove her out there and then, and shut</p>\n<p>the door in her face.</p>\n<p>Well, she went away on and on till she came to a fen, and there she</p>\n<p>gathered a lot of rushes and made them into a kind of a sort of a</p>\n",
        "<p>cloak with a hood, to cover her from head to foot, and to hide her fine</p>\n<p>clothes.</p>\n<p>And then she went on and on till she came to a great house.</p>\n<p>“Do you want a maid?” says she.</p>\n<p>“No, we don't,” said they.</p>\n<p>“I haven't nowhere to go,” says she; “and I ask no wages, and do any</p>\n<p>sort of work,” says she.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well,” says they, “if you like to wash the pots and scrape the</p>\n<p>saucepans you may stay,” said they.</p>\n<p>So she stayed there and washed the pots and scraped the saucepans and</p>\n<p>did all the dirty work.</p>\n<p>And because she gave no name they called her</p>\n<p>“Cap o' Rushes.”</p>\n<p>Well, one day there was to be a great dance a little way off, and the</p>\n",

        "<p>with her cap o' rushes and cleaned herself, and away she went to the</p>\n<p>dance.</p>\n<p>The master's son was rarely glad when he saw her.</p>\n<p>He danced with none</p>\n<p>but her and never took his eyes off her.</p>\n<p>When she wouldn't tell him her</p>\n<p>name, nor where she came from, he gave her a ring and told her if he</p>\n",

        "<p>sell Milky-white, and then we'll see what we can do.”</p>\n<p>So he took the cow's halter in his hand, and off he starts.</p>\n<p>He hadn't</p>\n<p>gone far when he met a funny-looking old man who said to him: “Good</p>\n<p>morning, Jack.”</p>\n<p>“Good morning to you,” said Jack, and wondered how he knew his name.</p>\n<p>“Well, Jack, and where are you off to?” said the man.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I'm going to market to sell our cow here.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you look the proper sort of chap to sell cows,” said the man; “I</p>\n<p>wonder if you know how many beans make five.”</p>\n<p>“Two in each hand and one in your mouth,” says Jack, as sharp as a</p>\n<p>needle.</p>\n<p>“Right you are,” said the man, “and here they are the very beans</p>\n<p>themselves,” he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of</p>\n",
        "<p>strange-looking beans.</p>\n<p>“As you are so sharp,” says he, “I don't mind</p>\n<p>doing a swop with you--your cow for these beans.”</p>\n<p>“Walker!” says Jack; “wouldn't you like it?”</p>\n<p>“Ah!</p>\n<p>you don't know what these beans are,” said the man; “if you plant</p>\n<p>them over-night, by morning they grow right up to the sky.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Really?” says Jack; “you don't say so.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that is so, and if it doesn't turn out to be true you can have</p>\n<p>your cow back.”</p>\n<p>“Right,” says Jack, and hands him over Milky-white's halter and pockets</p>\n<p>the beans.</p>\n<p>Back goes Jack home, and as he hadn't gone very far it wasn't dusk by</p>\n<p>the time he got to his door.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What back, Jack?” said his mother; “I see you haven't got Milky-white,</p>\n<p>so you've sold her.</p>\n<p>How much did you get for her?”</p>\n<p>“You'll never guess, mother,” says Jack.</p>\n<p>“No, you don't say so.</p>\n<p>Good boy!</p>\n<p>Five pounds, ten, fifteen, no, it can't</p>\n",
        "<p>be twenty.”</p>\n<p>“I told you you couldn't guess, what do you say to these beans; they're</p>\n<p>magical, plant them over-night and----”</p>\n<p>“What!” says Jack's mother, “have you been such a fool, such a dolt,</p>\n<p>such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-white, the best milker in the</p>\n<p>parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans.</p>\n<p>Take that!</p>\n",
        "<p>Take that!</p>\n<p>Take that!</p>\n<p>And as for your precious beans here they go out of</p>\n<p>the window.</p>\n<p>And now off with you to bed.</p>\n<p>Not a sup shall you drink, and</p>\n<p>not a bit shall you swallow this very night.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic, and sad and sorry</p>\n<p>he was, to be sure, as much for his mother's sake, as for the loss of</p>\n<p>his supper.</p>\n<p>At last he dropped off to sleep.</p>\n<p>When he woke up, the room looked so funny.</p>\n<p>The sun was shining into part</p>\n<p>of it, and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady.</p>\n",
        "<p>So Jack jumped</p>\n<p>up and dressed himself and went to the window.</p>\n<p>And what do you think</p>\n<p>he saw?</p>\n<p>why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the</p>\n<p>garden, had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up</p>\n<p>till it reached the sky.</p>\n",
        "<p>So the man spoke truth after all.</p>\n<p>The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack's window, so all he had to</p>\n<p>do was to open it and give a jump on to the beanstalk which was made</p>\n<p>like a big plaited ladder.</p>\n<p>So Jack climbed and he climbed and he climbed</p>\n<p>and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last</p>\n<p>he reached the sky.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when he got there he found a long broad road</p>\n<p>going as straight as a dart.</p>\n<p>So he walked along and he walked along</p>\n<p>and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house, and on the</p>\n<p>doorstep there was a great big tall woman.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, mum,” says Jack, quite polite-like.</p>\n<p>“Could you be so kind</p>\n",
        "<p>as to give me some breakfast.” For he hadn't had anything to eat, you</p>\n<p>know, the night before and was as hungry as a hunter.</p>\n<p>“It's breakfast you want, is it?” says the great big tall woman, “it's</p>\n<p>breakfast you'll be if you don't move off from here.</p>\n<p>My man is an ogre</p>\n<p>and there's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast.</p>\n<p>You'd</p>\n",
        "<p>better be moving on or he'll soon be coming.”</p>\n<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>please mum, do give me something to eat, mum.</p>\n<p>I've had nothing to</p>\n<p>eat since yesterday morning, really and truly, mum,” says Jack.</p>\n<p>“I may</p>\n<p>as well be broiled, as die of hunger.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Well, the ogre's wife wasn't such a bad sort, after all.</p>\n<p>So she took</p>\n<p>Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a junk of bread and cheese and a jug</p>\n<p>of milk.</p>\n<p>But Jack hadn't half finished these when thump!</p>\n<p>thump!</p>\n<p>thump!</p>\n",
        "<p>the whole house began to tremble with the noise of someone coming.</p>\n<p>“Goodness gracious me!</p>\n<p>It's my old man,” said the ogre's wife, “what on</p>\n<p>earth shall I do?</p>\n<p>Here, come quick and jump in here.” And she bundled</p>\n<p>Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in.</p>\n<p>He was a big one, to be sure.</p>\n",
        "<p>At his belt he had three calves strung up</p>\n<p>by the heels, and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table and</p>\n<p>said: “Here, wife, broil me a couple of these for breakfast.</p>\n<p>Ah what's</p>\n<p>this I smell?</p>\n<p>Fee-fi-fo-fum,</p>\n<p>I smell the blood of an Englishman,</p>\n",
        "<p>Be he alive, or be he dead</p>\n<p>I'll have his bones to grind my bread.”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense, dear,” said his wife, “you're dreaming.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps you smell</p>\n<p>the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterday's dinner.</p>\n<p>Here, go you and have a wash and tidy up, and by the time you come back</p>\n<p>your breakfast'll be ready for you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So the ogre went off, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven</p>\n<p>and run off when the woman told him not.</p>\n<p>“Wait till he's asleep,” says</p>\n<p>she; “he always has a snooze after breakfast.”</p>\n<p>Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big chest</p>\n<p>and takes out of it a couple of bags of gold and sits down counting them</p>\n<p>till at last his head began to nod and he began to snore till the whole</p>\n",
        "<p>house shook again.</p>\n<p>Then Jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the</p>\n<p>ogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters</p>\n<p>till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold</p>\n<p>which of course fell in to his mother's garden, and then he climbed down</p>\n<p>and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed</p>\n<p>her the gold and said: “Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans.</p>\n",
        "<p>They are really magical, you see.”</p>\n<p>So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last they came to</p>\n<p>the end of that so Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more up at</p>\n<p>the top of the beanstalk.</p>\n<p>So one fine morning he got up early, and got</p>\n<p>on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and</p>\n<p>he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he got on the road</p>\n",
        "<p>again and came to the great big tall house he had been to before.</p>\n<p>There,</p>\n<p>sure enough, was the great big tall woman a-standing on the door-step.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, mum,” says Jack, as bold as brass, “could you be so good</p>\n<p>as to give me something to eat?”</p>\n<p>“Go away, my boy,” said the big, tall woman, “or else my man will eat</p>\n<p>you up for breakfast.</p>\n",
        "<p>But aren't you the youngster who came here once</p>\n<p>before?</p>\n<p>Do you know, that very day, my man missed one of his bags of</p>\n<p>gold.”</p>\n<p>“That's strange, mum,” says Jack, “I dare say I could tell you something</p>\n<p>about that but I'm so hungry I can't speak till I've had something to</p>\n<p>eat.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Well the big tall woman was that curious that she took him in and gave</p>\n<p>him something to eat.</p>\n<p>But he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly as</p>\n<p>he could when thump!</p>\n<p>thump!</p>\n<p>thump!</p>\n<p>they heard the giant's footstep, and</p>\n",
        "<p>his wife hid Jack away in the oven.</p>\n<p>All happened as it did before.</p>\n<p>In came the ogre as he did before, said:</p>\n<p>“Fee-fi-fo-fum,” and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen.</p>\n<p>Then he</p>\n<p>said: “Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs.” So she brought</p>\n<p>it, and the ogre said: “Lay,” and it laid an egg all of gold.</p>\n",
        "<p>And then</p>\n<p>the ogre began to nod his head, and to snore till the house shook.</p>\n<p>Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden</p>\n<p>hen, and was off before you could say “Jack Robinson.” But this time the</p>\n<p>hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre, and just as Jack got out of the</p>\n<p>house he heard him calling: “Wife, wife, what have you done with my</p>\n<p>golden hen?”</p>\n",
        "<p>And the wife said: “Why, my dear?”</p>\n<p>But that was all Jack heard, for he rushed off to the beanstalk and</p>\n<p>climbed down like a house on fire.</p>\n<p>And when he got home he showed his</p>\n<p>mother the wonderful hen and said “Lay,” to it; and it laid a golden egg</p>\n<p>every time he said “Lay.”</p>\n<p>Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't very long before he determined</p>\n",
        "<p>to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>one fine morning, he got up early, and went on to the beanstalk, and he</p>\n<p>climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till he got to</p>\n<p>the top.</p>\n<p>But this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogre's</p>\n<p>house.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when he got near it he waited behind a bush till he saw the</p>\n<p>ogre's wife come out with a pail to get some water, and then he crept</p>\n<p>into the house and got into the copper.</p>\n<p>He hadn't been there long when</p>\n<p>he heard thump!</p>\n<p>thump!</p>\n<p>thump!</p>\n",
        "<p>as before, and in come the ogre and his</p>\n<p>wife.</p>\n<p>“Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman,” cried out the ogre;</p>\n<p>“I smell him, wife, I smell him.”</p>\n<p>“Do you, my dearie?” says the ogre's wife.</p>\n<p>“Then if it's that little</p>\n<p>rogue that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs he's</p>\n",
        "<p>sure to have got into the oven.” And they both rushed to the oven.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>Jack wasn't there, luckily, and the ogre's wife said: “There you are</p>\n<p>again with your fee-fi-fo-fum.</p>\n<p>Why of course it's the laddie you caught</p>\n<p>last night that I've broiled for your breakfast.</p>\n<p>How forgetful I am, and</p>\n",
        "<p>how careless you are not to tell the difference between a live un and a</p>\n<p>dead un.”</p>\n<p>So the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it, but every now and</p>\n<p>then he would mutter: “Well, I could have sworn----” and he'd get up</p>\n<p>and search the larder and the cupboards, and everything, only luckily he</p>\n<p>didn't think of the copper.</p>\n<p>After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: “Wife, wife, bring me my</p>\n",
        "<p>golden harp.” So she brought it and put it on the table before him.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>he said: “Sing!” and the golden harp sang most beautifully.</p>\n<p>And it</p>\n<p>went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like</p>\n<p>thunder.</p>\n<p>Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down like a</p>\n",
        "<p>mouse and crept on hands and knees till he got to the table when he got</p>\n<p>up and caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the</p>\n<p>door.</p>\n<p>But the harp called out quite loud: “Master!</p>\n<p>Master!” and the ogre</p>\n<p>woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp.</p>\n<p>Jack ran as fast as he could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would</p>\n",
        "<p>soon have caught him only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew</p>\n<p>where he was going.</p>\n<p>When he got to the beanstalk the ogre was not more</p>\n<p>than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw Jack disappear like, and</p>\n<p>when he got up to the end of the road he saw Jack underneath climbing</p>\n<p>down for dear life.</p>\n<p>Well, the ogre didn't like trusting himself to such</p>\n",
        "<p>a ladder, and he stood and waited, so Jack got another start.</p>\n<p>But just</p>\n<p>then the harp cried out: “Master!</p>\n<p>master!” and the ogre swung himself</p>\n<p>down on to the beanstalk which shook with his weight.</p>\n<p>Down climbs Jack,</p>\n<p>and after him climbed the ogre.</p>\n",
        "<p>By this time Jack had climbed down and</p>\n<p>climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home.</p>\n<p>So he called</p>\n<p>out: “Mother!</p>\n<p>mother!</p>\n<p>bring me an axe, bring me an axe.” And his mother</p>\n<p>came rushing out with the axe in her hand, but when she came to the</p>\n",
        "<p>beanstalk she stood stock still with fright for there she saw the ogre</p>\n<p>just coming down below the clouds.</p>\n<p>But Jack jumped down and got hold of the axe and gave a chop at the</p>\n<p>beanstalk which cut it half in two.</p>\n<p>The ogre felt the beanstalk shake</p>\n<p>and quiver so he stopped to see what was the matter.</p>\n<p>Then Jack gave</p>\n",
        "<p>another chop with the axe, and the beanstalk was cut in two and began</p>\n<p>to topple over.</p>\n<p>Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the</p>\n<p>beanstalk came toppling after.</p>\n<p>Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing that</p>\n<p>and selling the golden eggs, Jack and his mother became very rich, and</p>\n<p>he married a great princess, and they lived happy ever after.</p>\n",
        "<h3>THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme</p>\n<p>And monkeys chewed tobacco,</p>\n<p>And hens took snuff to make them tough,</p>\n<p>And ducks went quack, quack, quack, O!</p>\n<p>There was an old sow with three little pigs, and as she had not enough</p>\n<p>to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune.</p>\n",
        "<p>The first that</p>\n<p>went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him:</p>\n<p>“Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house.”</p>\n<p>Which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it.</p>\n<p>Presently</p>\n<p>came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said:</p>\n<p>“Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p>\n",
        "<p>To which the pig answered:</p>\n<p>“No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>\n<p>The wolf then answered to that:</p>\n<p>“Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.”</p>\n<p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the</p>\n<p>little pig.</p>\n<p>The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Please, man, give me that furze to build a house.”</p>\n<p>Which the man did, and the pig built his house.</p>\n<p>Then along came the</p>\n<p>wolf, and said:</p>\n<p>“Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p>\n<p>“No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>\n<p>“Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at last</p>\n<p>he blew the house down, and he ate up the little pig.</p>\n<p>The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said:</p>\n<p>“Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with.”</p>\n<p>So the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them.</p>\n<p>So the</p>\n<p>wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Little pig, little pig, let me come in.”</p>\n<p>“No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”</p>\n<p>“Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.”</p>\n<p>Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he</p>\n<p>puffed and huffed; but he could _not_ get the house down.</p>\n<p>When he found</p>\n<p>that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house</p>\n",
        "<p>down, he said:</p>\n<p>“Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.”</p>\n<p>“Where?” said the little pig.</p>\n<p>“Oh, in Mr.</p>\n<p>Smith's Home-field, and if you will be ready tomorrow</p>\n<p>morning I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some for</p>\n<p>dinner.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Very well,” said the little pig, “I will be ready.</p>\n<p>What time do you</p>\n<p>mean to go?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, at six o'clock.”</p>\n<p>Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf</p>\n<p>came (which he did about six) and who said:</p>\n<p>“Little Pig, are you ready?”</p>\n",
        "<p>The little pig said: “Ready!</p>\n<p>I have been and come back again, and got a</p>\n<p>nice potful for dinner.”</p>\n<p>The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the</p>\n<p>little pig somehow or other, so he said:</p>\n<p>“Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.”</p>\n<p>“Where?” said the pig.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Down at Merry-garden,” replied the wolf, “and if you will not deceive</p>\n<p>me I will come for you, at five o'clock tomorrow and get some apples.”</p>\n<p>Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o'clock, and</p>\n<p>went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but</p>\n<p>he had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was</p>\n<p>coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may suppose,</p>\n<p>frightened him very much.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the wolf came up he said:</p>\n<p>“Little pig, what!</p>\n<p>are you here before me?</p>\n<p>Are they nice apples?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, very,” said the little pig.</p>\n<p>“I will throw you down one.”</p>\n<p>And he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the</p>\n",
        "<p>little pig jumped down and ran home.</p>\n<p>The next day the wolf came again,</p>\n<p>and said to the little pig:</p>\n<p>“Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?”</p>\n<p>“Oh yes,” said the pig, “I will go; what time shall you be ready?”</p>\n<p>“At three,” said the wolf.</p>\n<p>So the little pig went off before the time</p>\n",
        "<p>as usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was</p>\n<p>going home with, when he saw the wolf coming.</p>\n<p>Then he could not tell</p>\n<p>what to do.</p>\n<p>So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned it</p>\n<p>round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened</p>\n<p>the wolf so much, that he ran home without going to the fair.</p>\n",
        "<p>He went</p>\n<p>to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a</p>\n<p>great round thing which came down the hill past him.</p>\n<p>Then the little pig</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Hah, I frightened you, then.</p>\n<p>I had been to the fair and bought a</p>\n",
        "<p>butter-churn, and when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down the</p>\n<p>hill.”</p>\n<p>Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he _would_ eat up the</p>\n<p>little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.</p>\n<p>When the</p>\n<p>little pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and</p>\n<p>made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, took</p>\n",
        "<p>off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover</p>\n<p>again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived</p>\n<p>happy ever afterwards.</p>\n<h3>THE MASTER AND HIS PUPIL</h3>\n<p>There was once a very learned man in the north-country who knew all the</p>\n<p>languages under the sun, and who was acquainted with all the mysteries</p>\n<p>of creation.</p>\n",
        "<p>He had one big book bound in black calf and clasped with</p>\n<p>iron, and with iron corners, and chained to a table which was made fast</p>\n<p>to the floor; and when he read out of this book, he unlocked it with an</p>\n<p>iron key, and none but he read from it, for it contained all the secrets</p>\n<p>of the spiritual world.</p>\n<p>It told how many angels there were in heaven,</p>\n<p>and how they marched in their ranks, and sang in their quires, and what</p>\n",
        "<p>were their several functions, and what was the name of each great angel</p>\n<p>of might.</p>\n<p>And it told of the demons, how many of them there were, and</p>\n<p>what were their several powers, and their labours, and their names, and</p>\n<p>how they might be summoned, and how tasks might be imposed on them, and</p>\n<p>how they might be chained to be as slaves to man.</p>\n<p>Now the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad, and he acted as</p>\n",
        "<p>servant to the great master, but never was he suffered to look into the</p>\n<p>black book, hardly to enter the private room.</p>\n<p>One day the master was out, and then the lad, as curious as could be,</p>\n<p>hurried to the chamber where his master kept his wondrous apparatus</p>\n<p>for changing copper into gold, and lead into silver, and where was his</p>\n<p>mirror in which he could see all that was passing in the world, and</p>\n<p>where was the shell which when held to the ear whispered all the words</p>\n",
        "<p>that were being spoken by anyone the master desired to know about.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>lad tried in vain with the crucibles to turn copper and lead into gold</p>\n<p>and silver--he looked long and vainly into the mirror; smoke and clouds</p>\n<p>passed over it, but he saw nothing plain, and the shell to his ear</p>\n<p>produced only indistinct murmurings, like the breaking of distant seas</p>\n<p>on an unknown shore.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I can do nothing,” he said; “as I don't know the</p>\n<p>right words to utter, and they are locked up in yon book.”</p>\n<p>He looked round, and, see!</p>\n<p>the book was unfastened; the master had</p>\n<p>forgotten to lock it before he went out.</p>\n<p>The boy rushed to it, and</p>\n<p>unclosed the volume.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was written with red and black ink, and much of</p>\n<p>it he could not understand; but he put his finger on a line and spelled</p>\n<p>it through.</p>\n<p>At once the room was darkened, and the house trembled; a clap of thunder</p>\n<p>rolled through the passage and the old room, and there stood before him</p>\n<p>a horrible, horrible form, breathing fire, and with eyes like burning</p>\n<p>lamps.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was the demon Beelzebub, whom he had called up to serve him.</p>\n<p>“Set me a task!” said he, with a voice like the roaring of an iron</p>\n<p>furnace.</p>\n<p>The boy only trembled, and his hair stood up.</p>\n<p>“Set me a task, or I shall strangle thee!”</p>\n<p>But the lad could not speak.</p>\n<p>Then the evil spirit stepped towards him,</p>\n",
        "<p>and putting forth his hands touched his throat.</p>\n<p>The fingers burned his</p>\n<p>flesh.</p>\n<p>“Set me a task!”</p>\n<p>“Water yon flower,” cried the boy in despair, pointing to a geranium</p>\n<p>which stood in a pot on the floor.</p>\n<p>Instantly the spirit left the room,</p>\n",
        "<p>but in another instant he returned with a barrel on his back, and poured</p>\n<p>its contents over the flower; and again and again he went and came, and</p>\n<p>poured more and more water, till the floor of the room was ankle-deep.</p>\n<p>“Enough, enough!” gasped the lad; but the demon heeded him not; the lad</p>\n<p>didn't know the words by which to send him away, and still he fetched</p>\n<p>water.</p>\n<p>It rose to the boy's knees and still more water was poured.</p>\n",
        "<p>It mounted</p>\n<p>to his waist, and Beelzebub still kept on bringing barrels full.</p>\n<p>It rose</p>\n<p>to his armpits, and he scrambled to the table-top.</p>\n<p>And now the water</p>\n<p>in the room stood up to the window and washed against the glass, and</p>\n<p>swirled around his feet on the table.</p>\n",
        "<p>It still rose; it reached his</p>\n<p>breast.</p>\n<p>In vain he cried; the evil spirit would not be dismissed, and</p>\n<p>to this day he would have been pouring water, and would have drowned</p>\n<p>all Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>But the master remembered on his journey that he had</p>\n<p>not locked his book, and therefore returned, and at the moment when</p>\n",
        "<p>the water was bubbling about the pupil's chin, rushed into the room and</p>\n<p>spoke the words which cast Beelzebub back into his fiery home.</p>\n<h3>TITTY MOUSE AND TATTY MOUSE</h3>\n<p>Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse both lived in a house,</p>\n<p>Titty Mouse went a leasing and Tatty Mouse went a leasing,</p>\n<p>So they both went a leasing.</p>\n<p>Titty Mouse leased an ear of corn, and Tatty Mouse leased an ear of</p>\n",

        "<p>Then Tatty sat down and wept; then a three-legged stool said: “Tatty,</p>\n<p>why do you weep?” “Titty's dead,” said Tatty, “and so I weep;” “then,”</p>\n<p>said the stool, “I'll hop,” so the stool hopped.</p>\n<p>Then a broom in the corner of the room said, “Stool, why do you hop?”</p>\n<p>“Oh!” said the stool, “Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and so I hop;”</p>\n<p>“then,” said the broom, “I'll sweep,” so the broom began to sweep.</p>\n<p>“Then,” said the door, “Broom, why do you sweep?” “Oh!” said the broom,</p>\n",
        "<p>“Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and so I sweep;”</p>\n<p>“Then,” said the door, “I'll jar,” so the door jarred.</p>\n<p>“Then,” said the window, “Door, why do you jar?” “Oh!” said the door,</p>\n<p>“Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom</p>\n<p>sweeps, and so I jar.”</p>\n<p>“Then,” said the window, “I'll creak,” so the window creaked.</p>\n<p>Now there</p>\n",
        "<p>was an old form outside the house, and when the window creaked, the form</p>\n<p>said: “Window, why do you creak?” “Oh!” said the window, “Titty's dead,</p>\n<p>and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door</p>\n<p>jars, and so I creak.”</p>\n<p>“Then,” said the old form, “I'll run round the house;” then the old form</p>\n<p>ran round the house.</p>\n<p>Now there was a fine large walnut-tree growing by</p>\n",
        "<p>the cottage, and the tree said to the form: “Form, why do you run round</p>\n<p>the house?” “Oh!” said the form, “Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the</p>\n<p>stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks,</p>\n<p>and so I run round the house.”</p>\n<p>“Then,” said the walnut-tree, “I'll shed my leaves,” so the walnut-tree</p>\n<p>shed all its beautiful green leaves.</p>\n<p>Now there was a little bird perched</p>\n",
        "<p>on one of the boughs of the tree, and when all the leaves fell, it</p>\n<p>said: “Walnut-tree, why do you shed your leaves?” “Oh!” said the tree,</p>\n<p>“Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom sweeps,</p>\n<p>the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round the house,</p>\n<p>and so I shed my leaves.”</p>\n<p>“Then,” said the little bird, “I'll moult all my feathers,” so he</p>\n<p>moulted all his pretty feathers.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now there was a little girl walking</p>\n<p>below, carrying a jug of milk for her brothers and sisters' supper,</p>\n<p>and when she saw the poor little bird moult all its feathers, she said:</p>\n<p>“Little bird, why do you moult all your feathers?” “Oh!” said the little</p>\n<p>bird, “Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom</p>\n<p>sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round</p>\n<p>the house, the walnut-tree sheds its leaves, and so I moult all my</p>\n",

        "<p>upset the old form and house, and the house falling knocked the window</p>\n<p>out, and the window knocked the door down, and the door upset the broom,</p>\n<p>and the broom upset the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse was buried</p>\n<p>beneath the ruins.</p>\n<h3>JACK AND HIS GOLDEN SNUFF-BOX</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it was neither in</p>\n<p>my time nor in your time nor in any one else's time, there was an old</p>\n",
        "<p>man and an old woman, and they had one son, and they lived in a great</p>\n<p>forest.</p>\n<p>And their son never saw any other people in his life, but he</p>\n<p>knew that there was some more in the world besides his own father and</p>\n<p>mother, because he had lots of books, and he used to read every day</p>\n<p>about them.</p>\n<p>And when he read about some pretty young women, he used</p>\n",
        "<p>to go mad to see some of them; till one day, when his father was out</p>\n<p>cutting wood, he told his mother that he wished to go away to look for</p>\n<p>his living in some other country, and to see some other people besides</p>\n<p>them two.</p>\n<p>And he said, “I see nothing at all here but great trees around</p>\n<p>me; and if I stay here, maybe I shall go mad before I see anything.” The</p>\n<p>young man's father was out all this time, when this talk was going on</p>\n",
        "<p>between him and his poor old mother.</p>\n<p>The old woman begins by saying to her son before leaving, “Well, well,</p>\n<p>my poor boy, if you want to go, it's better for you to go, and God</p>\n<p>be with you.”--(The old woman thought for the best when she said</p>\n<p>that.)--“But stop a bit before you go.</p>\n<p>Which would you like best for me</p>\n<p>to make you, a little cake and bless you, or a big cake and curse you?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Dear, dear!” said he, “make me a big cake.</p>\n<p>Maybe I shall be hungry on</p>\n<p>the road.” The old woman made the big cake, and she went on top of the</p>\n<p>house, and she cursed him as far as she could see him.</p>\n<p>He presently meets with his father, and the old man says to him: “Where</p>\n<p>are you going, my poor boy?” when the son told the father the same tale</p>\n<p>as he told his mother.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well,” says his father, “I'm sorry to see you</p>\n<p>going away, but if you've made your mind to go, it's better for you to</p>\n<p>go.”</p>\n<p>The poor lad had not gone far, when his father called him back; then</p>\n<p>the old man drew out of his pocket a golden snuff-box, and said to him:</p>\n<p>“Here, take this little box, and put it in your pocket, and be sure not</p>\n<p>to open it till you are near your death.” And away went poor Jack upon</p>\n",
        "<p>his road, and walked till he was tired and hungry, for he had eaten all</p>\n<p>his cake upon the road; and by this time night was upon him, so he could</p>\n<p>hardly see his way before him.</p>\n<p>He could see some light a long way before</p>\n<p>him, and he made up to it, and found the back door and knocked at it,</p>\n<p>till one of the maid-servants came and asked him what he wanted.</p>\n<p>He said</p>\n",
        "<p>that night was on him, and he wanted to get some place to sleep.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>maid-servant called him in to the fire, and gave him plenty to eat,</p>\n<p>good meat and bread and beer; and as he was eating his food by the fire,</p>\n<p>there came the young lady to look at him, and she loved him well and he</p>\n<p>loved her.</p>\n<p>And the young lady ran to tell her father, and said there was</p>\n",
        "<p>a pretty young man in the back kitchen; and immediately the gentleman</p>\n<p>came to him, and questioned him, and asked what work he could do.</p>\n<p>Jack</p>\n<p>said, the silly fellow, that he could do anything.</p>\n<p>(He meant that he</p>\n<p>could do any foolish bit of work, that would be wanted about the house.)</p>\n<p>“Well,” says the gentleman to him, “if you can do anything, at eight</p>\n",
        "<p>o'clock in the morning I must have a great lake and some of-the largest</p>\n<p>man-of-war vessels sailing before my mansion, and one of the largest</p>\n<p>vessels must fire a royal salute, and the last round must break the</p>\n<p>leg of the bed where my young daughter is sleeping.</p>\n<p>And if you don't do</p>\n<p>that, you will have to forfeit your life.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said Jack; and away he went to his bed, and said his</p>\n",
        "<p>prayers quietly, and slept till it was near eight o'clock, and he had</p>\n<p>hardly any time to think what he was to do, till all of a sudden he</p>\n<p>remembered about the little golden box that his father gave him.</p>\n<p>And he</p>\n<p>said to himself: “Well, well, I never was so near my death as I am now;”</p>\n<p>and then he felt in his pocket, and drew the little box out.</p>\n<p>And when he</p>\n",
        "<p>opened it, out there hopped three little red men, and asked Jack: “What</p>\n<p>is your will with us?” “Well,” said Jack, “I want a great lake and some</p>\n<p>of the largest man-of-war vessels in the world before this mansion, and</p>\n<p>one of the largest vessels to fire a royal salute, and the last round</p>\n<p>to break one of the legs of the bed where this young lady is sleeping.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said the little men; “go to sleep.”</p>\n<p>Jack had hardly time to bring the words out of his mouth, to tell the</p>\n",
        "<p>little men what to do, but what it struck eight o'clock, when Bang, bang</p>\n<p>went one of the largest man-of-war vessels; and it made Jack jump out of</p>\n<p>bed to look through the window; and I can assure you it was a wonderful</p>\n<p>sight for him to see, after being so long with his father and mother</p>\n<p>living in a wood.</p>\n<p>By this time Jack dressed himself, and said his prayers, and came down</p>\n<p>laughing; for he was proud, he was, because the thing was done so well.</p>\n",
        "<p>The gentleman comes to him, and says to him: “Well, my young man, I must</p>\n<p>say that you are very clever indeed.</p>\n<p>Come and have some breakfast.” And</p>\n<p>the gentleman tells him, “Now there are two more things you have to</p>\n<p>do, and then you shall have my daughter in marriage.” Jack gets his</p>\n<p>breakfast, and has a good squint at the young lady, and also she at him.</p>\n<p>The other thing that the gentleman told him to do was to fell all the</p>\n",
        "<p>great trees for miles around by eight o'clock in the morning; and, to</p>\n<p>make my long story short, it was done, and it pleased the gentleman well</p>\n<p>The gentleman said to him: “The other thing you have to do”--(and it</p>\n<p>was the last thing)--“you must get me a great castle standing on twelve</p>\n<p>golden pillars; and there must come regiments of soldiers and go through</p>\n<p>their drill.</p>\n<p>At eight o'clock the commanding officer must say, 'Shoulder</p>\n",
        "<p>up.'” “All right,” said Jack; when the third and last morning came</p>\n<p>the third great feat was finished, and he had the young daughter in</p>\n<p>marriage.</p>\n<p>But, oh dear!</p>\n<p>there is worse to come yet.</p>\n<p>The gentleman now makes a large hunting party, and invites all the</p>\n<p>gentlemen around the country to it, and to see the castle as well.</p>\n",
        "<p>And</p>\n<p>by this time Jack has a beautiful horse and a scarlet dress to go with</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n<p>On that morning his valet, when putting Jack's clothes by,</p>\n<p>after changing them to go a hunting, put his hand in one of Jack's</p>\n<p>waistcoat-pockets, and pulled out the little golden snuffbox, as poor</p>\n<p>Jack left behind in a mistake.</p>\n",
        "<p>And that man opened the little box, and</p>\n<p>there hopped the three little red men out, and asked him what he wanted</p>\n<p>with them.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the valet to them, “I want this castle to be</p>\n<p>moved from this place far and far across the sea.” “All right,” said</p>\n<p>the little red men to him; “do you wish to go with it?” “Yes,” said he.</p>\n<p>“Well, get up,” said they to him; and away they went far and far over</p>\n",
        "<p>the great sea.</p>\n<p>Now the grand hunting party comes back, and the castle upon the twelve</p>\n<p>golden pillars had disappeared, to the great disappointment of those</p>\n<p>gentlemen as did not see it before.</p>\n<p>That poor silly Jack is threatened</p>\n<p>by taking his beautiful young wife from him, for taking them in in the</p>\n<p>way he did.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the gentleman at last made an agreement with him, and he</p>\n<p>is to have a twelvemonths and a day to look for it; and off he goes with</p>\n<p>a good horse and money in his pocket.</p>\n<p>Now poor Jack goes in search of his missing castle, over hills, dales,</p>\n<p>valleys, and mountains, through woolly woods and sheepwalks, further</p>\n<p>than I can tell you or ever intend to tell you.</p>\n<p>Until at last he comes</p>\n",
        "<p>up to the place where lives the King of all the little mice in the</p>\n<p>world.</p>\n<p>There was one of the little mice on sentry at the front gate</p>\n<p>going up to the palace, and did try to stop Jack from going in.</p>\n<p>He asked</p>\n<p>the little mouse: “Where does the King live?</p>\n<p>I should like to see him.”</p>\n",
        "<p>This one sent another with him to show him the place; and when the King</p>\n<p>saw him, he called him in.</p>\n<p>And the King questioned him, and asked him</p>\n<p>where he was going that way.</p>\n<p>Well, Jack told him all the truth, that he</p>\n<p>had lost the great castle, and was going to look for it, and he had a</p>\n<p>whole twelvemonths and a day to find it out.</p>\n",
        "<p>And Jack asked him whether</p>\n<p>he knew anything about it; and the King said: “No, but I am the King</p>\n<p>of all the little mice in the world, and I will call them all up in the</p>\n<p>morning, and maybe they have seen something of it.”</p>\n<p>Then Jack got a good meal and bed, and in the morning he and the King</p>\n<p>went on to the fields; and the King called all the mice together, and</p>\n<p>asked them whether they had seen the great beautiful castle standing on</p>\n",
        "<p>golden pillars.</p>\n<p>And all the little mice said, No, there was none of them</p>\n<p>had seen it.</p>\n<p>The old King said to him that he had two other brothers:</p>\n<p>“One is the King of all the frogs; and my other brother, who is the</p>\n<p>oldest, he is the King of all the birds in the world.</p>\n<p>And if you go</p>\n",
        "<p>there, may be they know something about the missing castle.” The King</p>\n<p>said to him: “Leave your horse here with me till you come back, and take</p>\n<p>one of my best horses under you, and give this cake to my brother; he</p>\n<p>will know then who you got it from.</p>\n<p>Mind and tell him I am well, and</p>\n<p>should like dearly to see him.” And then the King and Jack shook hands</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when Jack was going through the gates, the little mouse asked him,</p>\n<p>should he go with him; and Jack said to him: “No, I shall get myself</p>\n<p>into trouble with the King.” And the little thing told him: “It will be</p>\n<p>better for you to let me go with you; maybe I shall do some good to you</p>\n<p>some time without you knowing it.” “Jump up, then.” And the little mouse</p>\n<p>ran up the horse's leg, and made it dance; and Jack put the mouse in his</p>\n<p>pocket.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now Jack, after wishing good morning to the King and pocketing the</p>\n<p>little mouse which was on sentry, trudged on his way; and such a long</p>\n<p>way he had to go and this was his first day.</p>\n<p>At last he found the place;</p>\n<p>and there was one of the frogs on sentry, and gun upon his shoulder, and</p>\n<p>did try to hinder Jack from going in; but when Jack said to him that he</p>\n<p>wanted to see the King, he allowed him to pass; and Jack made up to the</p>\n",
        "<p>door.</p>\n<p>The King came out, and asked him his business; and Jack told</p>\n<p>him all from beginning to end.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, come in.” He gets good</p>\n<p>entertainment that night; and in the morning the King made such a funny</p>\n<p>sound, and collected all the frogs in the world.</p>\n<p>And he asked them,</p>\n",
        "<p>did they know or see anything of a castle that stood upon twelve golden</p>\n<p>pillars; and they all made a curious sound, _Kro-kro, kro-kro_, and</p>\n<p>said, No.</p>\n<p>Jack had to take another horse, and a cake to this King's brother, who</p>\n<p>is the King of all the fowls of the air; and as Jack was going through</p>\n<p>the gates, the little frog that was on sentry asked John should he go</p>\n<p>with him.</p>\n",
        "<p>Jack refused him for a bit; but at last he told him to jump</p>\n<p>up, and Jack put him in his other waistcoat pocket.</p>\n<p>And away he went</p>\n<p>again on his great long journey; it was three times as long this time as</p>\n<p>it was the first day; however, he found the place, and there was a fine</p>\n<p>bird on sentry.</p>\n<p>And Jack passed him, and he never said a word to him;</p>\n",
        "<p>and he talked with the King, and told him everything, all about the</p>\n<p>castle.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the King to him, “you shall know in the morning</p>\n<p>from my birds, whether they know anything or not.” Jack put up his horse</p>\n<p>in the stable, and then went to bed, after having something to eat.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when he got up in the morning the King and he went on to some field, and</p>\n",
        "<p>there the King made some funny noise, and there came all the fowls that</p>\n<p>were in all the world.</p>\n<p>And the King asked them; “Did they see the fine</p>\n<p>castle?” and all the birds answered, No.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the King, “where</p>\n<p>is the great bird?” They had to wait then for a long time for the eagle</p>\n<p>to make his appearance, when at last he came all in a perspiration,</p>\n",
        "<p>after sending two little birds high up in the sky to whistle on him to</p>\n<p>make all the haste he possibly could.</p>\n<p>The King asked the great bird,</p>\n<p>Did he see the great castle?</p>\n<p>and the bird said: “Yes, I came from there</p>\n<p>where it now is.” “Well,” says the King to him; “this young gentleman</p>\n<p>has lost it, and you must go with him back to it; but stop till you get</p>\n",
        "<p>a bit of something to eat first.”</p>\n<p>They killed a thief, and sent the best part of it to feed the eagle on</p>\n<p>his journey over the seas, and had to carry Jack on his back.</p>\n<p>Now when</p>\n<p>they came in sight of the castle, they did not know what to do to get</p>\n<p>the little golden box.</p>\n<p>Well, the little mouse said to them: “Leave me</p>\n",
        "<p>down, and I will get the little box for you.” So the mouse stole into</p>\n<p>the castle, and got hold of the box; and when he was coming down the</p>\n<p>stairs, it fell down, and he was very near being caught.</p>\n<p>He came running</p>\n<p>out with it, laughing his best.</p>\n<p>“Have you got it?” Jack said to him; he</p>\n<p>said: “Yes;” and off they went back again, and left the castle behind.</p>\n",
        "<p>As they were all of them (Jack, mouse, frog, and eagle) passing over</p>\n<p>the great sea, they fell to quarrelling about which it was that got the</p>\n<p>little box, till down it slipped into the water.</p>\n<p>(It was by them looking</p>\n<p>at it and handing it from one hand to the other that they dropped the</p>\n<p>little box to the bottom of the sea.) “Well, well,” said the frog, “I</p>\n<p>knew that I would have to do something, so you had better let me go down</p>\n",
        "<p>in the water.” And they let him go, and he was down for three days and</p>\n<p>three nights; and up he comes, and shows his nose and little mouth out</p>\n<p>of the water; and all of them asked him, Did he get it?</p>\n<p>and he told</p>\n<p>them, No.</p>\n<p>“Well, what are you doing there, then?” “Nothing at all,” he</p>\n<p>said, “only I want my full breath;” and the poor little frog went down</p>\n",
        "<p>the second time, and he was down for a day and a night, and up he brings</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>And away they did go, after being there four days and nights; and after</p>\n<p>a long tug over seas and mountains, arrive at the palace of the old</p>\n<p>King, who is the master of all the birds in the world.</p>\n<p>And the King</p>\n<p>is very proud to see them, and has a hearty welcome and a long</p>\n",
        "<p>conversation.</p>\n<p>Jack opens the little box, and told the little men to go</p>\n<p>back and to bring the castle here to them; “and all of you make as much</p>\n<p>haste back again as you possibly can.”</p>\n<p>The three little men went off; and when they came near the castle they</p>\n<p>were afraid to go to it till the gentleman and lady and all the servants</p>\n<p>were gone out to some dance.</p>\n",
        "<p>And there was no one left behind there only</p>\n<p>the cook and another maid with her; and the little red men asked them</p>\n<p>which would they rather--go, or stop behind?</p>\n<p>and they both said: “I will</p>\n<p>go with you;” and the little men told them to run upstairs quick.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>were no sooner up and in one of the drawing-rooms than here comes just</p>\n",
        "<p>in sight the gentleman and lady and all the servants; but it was too</p>\n<p>late.</p>\n<p>Off the castle went at full speed, with the women laughing at them</p>\n<p>through the window, while they made motions for them to stop, but all to</p>\n<p>no purpose.</p>\n<p>They were nine days on their journey, in which they did try to keep the</p>\n<p>Sunday holy, when one of the little men turned to be the priest, the</p>\n",
        "<p>other the clerk, and third presided at the organ, and the women were</p>\n<p>the singers, for they had a grand chapel in the castle already.</p>\n<p>Very</p>\n<p>remarkable, there was a discord made in the music, and one of the little</p>\n<p>men ran up one of the organ-pipes to see where the bad sound came</p>\n<p>from, when he found out it only happened to be that the two women were</p>\n<p>laughing at the little red man stretching his little legs full length</p>\n",
        "<p>on the bass pipes, also his two arms the same time, with his little red</p>\n<p>night-cap, which he never forgot to wear, and what they never witnessed</p>\n<p>before, could not help calling forth some good merriment while on the</p>\n<p>face of the deep.</p>\n<p>And poor thing!</p>\n<p>through them not going on with what</p>\n<p>they begun with, they very near came to danger, as the castle was once</p>\n",
        "<p>very near sinking in the middle of the sea.</p>\n<p>At length, after a merry journey, they come again to Jack and the King.</p>\n<p>The King was quite struck with the sight of the castle; and going up the</p>\n<p>golden stairs, went to see the inside.</p>\n<p>The King was very much pleased with the castle, but poor Jack's time of</p>\n<p>a twelvemonths and a day was drawing to a close; and he, wishing to</p>\n<p>go home to his young wife, gives orders to the three little men to</p>\n",
        "<p>get ready by the next morning at eight o'clock to be off to the next</p>\n<p>brother, and to stop there for one night; also to proceed from there</p>\n<p>to the last or the youngest brother, the master of all the mice in the</p>\n<p>world, in such place where the castle shall be left under his care until</p>\n<p>it's sent for.</p>\n<p>Jack takes a farewell of the King, and thanks him very</p>\n<p>much for his hospitality.</p>\n",
        "<p>Away went Jack and his castle again, and stopped one night in that</p>\n<p>place; and away they went again to the third place, and there left the</p>\n<p>castle under his care.</p>\n<p>As Jack had to leave the castle behind, he had to</p>\n<p>take to his own horse, which he left there when he first started.</p>\n<p>Now poor Jack leaves his castle behind and faces towards home; and</p>\n<p>after having so much merriment with the three brothers every night, Jack</p>\n",
        "<p>became sleepy on horseback, and would have lost the road if it was not</p>\n<p>for the little men a-guiding him.</p>\n<p>At last he arrived weary and tired,</p>\n<p>and they did not seem to receive him with any kindness whatever,</p>\n<p>because he had not found the stolen castle; and to make it worse, he was</p>\n<p>disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet</p>\n<p>him, through being hindered by her parents.</p>\n",
        "<p>But that did not stop long.</p>\n<p>Jack put full power on and despatched the little men off to bring the</p>\n<p>castle from there, and they soon got there.</p>\n<p>Jack shook hands with the King, and returned many thanks for his kingly</p>\n<p>kindness in minding the castle for him; and then Jack instructed the</p>\n<p>little men to spur up and put speed on.</p>\n<p>And off they went, and were not</p>\n",
        "<p>long before they reached their journey's end, when out comes the young</p>\n<p>wife to meet him with a fine lump of a young SON, and they all lived</p>\n<p>happy ever afterwards.</p>\n<h3>THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time there were Three Bears, who lived together in a house</p>\n<p>of their own, in a wood.</p>\n<p>One of them was a Little, Small Wee Bear; and</p>\n",
        "<p>one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great, Huge Bear.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>had each a pot for their porridge, a little pot for the Little, Small,</p>\n<p>Wee Bear; and a middle-sized pot for the Middle Bear, and a great pot</p>\n<p>for the Great, Huge Bear.</p>\n<p>And they had each a chair to sit in; a little</p>\n<p>chair for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized chair for the</p>\n",
        "<p>Middle Bear; and a great chair for the Great, Huge Bear.</p>\n<p>And they had</p>\n<p>each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little, Small, Wee Bear;</p>\n<p>and a middle-sized bed for the Middle Bear; and a great bed for the</p>\n<p>Great, Huge Bear.</p>\n<p>One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and</p>\n<p>poured it into their porridge-pots, they walked out into the wood while</p>\n",
        "<p>the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths, by</p>\n<p>beginning too soon to eat it.</p>\n<p>And while they were walking, a little</p>\n<p>old Woman came to the house.</p>\n<p>She could not have been a good, honest old</p>\n<p>Woman; for first she looked in at the window, and then she peeped in at</p>\n<p>the keyhole; and seeing nobody in the house, she lifted the latch.</p>\n",
        "<p>The</p>\n<p>door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did nobody</p>\n<p>any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them.</p>\n<p>So the</p>\n<p>little old Woman opened the door, and went in; and well pleased she was</p>\n<p>when she saw the porridge on the table.</p>\n<p>If she had been a good little</p>\n",
        "<p>old Woman, she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then,</p>\n<p>perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good</p>\n<p>Bears--a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all</p>\n<p>that very good-natured and hospitable.</p>\n<p>But she was an impudent, bad old</p>\n<p>Woman, and set about helping herself.</p>\n<p>So first she tasted the porridge of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was</p>\n",
        "<p>too hot for her; and she said a bad word about that.</p>\n<p>And then she tasted</p>\n<p>the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold for her; and she</p>\n<p>said a bad word about that too.</p>\n<p>And then she went to the porridge of the</p>\n<p>Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that; and that was neither too hot,</p>\n<p>nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so well, that she ate</p>\n",
        "<p>it all up: but the naughty old Woman said a bad word about the little</p>\n<p>porridge-pot, because it did not hold enough for her.</p>\n<p>Then the little old Woman sate down in the chair of the Great, Huge</p>\n<p>Bear, and that was too hard for her.</p>\n<p>And then she sate down in the chair</p>\n<p>of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her.</p>\n<p>And then she sate</p>\n",
        "<p>down in the chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was neither</p>\n<p>too hard, nor too soft, but just right.</p>\n<p>So she seated herself in it, and</p>\n<p>there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came,</p>\n<p>plump upon the ground.</p>\n<p>And the naughty old Woman said a wicked word</p>\n<p>about that too.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the little old Woman went upstairs into the bed-chamber in which</p>\n<p>the three Bears slept.</p>\n<p>And first she lay down upon the bed of the Great,</p>\n<p>Huge Bear; but that was too high at the head for her.</p>\n<p>And next she lay</p>\n<p>down upon the bed of the Middle Bear; and that was too high at the foot</p>\n<p>for her.</p>\n",
        "<p>And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little, Small, Wee</p>\n<p>Bear; and that was neither too high at the head, nor at the foot, but</p>\n<p>just right.</p>\n<p>So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there till</p>\n<p>she fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool</p>\n<p>enough; so they came home to breakfast.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now the little old Woman had</p>\n<p>left the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear, standing in his porridge.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been at my porridge!”</p>\n<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.</p>\n<p>And when</p>\n<p>the Middle Bear looked at his, he saw that the spoon was standing in it</p>\n<p>too.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were wooden spoons; if they had been silver ones, the naughty</p>\n<p>old Woman would have put them in her pocket.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been at my porridge!”</p>\n<p>said the Middle Bear in his middle voice.</p>\n<p>Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon</p>\n<p>in the porridge-pot, but the porridge was all gone.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!”</p>\n",
        "<p>said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.</p>\n<p>Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house,</p>\n<p>and eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look</p>\n<p>about them.</p>\n<p>Now the little old Woman had not put the hard cushion</p>\n<p>straight when she rose from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been sitting in my chair!”</p>\n",
        "<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.</p>\n<p>And the little old Woman had squatted down the soft cushion of the</p>\n<p>Middle Bear.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been sitting in my chair!”</p>\n<p>said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.</p>\n<p>And you know what the little old Woman had done to the third chair.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been sitting in my chair and has sate the bottom out of</p>\n",
        "<p>it!”</p>\n<p>said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.</p>\n<p>Then the Three Bears thought it necessary that they should make farther</p>\n<p>search; so they went upstairs into their bedchamber.</p>\n<p>Now the little old</p>\n<p>Woman had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear, out of its place.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been lying in my bed!”</p>\n",
        "<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.</p>\n<p>And the little old Woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle Bear out</p>\n<p>of its place.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been lying in my bed!”</p>\n<p>said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.</p>\n<p>And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was</p>\n<p>the bolster in its place; and the pillow in its place upon the bolster;</p>\n",
        "<p>and upon the pillow was the little old Woman's ugly, dirty head,--which</p>\n<p>was not in its place, for she had no business there.</p>\n<p>“Somebody has been lying in my bed,--and here she is!”</p>\n<p>said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.</p>\n<p>The little old Woman had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff</p>\n<p>voice of the Great, Huge Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was</p>\n<p>no more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder.</p>\n",
        "<p>And</p>\n<p>she had heard the middle voice, of the Middle Bear, but it was only as</p>\n<p>if she had heard some one speaking in a dream.</p>\n<p>But when she heard the</p>\n<p>little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was so</p>\n<p>sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once.</p>\n<p>Up she started; and</p>\n",
        "<p>when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself</p>\n<p>out at the other, and ran to the window.</p>\n<p>Now the window was open,</p>\n<p>because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened</p>\n<p>their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning.</p>\n<p>Out the little</p>\n<p>old Woman jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall; or ran</p>\n",
        "<p>into the wood and was lost there; or found her way out of the wood, and</p>\n<p>was taken up by the constable and sent to the House of Correction for</p>\n<p>a vagrant as she was, I cannot tell.</p>\n<p>But the Three Bears never saw</p>\n<p>anything more of her.</p>\n<h3>JACK THE GIANT-KILLER</h3>\n<p>When good King Arthur reigned, there lived near the Land's End of</p>\n",
        "<p>England, in the county of Cornwall, a farmer who had one only son called</p>\n<p>Jack.</p>\n<p>He was brisk and of a ready lively wit, so that nobody or nothing</p>\n<p>could worst him.</p>\n<p>In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge giant named</p>\n<p>Cormoran.</p>\n<p>He was eighteen feet in height, and about three yards round</p>\n",
        "<p>the waist, of a fierce and grim countenance, the terror of all the</p>\n<p>neighbouring towns and villages.</p>\n<p>He lived in a cave in the midst of the</p>\n<p>Mount, and whenever he wanted food he would wade over to the main-land,</p>\n<p>where he would furnish himself with whatever came in his way.</p>\n<p>Everybody</p>\n<p>at his approach ran out of their houses, while he seized on their</p>\n",
        "<p>cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen on his back at a</p>\n<p>time; and as for their sheep and hogs, he would tie them round his waist</p>\n<p>like a bunch of tallow-dips.</p>\n<p>He had done this for many years, so that</p>\n<p>all Cornwall was in despair.</p>\n<p>One day Jack happened to be at the town-hall when the magistrates were</p>\n<p>sitting in council about the Giant.</p>\n",
        "<p>He asked: “What reward will be given</p>\n<p>to the man who kills Cormoran?” “The giant's treasure,” they said, “will</p>\n<p>be the reward.” Quoth Jack: “Then let me undertake it.”</p>\n<p>So he got a horn, shovel, and pickaxe, and went over to the Mount in the</p>\n<p>beginning of a dark winter's evening, when he fell to work, and before</p>\n<p>morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep, and nearly as broad,</p>\n<p>covering it over with long sticks and straw.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he strewed a little</p>\n<p>mould over it, so that it appeared like plain ground.</p>\n<p>Jack then placed</p>\n<p>himself on the opposite side of the pit, farthest from the giant's</p>\n<p>lodging, and, just at the break of day, he put the horn to his mouth,</p>\n<p>and blew, Tantivy, Tantivy.</p>\n<p>This noise roused the giant, who rushed</p>\n",
        "<p>from his cave, crying: “You incorrigible villain, are you come here</p>\n<p>to disturb my rest?</p>\n<p>You shall pay dearly for this.</p>\n<p>Satisfaction I will</p>\n<p>have, and this it shall be, I will take you whole and broil you for</p>\n<p>breakfast.” He had no sooner uttered this, than he tumbled into the pit,</p>\n<p>and made the very foundations of the Mount to shake.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh, Giant,” quoth</p>\n<p>Jack, “where are you now?</p>\n<p>Oh, faith, you are gotten now into Lob's</p>\n<p>Pound, where I will surely plague you for your threatening words: what</p>\n<p>do you think now of broiling me for your breakfast?</p>\n<p>Will no other diet</p>\n<p>serve you but poor Jack?” Then having tantalised the giant for a while,</p>\n",
        "<p>he gave him a most weighty knock with his pickaxe on the very crown of</p>\n<p>his head, and killed him on the spot.</p>\n<p>Jack then filled up the pit with earth, and went to search the cave,</p>\n<p>which he found contained much treasure.</p>\n<p>When the magistrates heard of</p>\n<p>this they made a declaration he should henceforth be termed</p>\n<h3>JACK THE GIANT-KILLER</h3>\n",
        "<p>and presented him with a sword and a belt, on which were written these</p>\n<p>words embroidered in letters of gold:</p>\n<p>“Here's the right valiant Cornish man,</p>\n<p>Who slew the giant Cormoran.”</p>\n<p>The news of Jack's victory soon spread over all the West of England,</p>\n<p>so that another giant, named Blunderbore, hearing of it, vowed to be</p>\n<p>revenged on Jack, if ever he should light on him.</p>\n",
        "<p>This giant was the</p>\n<p>lord of an enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lonesome wood.</p>\n<p>Now Jack, about four months afterwards, walking near this wood in his</p>\n<p>journey to Wales, being weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain</p>\n<p>and fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>While he was sleeping, the giant, coming there</p>\n<p>for water, discovered him, and knew him to be the far-famed Jack the</p>\n",
        "<p>Giant-killer by the lines written on the belt.</p>\n<p>Without ado, he took Jack</p>\n<p>on his shoulders and carried him towards his castle.</p>\n<p>Now, as they passed</p>\n<p>through a thicket, the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack, who was</p>\n<p>strangely surprised to find himself in the clutches of the giant.</p>\n<p>His</p>\n",
        "<p>terror was only begun, for, on entering the castle, he saw the ground</p>\n<p>strewed with human bones, and the giant told him his own would ere</p>\n<p>long be among them.</p>\n<p>After this the giant locked poor Jack in an immense</p>\n<p>chamber, leaving him there while he went to fetch another giant, his</p>\n<p>brother, living in the same wood, who might share in the meal on Jack.</p>\n<p>After waiting some time Jack, on going to the window beheld afar off the</p>\n",
        "<p>two giants coming towards the castle.</p>\n<p>“Now,” quoth Jack to himself, “my</p>\n<p>death or my deliverance is at hand.” Now, there were strong cords in a</p>\n<p>corner of the room in which Jack was, and two of these he took, and made</p>\n<p>a strong noose at the end; and while the giants were unlocking the iron</p>\n<p>gate of the castle he threw the ropes over each of their heads.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n",
        "<p>he drew the other ends across a beam, and pulled with all his might, so</p>\n<p>that he throttled them.</p>\n<p>Then, when he saw they were black in the face,</p>\n<p>he slid down the rope, and drawing his sword, slew them both.</p>\n<p>Then,</p>\n<p>taking the giant's keys, and unlocking the rooms, he found three fair</p>\n<p>ladies tied by the hair of their heads, almost starved to death.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Sweet</p>\n<p>ladies,” quoth Jack, “I have destroyed this monster and his brutish</p>\n<p>brother, and obtained your liberties.” This said he presented them with</p>\n<p>the keys, and so proceeded on his journey to Wales.</p>\n<p>Jack made the best of his way by travelling as fast as he could, but</p>\n<p>lost his road, and was benighted, and could find any habitation until,</p>\n<p>coming into a narrow valley, he found a large house, and in order to</p>\n",
        "<p>get shelter took courage to knock at the gate.</p>\n<p>But what was his surprise</p>\n<p>when there came forth a monstrous giant with two heads; yet he did not</p>\n<p>appear so fiery as the others were, for he was a Welsh giant, and</p>\n<p>what he did was by private and secret malice under the false show of</p>\n<p>friendship.</p>\n<p>Jack, having told his condition to the giant, was shown into</p>\n",
        "<p>a bedroom, where, in the dead of night, he heard his host in another</p>\n<p>apartment muttering these words:</p>\n<p>“Though here you lodge with me this night,</p>\n<p>You shall not see the morning light</p>\n<p>My club shall dash your brains outright!”</p>\n<p>“Say'st thou so,” quoth Jack; “that is like one of your Welsh tricks,</p>\n<p>yet I hope to be cunning enough for you.” Then, getting out of bed, he</p>\n",
        "<p>laid a billet in the bed in his stead, and hid himself in a corner of</p>\n<p>the room.</p>\n<p>At the dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who</p>\n<p>struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club, thinking he had</p>\n<p>broken every bone in Jack's skin.</p>\n<p>The next morning Jack, laughing in his</p>\n<p>sleeve, gave him hearty thanks for his night's lodging.</p>\n",
        "<p>“How have you</p>\n<p>rested?” quoth the giant; “did you not feel anything in the night?”</p>\n<p>“No,” quoth Jack, “nothing but a rat, which gave me two or three slaps</p>\n<p>with her tail.” With that, greatly wondering, the giant led Jack to</p>\n<p>breakfast, bringing him a bowl containing four gallons of hasty pudding.</p>\n<p>Being loth to let the giant think it too much for him, Jack put a large</p>\n<p>leather bag under his loose coat, in such a way that he could convey the</p>\n",
        "<p>pudding into it without its being perceived.</p>\n<p>Then, telling the giant he</p>\n<p>would show him a trick, taking a knife, Jack ripped open the bag, and</p>\n<p>out came all the hasty pudding.</p>\n<p>Whereupon, saying, “Odds splutters hur</p>\n<p>nails, hur can do that trick hurself,” the monster took the knife, and</p>\n<p>ripping open his belly, fell down dead.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now, it happened in these days that King Arthur's only son asked his</p>\n<p>father to give him a large sum of money, in order that he might go and</p>\n<p>seek his fortune in the principality of Wales, where lived a beautiful</p>\n<p>lady possessed with seven evil spirits.</p>\n<p>The king did his best to</p>\n<p>persuade his son from it, but in vain; so at last gave way and the</p>\n<p>prince set out with two horses, one loaded with money, the other for</p>\n",
        "<p>himself to ride upon.</p>\n<p>Now, after several days' travel, he came to a</p>\n<p>market-town in Wales, where he beheld a vast crowd of people gathered</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n<p>The prince asked the reason of it, and was told that they had</p>\n<p>arrested a corpse for several large sums of money which the deceased</p>\n<p>owed when he died.</p>\n",
        "<p>The prince replied that it was a pity creditors</p>\n<p>should be so cruel, and said: “Go bury the dead, and let his creditors</p>\n<p>come to my lodging, and there their debts shall be paid.” They came,</p>\n<p>in such great numbers that before night he had only twopence left for</p>\n<p>himself.</p>\n<p>Now Jack the Giant-Killer, coming that way, was so taken with the</p>\n<p>generosity of the prince, that he desired to be his servant.</p>\n",
        "<p>This</p>\n<p>being agreed upon, the next morning they set forward on their journey</p>\n<p>together, when, as they were riding out of the town, an old woman called</p>\n<p>after the prince, saying, “He has owed me twopence these seven years;</p>\n<p>pray pay me as well as the rest.” Putting his hand to his pocket, the</p>\n<p>prince gave the woman all he had left, so that after their day's food,</p>\n<p>which cost what small spell Jack had by him, they were without a penny</p>\n",
        "<p>between them.</p>\n<p>When the sun got low, the king's son said: “Jack, since we have no</p>\n<p>money, where can we lodge this night?”</p>\n<p>But Jack replied: “Master, we'll do well enough, for I have an uncle</p>\n<p>lives within two miles of this place; he is a huge and monstrous giant</p>\n<p>with three heads; he'll fight five hundred men in armour, and make them</p>\n<p>to fly before him.” “Alas!” quoth the prince, “what shall we do there?</p>\n",
        "<p>He'll certainly chop us up at a mouthful.</p>\n<p>Nay, we are scarce enough to</p>\n<p>fill one of his hollow teeth!”</p>\n<p>“It is no matter for that,” quoth Jack; “I myself will go before and</p>\n<p>prepare the way for you; therefore stop here and wait till I return.”</p>\n<p>Jack then rode away at full speed, and coming to the gate of the castle,</p>\n<p>he knocked so loud that he made the neighbouring hills resound.</p>\n",
        "<p>The</p>\n<p>giant roared out at this like thunder: “Who's there?”</p>\n<p>Jack answered: “None but your poor cousin Jack.”</p>\n<p>Quoth he: “What news with my poor cousin Jack?”</p>\n<p>He replied: “Dear uncle, heavy news, God wot!”</p>\n<p>“Prithee,” quoth the giant, “what heavy news can come to me?</p>\n<p>I am</p>\n",
        "<p>a giant with three heads, and besides thou knowest I can fight five</p>\n<p>hundred men in armour, and make them fly like chaff before the wind.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, but,” quoth Jack, “here's the king's son a-coming with a thousand</p>\n<p>men in armour to kill you and destroy all that you have!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, cousin Jack,” said the giant, “this is heavy news indeed!</p>\n<p>I will</p>\n<p>immediately run and hide myself, and thou shalt lock, bolt, and bar</p>\n",
        "<p>me in, and keep the keys until the prince is gone.” Having secured the</p>\n<p>giant, Jack fetched his master, when they made themselves heartily merry</p>\n<p>whilst the poor giant lay trembling in a vault under the ground.</p>\n<p>Early in the morning Jack furnished his master with a fresh supply of</p>\n<p>gold and silver, and then sent him three miles forward on his journey,</p>\n<p>at which time the prince was pretty well out of the smell of the giant.</p>\n<p>Jack then returned, and let the giant out of the vault, who asked what</p>\n",
        "<p>he should give him for keeping the castle from destruction.</p>\n<p>“Why,” quoth</p>\n<p>Jack, “I want nothing but the old coat and cap, together with the old</p>\n<p>rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed's head.” Quoth the giant:</p>\n<p>“You know not what you ask; they are the most precious things I have.</p>\n<p>The coat will keep you invisible, the cap will tell you all you want to</p>\n<p>know, the sword cuts asunder whatever you strike, and the shoes are</p>\n",
        "<p>of extraordinary swiftness.</p>\n<p>But you have been very serviceable to me,</p>\n<p>therefore take them with all my heart.” Jack thanked his uncle, and then</p>\n<p>went off with them.</p>\n<p>He soon overtook his master and they quickly arrived</p>\n<p>at the house of the lady the prince sought, who, finding the prince to</p>\n<p>be a suitor, prepared a splendid banquet for him.</p>\n",
        "<p>After the repast was</p>\n<p>concluded, she told him she had a task for him.</p>\n<p>She wiped his mouth with</p>\n<p>a handkerchief, saying: “You must show me that handkerchief to-morrow</p>\n<p>morning, or else you will lose your head.” With that she put it in</p>\n<p>her bosom.</p>\n<p>The prince went to bed in great sorrow, but Jack's cap of</p>\n",
        "<p>knowledge informed him how it was to be obtained.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the</p>\n<p>night she called upon her familiar spirit to carry her to Lucifer.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>Jack put on his coat of darkness and his shoes of swiftness, and was</p>\n<p>there as soon as she was.</p>\n<p>When she entered the place of the Old One, she</p>\n",
        "<p>gave the handkerchief to old Lucifer, who laid it upon a shelf, whence</p>\n<p>Jack took it and brought it to his master, who showed it to the lady</p>\n<p>next day, and so saved his life.</p>\n<p>On that day, she gave the prince a kiss</p>\n<p>and told him he must show her the lips to-morrow morning that she kissed</p>\n<p>last night, or lose his head.</p>\n<p>“Ah!” he replied, “if you kiss none but mine, I will.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“That is neither here nor there,” said she; “if you do not, death's your</p>\n<p>portion!”</p>\n<p>At midnight she went as before, and was angry with old Lucifer for</p>\n<p>letting the handkerchief go.</p>\n<p>“But now,” quoth she, “I will be too hard</p>\n<p>for the king's son, for I will kiss thee, and he is to show me thy</p>\n<p>lips.” Which she did, and Jack, when she was not standing by, cut off</p>\n",
        "<p>Lucifer's head and brought it under his invisible coat to his master,</p>\n<p>who the next morning pulled it out by the horns before the lady.</p>\n<p>This</p>\n<p>broke the enchantment and the evil spirit left her, and she appeared in</p>\n<p>all her beauty.</p>\n<p>They were married the next morning, and soon after went</p>\n<p>to the court of King Arthur, where Jack for his many great exploits, was</p>\n",
        "<p>made one of the Knights of the Round Table.</p>\n<p>Jack soon went searching for giants again, but he had not ridden far,</p>\n<p>when he saw a cave, near the entrance of which he beheld a giant sitting</p>\n<p>upon a block of timber, with a knotted iron club by his side.</p>\n<p>His goggle</p>\n<p>eyes were like flames of fire, his countenance grim and ugly, and his</p>\n<p>cheeks like a couple of large flitches of bacon, while the bristles of</p>\n",
        "<p>his beard resembled rods of iron wire, and the locks that hung down upon</p>\n<p>his brawny shoulders were like curled snakes or hissing adders.</p>\n<p>Jack</p>\n<p>alighted from his horse, and, putting on the coat of darkness, went up</p>\n<p>close to the giant, and said softly: “Oh!</p>\n<p>are you there?</p>\n<p>It will not</p>\n",
        "<p>be long before I take you fast by the beard.” The giant all this while</p>\n<p>could not see him, on account of his invisible coat, so that Jack,</p>\n<p>coming up close to the monster, struck a blow with his sword at his</p>\n<p>head, but, missing his aim, he cut off the nose instead.</p>\n<p>At this, the</p>\n<p>giant roared like claps of thunder, and began to lay about him with his</p>\n<p>iron club like one stark mad.</p>\n",
        "<p>But Jack, running behind, drove his sword</p>\n<p>up to the hilt in the giant's back, so that he fell down dead.</p>\n<p>This</p>\n<p>done, Jack cut off the giant's head, and sent it, with his brother's</p>\n<p>also, to King Arthur, by a waggoner he hired for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Jack now resolved to enter the giant's cave in search of his treasure,</p>\n<p>and, passing along through a great many windings and turnings, he came</p>\n",
        "<p>at length to a large room paved with freestone, at the upper end of</p>\n<p>which was a boiling caldron, and on the right hand a large table, at</p>\n<p>which the giant used to dine.</p>\n<p>Then he came to a window, barred with</p>\n<p>iron, through which he looked and beheld a vast number of miserable</p>\n<p>captives, who, seeing him, cried out: “Alas!</p>\n<p>young man, art thou come to</p>\n",
        "<p>be one amongst us in this miserable den?”</p>\n<p>“Ay,” quoth Jack, “but pray tell me what is the meaning of your</p>\n<p>captivity?”</p>\n<p>“We are kept here,” said one, “till such time as the giants have a wish</p>\n<p>to feast, and then the fattest among us is slaughtered!</p>\n<p>And many are the</p>\n<p>times they have dined upon murdered men!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Say you so,” quoth Jack, and straightway unlocked the gate and let them</p>\n<p>free, who all rejoiced like condemned men at sight of a pardon.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>searching the giant's coffers, he shared the gold and silver equally</p>\n<p>amongst them and took them to a neighbouring castle, where they all</p>\n<p>feasted and made merry over their deliverance.</p>\n<p>But in the midst of all this mirth a messenger brought news that one</p>\n",
        "<p>Thunderdell, a giant with two heads, having heard of the death of his</p>\n<p>kinsmen, had come from the northern dales to be revenged on Jack, and</p>\n<p>was within a mile of the castle, the country people flying before him</p>\n<p>like chaff.</p>\n<p>But Jack was not a bit daunted, and said: “Let him come!</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>have a tool to pick his teeth; and you, ladies and gentlemen, walk out</p>\n",
        "<p>into the garden, and you shall witness this giant Thunderdell's death</p>\n<p>and destruction.”</p>\n<p>The castle was situated in the midst of a small island surrounded by a</p>\n<p>moat thirty feet deep and twenty feet wide, over which lay a drawbridge.</p>\n<p>So Jack employed men to cut through this bridge on both sides, nearly to</p>\n<p>the middle; and then, dressing himself in his invisible coat, he marched</p>\n<p>against the giant with his sword of sharpness.</p>\n",
        "<p>Although the giant could</p>\n<p>not see Jack, he smelt his approach, and cried out in these words:</p>\n<p>“Fee, fi, fo, fum!</p>\n<p>I smell the blood of an Englishman!</p>\n<p>Be he alive or be he dead,</p>\n<p>I'll grind his bones to make me bread!”</p>\n<p>“Say'st thou so,” said Jack; “then thou art a monstrous miller indeed.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The giant cried out again: “Art thou that villain who killed my kinsmen?</p>\n<p>Then I will tear thee with my teeth, suck thy blood, and grind thy bones</p>\n<p>to powder.”</p>\n<p>“You'll have to catch me first,” quoth Jack, and throwing off his</p>\n<p>invisible coat, so that the giant might see him, and putting on his</p>\n<p>shoes of swiftness, he ran from the giant, who followed like a walking</p>\n<p>castle, so that the very foundations of the earth seemed to shake at</p>\n",
        "<p>every step.</p>\n<p>Jack led him a long dance, in order that the gentlemen and</p>\n<p>ladies might see; and at last to end the matter, ran lightly over the</p>\n<p>drawbridge, the giant, in full speed, pursuing him with his club.</p>\n<p>Then,</p>\n<p>coming to the middle of the bridge, the giant's great weight broke</p>\n<p>it down, and he tumbled headlong into the water, where he rolled and</p>\n",
        "<p>wallowed like a whale.</p>\n<p>Jack, standing by the moat, laughed at him all</p>\n<p>the while; but though the giant foamed to hear him scoff, and plunged</p>\n<p>from place to place in the moat, yet he could not get out to be</p>\n<p>revenged.</p>\n<p>Jack at length got a cart-rope and cast it over the two heads</p>\n<p>of the giant, and drew him ashore by a team of horses, and then cut</p>\n",
        "<p>off both his heads with his sword of sharpness, and sent them to King</p>\n<p>Arthur.</p>\n<p>After some time spent in mirth and pastime, Jack, taking leave of the</p>\n<p>knights and ladies, set out for new adventures.</p>\n<p>Through many woods he</p>\n<p>passed, and came at length to the foot of a high mountain.</p>\n<p>Here, late</p>\n",
        "<p>at night, he found a lonesome house, and knocked at the door, which was</p>\n<p>opened by an aged man with a head as white as snow.</p>\n<p>“Father,” said Jack,</p>\n<p>“can you lodge a benighted traveller that has lost his way?” “Yes,” said</p>\n<p>the old man; “you are right welcome to my poor cottage.” Whereupon Jack</p>\n<p>entered, and down they sat together, and the old man began to speak as</p>\n<p>follows: “Son, I see by your belt you are the great conqueror of giants,</p>\n",
        "<p>and behold, my son, on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle,</p>\n<p>this is kept by a giant named Galligantua, and he by the help of an</p>\n<p>old conjurer, betrays many knights and ladies into his castle, where by</p>\n<p>magic art they are transformed into sundry shapes and forms.</p>\n<p>But above</p>\n<p>all, I grieve for a duke's daughter, whom they fetched from her father's</p>\n<p>garden, carrying her through the air in a burning chariot drawn by fiery</p>\n",
        "<p>dragons, when they secured her within the castle, and transformed her</p>\n<p>into a white hind.</p>\n<p>And though many knights have tried to break the</p>\n<p>enchantment, and work her deliverance, yet no one could accomplish it,</p>\n<p>on account of two dreadful griffins which are placed at the castle gate</p>\n<p>and which destroy every one who comes near.</p>\n<p>But you, my son, may pass</p>\n",
        "<p>by them undiscovered, where on the gates of the castle you will find</p>\n<p>engraven in large letters how the spell may be broken.” Jack gave the</p>\n<p>old man his hand, and promised that in the morning he would venture his</p>\n<p>life to free the lady.</p>\n<p>In the morning Jack arose and put on his invisible coat and magic cap</p>\n<p>and shoes, and prepared himself for the fray.</p>\n<p>Now, when he had reached</p>\n",
        "<p>the top of the mountain he soon discovered the two fiery griffins, but</p>\n<p>passed them without fear, because of his invisible coat.</p>\n<p>When he had got</p>\n<p>beyond them, he found upon the gates of the castle a golden trumpet hung</p>\n<p>by a silver chain, under which these lines were engraved:</p>\n<p>“Whoever shall this trumpet blow,</p>\n<p>Shall soon the giant overthrow,</p>\n",
        "<p>And break the black enchantment straight;</p>\n<p>So all shall be in happy state.”</p>\n<p>Jack had no sooner read this but he blew the trumpet, at which the</p>\n<p>castle trembled to its vast foundations, and the giant and conjurer were</p>\n<p>in horrid confusion, biting their thumbs and tearing their hair, knowing</p>\n<p>their wicked reign was at an end.</p>\n<p>Then the giant stooping to take up</p>\n",
        "<p>his club, Jack at one blow cut off his head; whereupon the conjurer,</p>\n<p>mounting up into the air, was carried away in a whirlwind.</p>\n<p>Then the</p>\n<p>enchantment was broken, and all the lords and ladies who had so long</p>\n<p>been transformed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes,</p>\n<p>and the castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke.</p>\n<p>This being done, the</p>\n",
        "<p>head of Galligantua was likewise, in the usual manner, conveyed to the</p>\n<p>Court of King Arthur, where, the very next day, Jack followed, with the</p>\n<p>knights and ladies who had been delivered.</p>\n<p>Whereupon, as a reward</p>\n<p>for his good services, the king prevailed upon the duke to bestow his</p>\n<p>daughter in marriage on honest Jack.</p>\n<p>So married they were, and the</p>\n",
        "<p>whole kingdom was filled with joy at the wedding.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the king</p>\n<p>bestowed on Jack a noble castle, with a very beautiful estate thereto</p>\n<p>belonging, where he and his lady lived in great joy and happiness all</p>\n<p>the rest of their days.</p>\n<h3>HENNY-PENNY</h3>\n<p>One day Henny-penny was picking up corn in the cornyard</p>\n",
        "<p>when--whack!--something hit her upon the head.</p>\n<p>“Goodness gracious me!”</p>\n<p>said Henny-penny; “the sky's a-going to fall; I must go and tell the</p>\n<p>king.”</p>\n<p>So she went along and she went along and she went along till she met</p>\n<p>Cocky-locky.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going, Henny-penny?” says Cocky-locky.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>I'm going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,” says Henny-penny.</p>\n<p>“May</p>\n<p>I come with you?” says Cocky-locky.</p>\n<p>“Certainly,” says Henny-penny.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>Henny-penny and Cocky-locky went to tell-the king the sky was falling.</p>\n",
        "<p>They went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met</p>\n<p>Ducky-daddles.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going to, Henny-penny and Cocky-locky?”</p>\n<p>says Ducky-daddles.</p>\n<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>we're going to tell the king the sky's</p>\n<p>a-falling,” said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky.</p>\n",
        "<p>“May I come with you?”</p>\n<p>says Ducky-daddles.</p>\n<p>“Certainly,” said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles went to tell the king the sky</p>\n<p>was a-falling.</p>\n<p>So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they</p>\n",
        "<p>met Goosey-poosey, “Where are you going to, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and</p>\n<p>Ducky-daddles?” said Goosey-poosey.</p>\n<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>we're going to tell the</p>\n<p>king the sky's a-falling,” said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky and</p>\n<p>Ducky-daddles.</p>\n<p>“May I come with you,” said Goosey-poosey.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Certainly,”</p>\n<p>said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles.</p>\n<p>So Henny-penny,</p>\n<p>Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey went to tell the king the</p>\n<p>sky was a-falling.</p>\n<p>So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till</p>\n<p>they met Turkey-lurkey.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,</p>\n<p>Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?” says Turkey-lurkey.</p>\n<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>we're going</p>\n<p>to tell the king the sky's a-falling,” said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,</p>\n<p>Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey.</p>\n<p>“May I come with you?</p>\n",
        "<p>Henny-penny,</p>\n<p>Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey?” said Turkey-lurkey.</p>\n<p>“Why,</p>\n<p>certainly, Turkey-lurkey,” said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,</p>\n<p>and Goosey-poosey.</p>\n<p>So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,</p>\n<p>Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey all went to tell the king the sky was</p>\n",
        "<p>a-falling.</p>\n<p>So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till</p>\n<p>they met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,</p>\n<p>Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey: “Where are you</p>\n<p>going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey,</p>\n<p>and Turkey-lurkey?” And Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,</p>\n<p>Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey said to Foxy-woxy: “We're going to tell</p>\n",
        "<p>the king the sky's a-falling.” “Oh!</p>\n<p>but this is not the way to the</p>\n<p>king, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and</p>\n<p>Turkey-lurkey,” says Foxy-woxy; “I know the proper way; shall I show</p>\n<p>it you?” “Why certainly, Foxy-woxy,” said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,</p>\n<p>Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.</p>\n<p>So Henny-penny,</p>\n",
        "<p>Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy</p>\n<p>all went to tell the king the sky was a-falling.</p>\n<p>So they went along,</p>\n<p>and they went along, and they went along, till they came to a narrow and</p>\n<p>dark hole.</p>\n<p>Now this was the door of Foxy-woxy's cave.</p>\n<p>But Foxy-woxy</p>\n",
        "<p>said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and</p>\n<p>Turkey-lurkey: “This is the short way to the king's palace you'll</p>\n<p>soon get there if you follow me.</p>\n<p>I will go first and you come</p>\n<p>after, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky daddles, Goosey-poosey, and</p>\n<p>Turkey-lurkey.” “Why of course, certainly, without doubt, why not?”</p>\n<p>said Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and</p>\n",
        "<p>Turkey-lurkey.</p>\n<p>So Foxy-woxy went into his cave, and he didn't go very far but turned</p>\n<p>round to wait for Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey</p>\n<p>and Turkey-lurkey.</p>\n<p>So at last at first Turkey-lurkey went through the</p>\n<p>dark hole into the cave.</p>\n<p>He hadn't got far when “Hrumph,” Foxy-woxy</p>\n",
        "<p>snapped off Turkey-lurkey's head and threw his body over his left</p>\n<p>shoulder.</p>\n<p>Then Goosey-poosey went in, and “Hrumph,” off went her head</p>\n<p>and Goosey-poosey was thrown beside Turkey-lurkey.</p>\n<p>Then Ducky-daddles</p>\n<p>waddled down, and “Hrumph,” snapped Foxy-woxy, and Ducky-daddles'</p>\n<p>head was off and Ducky-daddles was thrown alongside Turkey-lurkey and</p>\n",
        "<p>Goosey-poosey.</p>\n<p>Then Cocky-locky strutted down into the cave and he</p>\n<p>hadn't gone far when “Snap, Hrumph!” went Foxy-woxy and Cocky-locky was</p>\n<p>thrown alongside of Turkey-lurkey, Goosey-poosey and Ducky-daddles.</p>\n<p>But Foxy-woxy had made two bites at Cocky-locky, and when the first</p>\n<p>snap only hurt Cocky-locky, but didn't kill him, he called out to</p>\n<p>Henny-penny.</p>\n",
        "<p>So she turned tail and ran back home, so she never told the</p>\n<p>king the sky was a-falling.</p>\n<h3>CHILDE ROWLAND</h3>\n<p>Childe Rowland and his brothers twain Were playing at the ball, And</p>\n<p>there was their sister Burd Ellen In the midst, among them all.</p>\n<p>Childe Rowland kicked it with his foot</p>\n<p>And caught it with his knee;</p>\n",
        "<p>At last as he plunged among them all</p>\n<p>O'er the church he made it flee.</p>\n<p>Burd Ellen round about the aisle</p>\n<p>To seek the ball is gone,</p>\n<p>But long they waited, and longer still,</p>\n<p>And she came not back again.</p>\n<p>They sought her east, they sought her west,</p>\n",
        "<p>They sought her up and down,</p>\n<p>And woe were the hearts of those brethren,</p>\n<p>For she was not to be found.</p>\n<p>So at last her eldest brother went to the Warlock Merlin and told him</p>\n<p>all the case, and asked him if he knew where Burd Ellen was.</p>\n<p>“The fair</p>\n<p>Burd Ellen,” said the Warlock Merlin, “must have been carried off by the</p>\n",
        "<p>fairies, because she went round the church 'wider shins'--the opposite</p>\n<p>way to the sun.</p>\n<p>She is now in the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland; it</p>\n<p>would take the boldest knight in Christendom to bring her back.”</p>\n<p>“If it is possible to bring her back,” said her brother, “I'll do it, or</p>\n<p>perish in the attempt.”</p>\n<p>“Possible it is,” said the Warlock Merlin, “but woe to the man or</p>\n",
        "<p>mother's son that attempts it, if he is not well taught beforehand what</p>\n<p>he is to do.”</p>\n<p>The eldest brother of Burd Ellen was not to be put off, by any fear of</p>\n<p>danger, from attempting to get her back, so he begged the Warlock Merlin</p>\n<p>to tell him what he should do, and what he should not do, in going to</p>\n<p>seek his sister.</p>\n<p>And after he had been taught, and had repeated his</p>\n",
        "<p>lesson, he set out for Elfland.</p>\n<p>But long they waited, and longer still,</p>\n<p>With doubt and muckle pain,</p>\n<p>But woe were the hearts of his brethren,</p>\n<p>For he came not back again.</p>\n<p>Then the second brother got tired and sick of waiting, and he went to</p>\n<p>the Warlock Merlin and asked him the same as his brother.</p>\n",
        "<p>So he set out</p>\n<p>to find Burd Ellen.</p>\n<p>But long they waited, and longer still,</p>\n<p>With muckle doubt and pain,</p>\n<p>And woe were his mother's and brother's heart,</p>\n<p>For he came not back again.</p>\n<p>And when they had waited and waited a good long time, Childe Rowland,</p>\n",
        "<p>the youngest of Burd Ellen's brothers, wished to go, and went to his</p>\n<p>mother, the good queen, to ask her to let him go.</p>\n<p>But she would not at</p>\n<p>first, for he was the last of her children she now had, and if he was</p>\n<p>lost, all would be lost.</p>\n<p>But he begged, and he begged, till at last the</p>\n<p>good queen let him go, and gave him his father's good brand that never</p>\n",
        "<p>struck in vain.</p>\n<p>And as she girt it round his waist, she said the spell</p>\n<p>that would give it victory.</p>\n<p>So Childe Rowland said good-bye to the good queen, his mother, and went</p>\n<p>to the cave of the Warlock Merlin.</p>\n<p>“Once more, and but once more,” he</p>\n<p>said to the Warlock, “tell how man or mother's son may rescue Burd Ellen</p>\n",
        "<p>and her brothers twain.”</p>\n<p>“Well, my son,” said the Warlock Merlin, “there are but two things,</p>\n<p>simple they may seem, but hard they are to do.</p>\n<p>One thing to do, and one</p>\n<p>thing not to do.</p>\n<p>And the thing to do is this: after you have entered the</p>\n<p>land of Fairy, whoever speaks to you, till you meet the Burd Ellen,</p>\n",
        "<p>you must out with your father's brand and off with their head.</p>\n<p>And what</p>\n<p>you've not to do is this: bite no bit, and drink no drop, however hungry</p>\n<p>or thirsty you be; drink a drop, or bite a bit, while in Elfland you be</p>\n<p>and never will you see Middle Earth again.”</p>\n<p>So Childe Rowland said the two things over and over again, till he knew</p>\n<p>them by heart, and he thanked the Warlock Merlin and went on his way.</p>\n",
        "<p>And he went along, and along, and along, and still further along, till</p>\n<p>he came to the horse-herd of the King of Elfland feeding his horses.</p>\n<p>These he knew by their fiery eyes, and knew that he was at last in</p>\n<p>the land of Fairy.</p>\n<p>“Canst thou tell me,” said Childe Rowland to the</p>\n<p>horse-herd, “where the King of Elfland's Dark Tower is?” “I cannot tell</p>\n<p>thee,” said the horse-herd, “but go on a little further and thou wilt</p>\n",
        "<p>come to the cow-herd, and he, maybe, can tell thee.”</p>\n<p>Then, without a word more, Childe Rowland drew the good brand that never</p>\n<p>struck in vain, and off went the horse-herd's head, and Childe Rowland</p>\n<p>went on further, till he came to the cow-herd, and asked him the same</p>\n<p>question.</p>\n<p>“I can't tell thee,” said he, “but go on a little farther, and</p>\n<p>thou wilt come to the hen-wife, and she is sure to know.” Then Childe</p>\n",
        "<p>Rowland out with his good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went</p>\n<p>the cow-herd's head.</p>\n<p>And he went on a little further, till he came to an</p>\n<p>old woman in a grey cloak, and he asked her if she knew where the Dark</p>\n<p>Tower of the King of Elfland was.</p>\n<p>“Go on a little further,” said</p>\n<p>the hen-wife, “till you come to a round green hill, surrounded with</p>\n",
        "<p>terrace-rings, from the bottom to the top; go round it three times,</p>\n<p>widershins, and each time say:</p>\n<p>Open, door!</p>\n<p>open, door!</p>\n<p>And let me come in.</p>\n<p>and the third time the door will open, and you may go in.” And Childe</p>\n<p>Rowland was just going on, when he remembered what he had to do; so he</p>\n",
        "<p>out with the good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went the</p>\n<p>hen-wife's head.</p>\n<p>Then he went on, and on, and on, till he came to the round green hill</p>\n<p>with the terrace-rings from top to bottom, and he went round it three</p>\n<p>times, widershins, saying each time:</p>\n<p>Open, door!</p>\n<p>open, door!</p>\n",
        "<p>And let me come in.</p>\n<p>And the third time the door did open, and he went in, and it closed with</p>\n<p>a click, and Childe Rowland was left in the dark.</p>\n<p>It was not exactly dark, but a kind of twilight or gloaming.</p>\n<p>There</p>\n<p>were neither windows nor candles, and he could not make out where the</p>\n<p>twilight came from, if not through the walls and roof.</p>\n",
        "<p>These were rough</p>\n<p>arches made of a transparent rock, incrusted with sheepsilver and rock</p>\n<p>spar, and other bright stones.</p>\n<p>But though it was rock, the air was quite</p>\n<p>warm, as it always is in Elfland.</p>\n<p>So he went through this passage till</p>\n<p>at last he came to two wide and high folding-doors which stood ajar.</p>\n",
        "<p>And</p>\n<p>when he opened them, there he saw a most wonderful and glorious sight.</p>\n<p>A large and spacious hall, so large that it seemed to be as long, and as</p>\n<p>broad, as the green hill itself.</p>\n<p>The roof was supported by fine pillars,</p>\n<p>so large and lofty, that the pillars of a cathedral were as nothing to</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were all of gold and silver, with fretted work, and between</p>\n<p>them and around them, wreaths of flowers, composed of what do you think?</p>\n<p>Why, of diamonds and emeralds, and all manner of precious stones.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>the very key-stones of the arches had for ornaments clusters of diamonds</p>\n<p>and rubies, and pearls, and other precious stones.</p>\n<p>And all these arches</p>\n",
        "<p>met in the middle of the roof, and just there, hung by a gold chain,</p>\n<p>an immense lamp made out of one big pearl hollowed out and quite</p>\n<p>transparent.</p>\n<p>And in the middle of this was a big, huge carbuncle, which</p>\n<p>kept spinning round and round, and this was what gave light by its rays</p>\n<p>to the whole hall, which seemed as if the setting sun was shining on it.</p>\n<p>The hall was furnished in a manner equally grand, and at one end of</p>\n",
        "<p>it was a glorious couch of velvet, silk and gold, and there sate Burd</p>\n<p>Ellen, combing her golden hair with a silver comb.</p>\n<p>And when she saw</p>\n<p>Childe Rowland she stood up and said:</p>\n<p>“God pity ye, poor luckless fool,</p>\n<p>What have ye here to do?</p>\n<p>“Hear ye this, my youngest brother,</p>\n",
        "<p>Why didn't ye bide at home?</p>\n<p>Had you a hundred thousand lives</p>\n<p>Ye couldn't spare any a one.</p>\n<p>“But sit ye down; but woe, O, woe,</p>\n<p>That ever ye were born,</p>\n<p>For come the King of Elfland in,</p>\n<p>Your fortune is forlorn.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then they sate down together, and Childe Rowland told her all that he</p>\n<p>had done, and she told him how their two brothers had reached the Dark</p>\n<p>Tower, but had been enchanted by the King of Elfland, and lay there</p>\n<p>entombed as if dead.</p>\n<p>And then after they had talked a little longer</p>\n<p>Childe Rowland began to feel hungry from his long travels, and told his</p>\n<p>sister Burd Ellen how hungry he was and asked for some food, forgetting</p>\n",
        "<p>all about the Warlock Merlin's warning.</p>\n<p>Burd Ellen looked at Childe Rowland sadly, and shook her head, but she</p>\n<p>was under a spell, and could not warn him.</p>\n<p>So she rose up, and went</p>\n<p>out, and soon brought back a golden basin full of bread and milk.</p>\n<p>Childe</p>\n<p>Rowland was just going to raise it to his lips, when he looked at his</p>\n",
        "<p>sister and remembered why he had come all that way.</p>\n<p>So he dashed the</p>\n<p>bowl to the ground, and said: “Not a sup will I swallow, nor a bit will</p>\n<p>I bite, till Burd Ellen is set free.”</p>\n<p>Just at that moment they heard the noise of some one approaching, and a</p>\n<p>loud voice was heard saying:</p>\n<p>“Fee, fi, fo, fum,</p>\n",
        "<p>I smell the blood of a Christian man,</p>\n<p>Be he dead, be he living, with my brand,</p>\n<p>I'll dash his brains from his brain-pan.”</p>\n<p>And then the folding-doors of the hall were burst open, and the King of</p>\n<p>Elfland rushed in.</p>\n<p>“Strike then, Bogle, if thou darest,” shouted out Childe Rowland, and</p>\n<p>rushed to meet him with his good brand that never yet did fail.</p>\n",
        "<p>They</p>\n<p>fought, and they fought, and they fought, till Childe Rowland beat the</p>\n<p>King of Elfland down on to his knees, and caused him to yield and beg</p>\n<p>for mercy.</p>\n<p>“I grant thee mercy,” said Childe Rowland, “release my sister</p>\n<p>from thy spells and raise my brothers to life, and let us all go free,</p>\n<p>and thou shalt be spared.” “I agree,” said the Elfin King, and rising</p>\n",
        "<p>up he went to a chest from which he took a phial filled with a blood-red</p>\n<p>liquor.</p>\n<p>With this he anointed the ears, eyelids, nostrils, lips, and</p>\n<p>finger-tips, of the two brothers, and they sprang at once into life, and</p>\n<p>declared that their souls had been away, but had now returned.</p>\n<p>The Elfin</p>\n<p>king then said some words to Burd Ellen, and she was disenchanted, and</p>\n",
        "<p>they all four passed out of the hall, through the long passage, and</p>\n<p>turned their back on the Dark Tower, never to return again.</p>\n<p>And they</p>\n<p>reached home, and the good queen, their mother, and Burd Ellen never</p>\n<p>went round a church widershins again.</p>\n<h3>MOLLY WHUPPIE</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time there was a man and a wife had too many children, and</p>\n",
        "<p>they could not get meat for them, so they took the three youngest and</p>\n<p>left them in a wood.</p>\n<p>They travelled and travelled and could see never</p>\n<p>a house.</p>\n<p>It began to be dark, and they were hungry.</p>\n<p>At last they saw a</p>\n<p>light and made for it; it turned out to be a house.</p>\n",
        "<p>They knocked at the</p>\n<p>door, and a woman came to it, who said: “What do you want?” They said:</p>\n<p>“Please let us in and give us something to eat.” The woman said: “I</p>\n<p>can't do that, as my man is a giant, and he would kill you if he comes</p>\n<p>home.” They begged hard.</p>\n<p>“Let us stop for a little while,” said they,</p>\n<p>“and we will go away before he comes.” So she took them in, and set them</p>\n",
        "<p>down before the fire, and gave them milk and bread; but just as they had</p>\n<p>begun to eat a great knock came to the door, and a dreadful voice said:</p>\n<p>“Fee, fie, fo, fum,</p>\n<p>I smell the blood of some earthly one.</p>\n<p>Who have you there wife?” “Eh,” said the wife, “it's three poor lassies</p>\n<p>cold and hungry, and they will go away.</p>\n<p>Ye won't touch 'em, man.” He</p>\n",
        "<p>said nothing, but ate up a big supper, and ordered them to stay all</p>\n<p>night.</p>\n<p>Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to sleep in</p>\n<p>the same bed with the three strangers.</p>\n<p>The youngest of the three strange lassies was called Molly Whuppie, and</p>\n<p>she was very clever.</p>\n<p>She noticed that before they went to bed the giant</p>\n",
        "<p>put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters', and round his own</p>\n<p>lassies' necks he put gold chains.</p>\n<p>So Molly took care and did not fall</p>\n<p>asleep, but waited till she was sure every one was sleeping sound.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>she slipped out of the bed, and took the straw ropes off her own and her</p>\n<p>sisters' necks, and took the gold chains off the giant's lassies.</p>\n",
        "<p>She</p>\n<p>then put the straw ropes on the giant's lassies and the gold on herself</p>\n<p>and her sisters, and lay down.</p>\n<p>And in the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great</p>\n<p>club, and felt for the necks with the straw.</p>\n<p>It was dark.</p>\n<p>He took his</p>\n",
        "<p>own lassies out of bed on to the floor, and battered them until they</p>\n<p>were dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed fine.</p>\n<p>Molly</p>\n<p>thought it time she and her sisters were out of that, so she wakened</p>\n<p>them and told them to be quiet, and they slipped out of the house.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stopped until morning,</p>\n",
        "<p>when they saw a grand house before them.</p>\n<p>It turned out to be a king's</p>\n<p>house: so Molly went in, and told her story to the king.</p>\n<p>He said: “Well,</p>\n<p>Molly, you are a clever girl, and you have managed well; but, if you</p>\n<p>would manage better, and go back, and steal the giant's sword that hangs</p>\n<p>on the back of his bed, I would give your eldest sister my eldest son to</p>\n",
        "<p>marry.” Molly said she would try.</p>\n<p>So she went back, and managed to slip into the giant's house, and crept</p>\n<p>in below the bed.</p>\n<p>The giant came home, and ate up a great supper, and</p>\n<p>went to bed.</p>\n<p>Molly waited until he was snoring, and she crept out, and</p>\n<p>reached over the giant and got down the sword; but just as she got it</p>\n",
        "<p>out over the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the giant, and Molly</p>\n<p>ran out at the door and the sword with her; and she ran, and he ran,</p>\n<p>till they came to the “Bridge of one hair”; and she got over, but he</p>\n<p>couldn't, and he says, “Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie!</p>\n<p>never ye come</p>\n<p>again.” And she says “Twice yet, carle,” quoth she, “I'll come to</p>\n<p>Spain.” So Molly took the sword to the king, and her sister was married</p>\n",
        "<p>to his son.</p>\n<p>Well, the king he says: “Ye've managed well, Molly; but if ye would</p>\n<p>manage better, and steal the purse that lies below the giant's pillow,</p>\n<p>I would marry your second sister to my second son.” And Molly said she</p>\n<p>would try.</p>\n<p>So she set out for the giant's house, and slipped in, and hid</p>\n<p>again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his supper, and</p>\n",
        "<p>was snoring sound asleep.</p>\n<p>She slipped out, and slipped her hand below</p>\n<p>the pillow, and got out the purse; but just as she was going out the</p>\n<p>giant wakened, and ran after her; and she ran, and he ran, till they</p>\n<p>came to the “Bridge of one hair,” and she got over, but he couldn't, and</p>\n<p>he said, “Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie!</p>\n<p>never you come again.” “Once yet,</p>\n",
        "<p>carle,” quoth she, “I'll come to Spain.” So Molly took the purse to the</p>\n<p>king, and her second sister was married to the king's second son.</p>\n<p>After that the king says to Molly: “Molly, you are a clever girl, but if</p>\n<p>you would do better yet, and steal the giant's ring that he wears on his</p>\n<p>finger, I will give you my youngest son for yourself.” Molly said she</p>\n<p>would try.</p>\n<p>So back she goes to the giant's house, and hides herself</p>\n",
        "<p>below the bed.</p>\n<p>The giant wasn't long ere he came home, and, after he had</p>\n<p>eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly was snoring</p>\n<p>loud.</p>\n<p>Molly crept out and reached over the bed, and got hold of the</p>\n<p>giant's hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got off the ring;</p>\n<p>but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped her by the</p>\n",
        "<p>hand, and he says: “Now I have catcht you, Molly Whuppie, and, if I had</p>\n<p>done as much ill to you as ye have done to me, what would ye do to me?”</p>\n<p>Molly says: “I would put you into a sack, and I'd put the cat inside</p>\n<p>with you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and a shears,</p>\n<p>and I'd hang you up upon the wall, and I'd go to the wood, and choose</p>\n<p>the thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you</p>\n<p>down, and bang you till you were dead.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well, Molly,” says the giant, “I'll just do that to you.”</p>\n<p>So he gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog</p>\n<p>beside her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon</p>\n<p>the wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick.</p>\n<p>Molly she sings out: “Oh, if ye saw what I see.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” says the giant's wife, “what do ye see, Molly?”</p>\n<p>But Molly never said a word but, “Oh, if ye saw what I see!”</p>\n",
        "<p>The giant's wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack till</p>\n<p>she would see what Molly saw.</p>\n<p>So Molly took the shears and cut a hole in</p>\n<p>the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumped down</p>\n<p>and helped, the giant's wife up into the sack, and sewed up the hole.</p>\n<p>The giant's wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but</p>\n<p>Molly never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>Home came</p>\n<p>the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the sack,</p>\n<p>and began to batter it.</p>\n<p>His wife cried, “It's me, man;” but the dog</p>\n<p>barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife's voice.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her, and he</p>\n",
        "<p>after her; and he ran and she ran, till they came to the “Bridge of one</p>\n<p>hair,” and she got over but he couldn't; and he said, “Woe worth you,</p>\n<p>Molly Whuppie!</p>\n<p>never you come again.” “Never more, carle,” quoth she,</p>\n<p>“will I come again to Spain.”</p>\n<p>So Molly took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest</p>\n<p>son, and she never saw the giant again.</p>\n",
        "<h3>THE RED ETTIN</h3>\n<p>There was once a widow that lived on a small bit of ground, which she</p>\n<p>rented from a farmer.</p>\n<p>And she had two sons; and by-and-by it was time</p>\n<p>for the wife to send them away to seek their fortune.</p>\n<p>So she told her</p>\n<p>eldest son one day to take a can and bring her water from the well, that</p>\n",
        "<p>she might bake a cake for him; and however much or however little water</p>\n<p>he might bring, the cake would be great or small accordingly, and that</p>\n<p>cake was to be all that she could give him when he went on his travels.</p>\n<p>The lad went away with the can to the well, and filled it with water,</p>\n<p>and then came away home again; but the can being broken, the most part</p>\n<p>of the water had run out before he got back.</p>\n<p>So his cake was very small;</p>\n",
        "<p>yet small as it was, his mother asked him if he was willing to take the</p>\n<p>half of it with her blessing, telling him that, if he chose rather to</p>\n<p>take the whole, he would only get it with her curse.</p>\n<p>The young man,</p>\n<p>thinking he might have to travel a far way, and not knowing when or</p>\n<p>how he might get other provisions, said he would like to have the whole</p>\n<p>cake, come of his mother's malison what like; so she gave him the whole</p>\n",
        "<p>cake, and her malison along with it.</p>\n<p>Then he took his brother aside, and</p>\n<p>gave him a knife to keep till he should come back, desiring him to look</p>\n<p>at it every morning, and as long as it continued to be clear, then he</p>\n<p>might be sure that the owner of it was well; but if it grew dim and</p>\n<p>rusty, then for certain some ill had befallen him.</p>\n<p>So the young man went to seek his fortune.</p>\n",
        "<p>And he went all that day, and</p>\n<p>all the next day; and on the third day, in the afternoon, he came up to</p>\n<p>where a shepherd was sitting with a flock of sheep.</p>\n<p>And he went up to</p>\n<p>the shepherd and asked him who the sheep belonged to; and he answered:</p>\n<p>“The Red Ettin of Ireland</p>\n<p>Once lived in Ballygan,</p>\n",
        "<p>And stole King Malcolm's daughter</p>\n<p>The king of fair Scotland.</p>\n<p>He beats her, he binds her,</p>\n<p>He lays her on a band;</p>\n<p>And every day he strikes her</p>\n<p>With a bright silver wand.</p>\n<p>Like Julian the Roman,</p>\n",
        "<p>He's one that fears no man.</p>\n<p>It's said there's one predestinate</p>\n<p>To be his mortal foe;</p>\n<p>But that man is yet unborn,</p>\n<p>And long may it be so.”</p>\n<p>This shepherd also told him to beware of the beasts he should next meet,</p>\n<p>for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seen.</p>\n",
        "<p>So the young man went on, and by-and-by he saw a multitude of very</p>\n<p>dreadful beasts, with two heads, and on every head four horns.</p>\n<p>And he</p>\n<p>was sore frightened, and ran away from them as fast as he could; and</p>\n<p>glad was he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock, with the</p>\n<p>door standing wide open to the wall.</p>\n<p>And he went into the castle for</p>\n",
        "<p>shelter, and there he saw an old wife sitting beside the kitchen fire.</p>\n<p>He asked the wife if he might stay for the night, as he was tired with</p>\n<p>a long journey; and the wife said he might, but it was not a good</p>\n<p>place for him to be in, as it belonged to the Red Ettin, who was a very</p>\n<p>terrible beast, with three heads, that spared no living man it could get</p>\n<p>hold of.</p>\n<p>The young man would have gone away, but he was afraid of the</p>\n",
        "<p>beasts on the outside of the castle; so he beseeched the old woman to</p>\n<p>hide him as best she could, and not tell the Ettin he was there.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>thought, if he could put over the night, he might get away in the</p>\n<p>morning, without meeting with the beasts, and so escape.</p>\n<p>But he had not</p>\n<p>been long in his hiding-hole, before the awful Ettin came in; and no</p>\n",
        "<p>sooner was he in, than he was heard crying:</p>\n<p>“Snouk but and snouk ben,</p>\n<p>I find the smell of an earthly man,</p>\n<p>Be he living, or be he dead,</p>\n<p>His heart this night shall kitchen my bread.”</p>\n<p>The monster soon found the poor young man, and pulled him from his hole.</p>\n<p>And when he had got him out, he told him that if he could answer him</p>\n",
        "<p>three questions his life should be spared.</p>\n<p>So the first head asked: “A</p>\n<p>thing without an end, what's that?” But the young man knew not.</p>\n<p>Then the</p>\n<p>second head said: “The smaller, the more dangerous, what's that?” But</p>\n<p>the young man knew it not.</p>\n<p>And then the third head asked: “The dead</p>\n",
        "<p>carrying the living; riddle me that?” But the young man had to give it</p>\n<p>up.</p>\n<p>The lad not being able to answer one of these questions, the Red</p>\n<p>Ettin took a mallet and knocked him on the head, and turned him into a</p>\n<p>pillar of stone.</p>\n<p>On the morning after this happened, the younger brother took out the</p>\n<p>knife to look at it, and he was grieved to find it all brown with rust.</p>\n",
        "<p>He told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon</p>\n<p>his travels also; so she requested him to take the can to the well for</p>\n<p>water, that she might make a cake for him.</p>\n<p>And he went, and as he was</p>\n<p>bringing home the water, a raven over his head cried to him to look, and</p>\n<p>he would see that the water was running out.</p>\n<p>And he was a young man of</p>\n",
        "<p>sense, and seeing the water running out, he took some clay and patched</p>\n<p>up the holes, so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake.</p>\n<p>When his mother put it to him to take the half cake with her blessing,</p>\n<p>he took it in preference to having the whole with her malison; and yet</p>\n<p>the half was bigger than what the other lad had got.</p>\n<p>So he went away on his journey; and after he had travelled a far way, he</p>\n<p>met with an old woman that asked him if he would give her a bit of his</p>\n",
        "<p>johnny-cake.</p>\n<p>And he said: “I will gladly do that,” and so he gave her a</p>\n<p>piece of the johnny-cake; and for that she gave him a magical wand, that</p>\n<p>she might yet be of service to him, if he took care to use it rightly.</p>\n<p>Then the old woman, who was a fairy, told him a great deal that would</p>\n<p>happen to him, and what he ought to do in all circumstances; and after</p>\n<p>that she vanished in an instant out of his sight.</p>\n",
        "<p>He went on a great way</p>\n<p>farther, and then he came up to the old man herding the sheep; and when</p>\n<p>he asked whose sheep these were, the answer was:</p>\n<p>“The Red Ettin of Ireland</p>\n<p>Once lived in Ballygan,</p>\n<p>And stole King Malcolm's daughter,</p>\n<p>The king of Fair Scotland.</p>\n",
        "<p>“He beats her, he binds her,</p>\n<p>He lays her on a band;</p>\n<p>And every day he strikes her</p>\n<p>With a bright silver wand.</p>\n<p>Like Julian the Roman,</p>\n<p>He's one that fears no man.</p>\n<p>“But now I fear his end is near,</p>\n",
        "<p>And destiny at hand;</p>\n<p>And you're to be, I plainly see,</p>\n<p>The heir of all his land.”</p>\n<p>When he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing, he</p>\n<p>did not stop nor run away, but went boldly through amongst them.</p>\n<p>One</p>\n<p>came up roaring with open mouth to devour him, when he struck it with</p>\n",

        "<p>came in, saying:</p>\n<p>“Snouk but and snouk ben,</p>\n<p>I find the smell of an earthly man;</p>\n<p>Be he living, or be he dead,</p>\n<p>His heart shall be kitchen to my bread.”</p>\n<p>He quickly espied the young man, and bade him come forth on the floor.</p>\n<p>And then he put the three questions to him; but the young man had been</p>\n",
        "<p>told everything by the good fairy, so he was able to answer all the</p>\n<p>questions.</p>\n<p>So when the first head asked, “What's the thing without an</p>\n<p>end?” he said: “A bowl.” And when the second head said: “The smaller the</p>\n<p>more dangerous; what's that?” he said at once, “A bridge.” And last, the</p>\n<p>third head said: “When does the dead carry the living, riddle me that?”</p>\n<p>Then the young man answered up at once and said: “When a ship sails on</p>\n",
        "<p>the sea with men inside her.” When the Ettin found this, he knew that</p>\n<p>his power was gone.</p>\n<p>The young man then took up an axe and hewed off the</p>\n<p>monster's three heads.</p>\n<p>He next asked the old woman to show him where the</p>\n<p>king's daughter lay; and the old woman took him upstairs, and opened a</p>\n<p>great many doors, and out of every door came a beautiful lady who had</p>\n",
        "<p>been imprisoned there by the Ettin; and one of the ladies was the king's</p>\n<p>daughter.</p>\n<p>She also took him down into a low room, and there stood a</p>\n<p>stone pillar, that he had only to touch with his wand, when his brother</p>\n<p>started into life.</p>\n<p>And the whole of the prisoners were overjoyed at</p>\n<p>their deliverance, for which they thanked the young man.</p>\n",
        "<p>Next day they</p>\n<p>all set out for the king's court, and a gallant company they made.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>the king married his daughter to the young man that had delivered</p>\n<p>her, and gave a noble's daughter to his brother; and so they all lived</p>\n<p>happily all the rest of their days.</p>\n<h3>THE GOLDEN ARM</h3>\n",
        "<p>Here was once a man who travelled the land all over in search of a wife.</p>\n<p>He saw young and old, rich and poor, pretty and plain, and could not</p>\n<p>meet with one to his mind.</p>\n<p>At last he found a woman, young, fair, and</p>\n<p>rich, who possessed a right arm of solid gold.</p>\n<p>He married her at once,</p>\n<p>and thought no man so fortunate as he was.</p>\n",
        "<p>They lived happily together,</p>\n<p>but, though he wished people to think otherwise, he was fonder of the</p>\n<p>golden arm than of all his wife's gifts besides.</p>\n<p>At last she died.</p>\n<p>The husband put on the blackest black, and pulled the</p>\n<p>longest face at the funeral; but for all that he got up in the middle of</p>\n<p>the night, dug up the body, and cut off the golden arm.</p>\n",
        "<p>He hurried home</p>\n<p>to hide his treasure, and thought no one would know.</p>\n<p>The following night he put the golden arm under his pillow, and was just</p>\n<p>falling asleep, when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room.</p>\n<p>Stalking up to the bedside it drew the curtain, and looked at him</p>\n<p>reproachfully.</p>\n<p>Pretending not to be afraid, he spoke to the ghost, and</p>\n",
        "<p>said: “What hast thou done with thy cheeks so red?”</p>\n<p>“All withered and wasted away,” replied the ghost, in a hollow tone.</p>\n<p>“What hast thou done with thy red rosy lips?”</p>\n<p>“All withered and wasted away.”</p>\n<p>“What hast thou done with thy golden hair?”</p>\n<p>“All withered and wasted away.”</p>\n<p>“What hast thou done with thy _Golden Arm_?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>“THOU HAST IT!”</h3>\n<h3>THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB</h3>\n<p>In the days of the great Prince Arthur, there lived a mighty magician,</p>\n<p>called Merlin, the most learned and skilful enchanter the world has ever</p>\n<p>seen.</p>\n<p>This famous magician, who could take any form he pleased, was travelling</p>\n<p>about as a poor beggar, and being very tired, he stopped at the cottage</p>\n",
        "<p>of a ploughman to rest himself, and asked for some food.</p>\n<p>The countryman bade him welcome, and his wife, who was a very</p>\n<p>good-hearted woman, soon brought him some milk in a wooden bowl, and</p>\n<p>some coarse brown bread on a platter.</p>\n<p>Merlin was much pleased with the kindness of the ploughman and his</p>\n<p>wife; but he could not help noticing that though everything was neat</p>\n<p>and comfortable in the cottage, they seemed both to be very unhappy.</p>\n",
        "<p>He</p>\n<p>therefore asked them why they were so melancholy, and learned that they</p>\n<p>were miserable because they had no children.</p>\n<p>The poor woman said, with tears in her eyes: “I should be the happiest</p>\n<p>creature in the world if I had a son; although he was no bigger than my</p>\n<p>husband's thumb, I would be satisfied.”</p>\n<p>Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man's</p>\n",
        "<p>thumb, that he determined to grant the poor woman's wish.</p>\n<p>Accordingly,</p>\n<p>in a short time after, the ploughman's wife had a son, who, wonderful to</p>\n<p>relate!</p>\n<p>was not a bit bigger than his father's thumb.</p>\n<p>The queen of the fairies, wishing to see the little fellow, came in at</p>\n<p>the window while the mother was sitting up in the bed admiring him.</p>\n",
        "<p>The</p>\n<p>queen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, sent for</p>\n<p>some of the fairies, who dressed her little godson according to her</p>\n<p>orders:</p>\n<p>“An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;</p>\n<p>His shirt of web by spiders spun;</p>\n<p>With jacket wove of thistle's down;</p>\n",
        "<p>His trowsers were of feathers done.</p>\n<p>His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie</p>\n<p>With eyelash from his mother's eye</p>\n<p>His shoes were made of mouse's skin,</p>\n<p>Tann'd with the downy hair within.”</p>\n<p>Tom never grew any larger than his father's thumb, which was only of</p>\n<p>ordinary size; but as he got older he became very cunning and full of</p>\n",
        "<p>tricks.</p>\n<p>When he was old enough to play with the boys, and had lost</p>\n<p>all his own cherry-stones, he used to creep into the bags of his</p>\n<p>playfellows, fill his pockets, and, getting out without their noticing</p>\n<p>him, would again join in the game.</p>\n<p>One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherry-stones, where</p>\n<p>he had been stealing as usual, the boy to whom it belonged chanced to</p>\n",
        "<p>see him.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah!</p>\n<p>my little Tommy,” said the boy, “so I have caught you</p>\n<p>stealing my cherry-stones at last, and you shall be rewarded for your</p>\n<p>thievish tricks.” On saying this, he drew the string tight round his</p>\n<p>neck, and gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor little Tom's legs,</p>\n<p>thighs, and body were sadly bruised.</p>\n",
        "<p>He roared out with pain, and begged</p>\n<p>to be let out, promising never to steal again.</p>\n<p>A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter-pudding, and Tom,</p>\n<p>being very anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge of the</p>\n<p>bowl; but his foot slipped, and he plumped over head and ears into</p>\n<p>the batter, without his mother noticing him, who stirred him into the</p>\n<p>pudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.</p>\n",
        "<p>The batter filled Tom's mouth, and prevented him from crying; but, on</p>\n<p>feeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot, that</p>\n<p>his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, pulling it</p>\n<p>out of the pot, she threw it outside the door.</p>\n<p>A poor tinker, who was</p>\n<p>passing by, lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his budget, he</p>\n<p>then walked off.</p>\n",
        "<p>As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter, he</p>\n<p>then began to cry aloud, which so frightened the tinker that he flung</p>\n<p>down the pudding and ran away.</p>\n<p>The pudding being broke to pieces by the</p>\n<p>fall, Tom crept out covered all over with the batter, and walked home.</p>\n<p>His mother, who was very sorry to see her darling in such a woeful</p>\n<p>state, put him into a teacup, and soon washed off the batter; after</p>\n",
        "<p>which she kissed him, and laid him in bed.</p>\n<p>Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom's mother went to milk her</p>\n<p>cow in the meadow, and she took him along with her.</p>\n<p>As the wind was very</p>\n<p>high, for fear of being blown away, she tied him to a thistle with a</p>\n<p>piece of fine thread.</p>\n<p>The cow soon observed Tom's oak-leaf hat, and</p>\n",
        "<p>liking the appearance of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one</p>\n<p>mouthful.</p>\n<p>While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her</p>\n<p>great teeth, which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared out</p>\n<p>as loud as he could: “Mother, mother!”</p>\n<p>“Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?” said his mother.</p>\n<p>“Here, mother,” replied he, “in the red cow's mouth.”</p>\n",
        "<p>His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised</p>\n<p>at the odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out.</p>\n<p>Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the</p>\n<p>ground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt.</p>\n<p>She then put Tom in her</p>\n<p>bosom and ran home with him.</p>\n<p>Tom's father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive the cattle with,</p>\n",
        "<p>and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped a foot and rolled</p>\n<p>into the furrow.</p>\n<p>A raven, which was flying over, picked him up, and flew</p>\n<p>with him over the sea, and there dropped him.</p>\n<p>A large fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which was</p>\n<p>soon after caught, and bought for the table of King Arthur.</p>\n<p>When they</p>\n",
        "<p>opened the fish in order to cook it, every one was astonished at finding</p>\n<p>such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted at being free again.</p>\n<p>They carried him to the king, who made Tom his dwarf, and he soon grew</p>\n<p>a great favourite at court; for by his tricks and gambols he not only</p>\n<p>amused the king and queen, but also all the Knights of the Round Table.</p>\n<p>It is said that when the king rode out on horseback, he often took</p>\n<p>Tom along with him, and if a shower came on, he used to creep into his</p>\n",
        "<p>majesty's waistcoat-pocket, where he slept till the rain was over.</p>\n<p>King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know if they</p>\n<p>were as small as he was, and whether they were well off.</p>\n<p>Tom told the</p>\n<p>king that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about the court,</p>\n<p>but in rather poor circumstances.</p>\n<p>On hearing this, the king carried Tom</p>\n",
        "<p>to his treasury, the place where he kept all his money, and told him to</p>\n<p>take as much money as he could carry home to his parents, which made</p>\n<p>the poor little fellow caper with joy.</p>\n<p>Tom went immediately to procure</p>\n<p>a purse, which was made of a water-bubble, and then returned to the</p>\n<p>treasury, where he received a silver threepenny-piece to put into it.</p>\n<p>Our little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon his</p>\n",
        "<p>back; but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind, and set</p>\n<p>forward on his journey.</p>\n<p>However, without meeting with any accident, and</p>\n<p>after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way, in two days</p>\n<p>and two nights he reached his father's house in safety.</p>\n<p>Tom had travelled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece on his</p>\n<p>back, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meet</p>\n",
        "<p>him, and carried him into the house.</p>\n<p>But he soon returned to Court.</p>\n<p>As Tom's clothes had suffered much in the batter-pudding, and the inside</p>\n<p>of the fish, his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and to be</p>\n<p>mounted as a knight on a mouse.</p>\n<p>Of Butterfly's wings his shirt was made,</p>\n<p>His boots of chicken's hide;</p>\n",
        "<p>And by a nimble fairy blade,</p>\n<p>Well learned in the tailoring trade,</p>\n<p>His clothing was supplied.</p>\n<p>A needle dangled by his side;</p>\n<p>A dapper mouse he used to ride,</p>\n<p>Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!</p>\n<p>It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress and mounted on</p>\n",
        "<p>the mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the king and nobility, who were</p>\n<p>all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine prancing charger.</p>\n<p>The king was so charmed with his address that he ordered a little chair</p>\n<p>to be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also a</p>\n<p>palace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>also gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.</p>\n",
        "<p>The queen was so enraged at the honours conferred on Sir Thomas that she</p>\n<p>resolved to ruin him, and told the king that the little knight had been</p>\n<p>saucy to her.</p>\n<p>The king sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of the</p>\n<p>danger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell, where he lay</p>\n<p>for a long time until he was almost starved with hunger; but at last he</p>\n<p>ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground,</p>\n",
        "<p>near the place of his concealment, he got close to it and jumping</p>\n<p>astride on it, was carried up into the air.</p>\n<p>The butterfly flew with him</p>\n<p>from tree to tree and from field to field, and at last returned to the</p>\n<p>court, where the king and nobility all strove to catch him; but at last</p>\n<p>poor Tom fell from his seat into a watering-pot, in which he was almost</p>\n<p>drowned.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should be</p>\n<p>beheaded; and he was again put into a mouse trap until the time of his</p>\n<p>execution.</p>\n<p>However a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it about</p>\n<p>till the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.</p>\n<p>The king received Tom again into favour, which he did not live to enjoy,</p>\n<p>for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew his sword</p>\n",
        "<p>and fought well, yet the spider's poisonous breath at last overcame him.</p>\n<p>He fell dead on the ground where he stood,</p>\n<p>And the spider suck'd every drop of his blood.</p>\n<p>King Arthur and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their</p>\n<p>little favourite that they went into mourning and raised a fine white</p>\n<p>marble monument over his grave with the following epitaph:</p>\n<p>Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,</p>\n",
        "<p>Who died by a spider's cruel bite.</p>\n<p>He was well known in Arthur's court,</p>\n<p>Where he afforded gallant sport;</p>\n<p>He rode at tilt and tournament,</p>\n<p>And on a mouse a-hunting went.</p>\n<p>Alive he filled the court with mirth;</p>\n<p>His death to sorrow soon gave birth.</p>\n",

        "<p>Fox was away for a day or two on business, as he said, Lady Mary set out</p>\n<p>for Mr.</p>\n<p>Fox's castle.</p>\n<p>And after many searchings, she came at last to</p>\n<p>it, and a fine strong house it was, with high walls and a deep moat.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when she came up to the gateway she saw written on it:</p>\n",

        "<p>in the winter-time.</p>\n<p>So they called him Lazy Jack.</p>\n<p>His mother could not</p>\n<p>get him to do anything for her, and at last told him, one Monday, that</p>\n<p>if he did not begin to work for his porridge she would turn him out to</p>\n<p>get his living as he could.</p>\n<p>This roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for the next day</p>\n",
        "<p>to a neighbouring farmer for a penny; but as he was coming home, never</p>\n<p>having had any money before, he lost it in passing over a brook.</p>\n<p>“You</p>\n<p>stupid boy,” said his mother, “you should have put it in your pocket.”</p>\n<p>“I'll do so another time,” replied Jack.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Jack went out again and hired himself to a cow-keeper, who</p>\n<p>gave him a jar of milk for his day's work.</p>\n",
        "<p>Jack took the jar and put it</p>\n<p>into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all, long before he got</p>\n<p>home.</p>\n<p>“Dear me!” said the old woman; “you should have carried it on your</p>\n<p>head.” “I'll do so another time,” said Jack.</p>\n<p>So on Thursday, Jack hired himself again to a farmer, who agreed to</p>\n<p>give him a cream cheese for his services.</p>\n",
        "<p>In the evening Jack took the</p>\n<p>cheese, and went home with it on his head.</p>\n<p>By the time he got home the</p>\n<p>cheese was all spoilt, part of it being lost, and part matted with his</p>\n<p>hair.</p>\n<p>“You stupid lout,” said his mother, “you should have carried it</p>\n<p>very carefully in your hands.” “I'll do so another time,” replied Jack.</p>\n",
        "<p>On Friday, Lazy Jack again went out, and hired himself to a baker, who</p>\n<p>would give him nothing for his work but a large tom-cat.</p>\n<p>Jack took the</p>\n<p>cat, and began carrying it very carefully in his hands, but in a short</p>\n<p>time pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it go.</p>\n<p>When he got home, his mother said to him, “You silly fellow, you should</p>\n<p>have tied it with a string, and dragged it along after you.” “I'll do so</p>\n",
        "<p>another time,” said Jack.</p>\n<p>So on Saturday, Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded him by the</p>\n<p>handsome present of a shoulder of mutton.</p>\n<p>Jack took the mutton, tied it</p>\n<p>to a string, and trailed it along after him in the dirt, so that by the</p>\n<p>time he had got home the meat was completely spoilt.</p>\n<p>His mother was this</p>\n",
        "<p>time quite out of patience with him, for the next day was Sunday,</p>\n<p>and she was obliged to make do with cabbage for her dinner.</p>\n<p>“You</p>\n<p>ninney-hammer,” said she to her son; “you should have carried it on your</p>\n<p>shoulder.” “I'll do so another time,” replied Jack.</p>\n<p>On the next Monday, Lazy Jack went once more, and hired himself to a</p>\n<p>cattle-keeper, who gave him a donkey for his trouble.</p>\n",
        "<p>Jack found it hard</p>\n<p>to hoist the donkey on his shoulders, but at last he did it, and began</p>\n<p>walking slowly home with his prize.</p>\n<p>Now it happened that in the</p>\n<p>course of his journey there lived a rich man with his only daughter,</p>\n<p>a beautiful girl, but deaf and dumb.</p>\n<p>Now she had never laughed in her</p>\n",
        "<p>life, and the doctors said she would never speak till somebody made her</p>\n<p>laugh.</p>\n<p>This young lady happened to be looking out of the window when</p>\n<p>Jack was passing with the donkey on his shoulders, with the legs</p>\n<p>sticking up in the air, and the sight was so comical and strange that</p>\n<p>she burst out into a great fit of laughter, and immediately recovered</p>\n<p>her speech and hearing.</p>\n",
        "<p>Her father was overjoyed, and fulfilled</p>\n<p>his promise by marrying her to Lazy Jack, who was thus made a rich</p>\n<p>gentleman.</p>\n<p>They lived in a large house, and Jack's mother lived with</p>\n<p>them in great happiness until she died.</p>\n<h3>JOHNNY-CAKE</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time there was an old man, and an old woman, and a little</p>\n",
        "<p>boy.</p>\n<p>One morning the old woman made a Johnny-cake, and put it in the</p>\n<p>oven to bake.</p>\n<p>“You watch the Johnny-cake while your father and I go out</p>\n<p>to work in the garden.” So the old man and the old woman went out and</p>\n<p>began to hoe potatoes, and left the little boy to tend the oven.</p>\n<p>But he</p>\n",
        "<p>didn't watch it all the time, and all of a sudden he heard a noise, and</p>\n<p>he looked up and the oven door popped open, and out of the oven jumped</p>\n<p>Johnny-cake, and went rolling along end over end, towards the open door</p>\n<p>of the house.</p>\n<p>The little boy ran to shut the door, but Johnny-cake was</p>\n<p>too quick for him and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out</p>\n<p>into the road long before the little boy could catch him.</p>\n",
        "<p>The little boy</p>\n<p>ran after him as fast as he could clip it, crying out to his father and</p>\n<p>mother, who heard the uproar, and threw down their hoes and gave chase</p>\n<p>too.</p>\n<p>But Johnny-cake outran all three a long way, and was soon out of</p>\n<p>sight, while they had to sit down, all out of breath, on a bank to rest.</p>\n<p>On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to two well-diggers who</p>\n",
        "<p>looked up from their work and called out: “Where ye going, Johnny-cake?”</p>\n<p>He said: “I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy,</p>\n<p>and I can outrun you too-o-o!”</p>\n<p>“Ye can, can ye?</p>\n<p>we'll see about that?” said they; and they threw down</p>\n<p>their picks and ran after him, but couldn't catch up with him, and soon</p>\n<p>they had to sit down by the roadside to rest.</p>\n",
        "<p>On ran Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to two ditch-diggers who were</p>\n<p>digging a ditch.</p>\n<p>“Where ye going, Johnny-cake?” said they.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<p>“I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy, and two</p>\n<p>well-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!”</p>\n<p>“Ye can, can ye?</p>\n",
        "<p>we'll see about that!” said they; and they threw down</p>\n<p>their spades, and ran after him too.</p>\n<p>But Johnny-cake soon outstripped</p>\n<p>them also, and seeing they could never catch him, they gave up the chase</p>\n<p>and sat down to rest.</p>\n<p>On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a bear.</p>\n<p>The bear said:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Where are ye going, Johnny-cake?”</p>\n<p>He said: “I've outrun an old man, and an old woman and a little boy, and</p>\n<p>two well-diggers, and two ditch-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!”</p>\n<p>“Ye can, can ye?” growled the bear, “we'll see about that!” and trotted</p>\n<p>as fast as his legs could carry him after Johnny-cake, who never stopped</p>\n<p>to look behind him.</p>\n<p>Before long the bear was left so far behind that</p>\n",
        "<p>he saw he might as well give up the hunt first as last, so he stretched</p>\n<p>himself out by the roadside to rest.</p>\n<p>On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a wolf.</p>\n<p>The wolf</p>\n<p>said:--“Where ye going, Johnny-cake?” He said: “I've outrun an old</p>\n<p>man, and an old woman, and a little boy, and two well-diggers, and two</p>\n<p>ditch-diggers and a bear, and I can outrun you too-o-o!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ye can, can ye?” snarled the wolf, “we'll see about that!” And he set</p>\n<p>into a gallop after Johnny-cake, who went on and on so fast that the</p>\n<p>wolf too saw there was no hope of overtaking him, and he too lay down to</p>\n<p>rest.</p>\n<p>On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a fox that lay quietly in</p>\n<p>a corner of the fence.</p>\n<p>The fox called out in a sharp voice, but without</p>\n",
        "<p>getting up: “Where ye going Johnny-cake?”</p>\n<p>He said: “I've outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy,</p>\n<p>and two well-diggers, and two ditch-diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I</p>\n<p>can outrun you too-o-o!”</p>\n<p>The fox said: “I can't quite hear you, Johnny-cake, won't you come a</p>\n<p>little closer?” turning his head a little to one side.</p>\n<p>Johnny-cake stopped his race for the first time, and went a little</p>\n",
        "<p>closer, and called out in a very loud voice _“I've outrun an old man,</p>\n<p>and an old woman, and a little boy, and two well-diggers, and two</p>\n<p>ditch-diggers, and a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-o.”_</p>\n<p>“Can't quite hear you; won't you come a _little_ closer?” said the fox</p>\n<p>in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck towards Johnny-cake, and</p>\n<p>put one paw behind his ear.</p>\n<p>Johnny-cake came up close, and leaning towards the fox screamed out:</p>\n",
        "<h3>I'VE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AND AN OLD WOMAN, AND A LITTLE BOY, AND TWO</h3>\n<p>WELL-DIGGERS, AND TWO DITCH-DIGGERS, AND A BEAR, AND A WOLF, AND I CAN</p>\n<h3>OUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!”</h3>\n<p>“You can, can you?” yelped the fox, and he snapped up the Johnny-cake in</p>\n<p>his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye.</p>\n<h3>EARL MAR'S DAUGHTER</h3>\n<p>One fine summer's day Earl Mar's daughter went into the castle garden,</p>\n",
        "<p>dancing and tripping along.</p>\n<p>And as she played and sported she would stop</p>\n<p>from time to time to listen to the music of the birds.</p>\n<p>After a while as</p>\n<p>she sat under the shade of a green oak tree she looked up and spied a</p>\n<p>sprightly dove sitting high up on one of its branches.</p>\n<p>She looked up</p>\n",
        "<p>and said: “Coo-my-dove, my dear, come down to me and I will give you a</p>\n<p>golden cage.</p>\n<p>I'll take you home and pet you well, as well as any bird</p>\n<p>of them all.” Scarcely had she said these words when the dove flew down</p>\n<p>from the branch and settled on her shoulder, nestling up against her</p>\n<p>neck while she smoothed its feathers.</p>\n<p>Then she took it home to her own</p>\n",
        "<p>room.</p>\n<p>The day was done and the night came on and Earl Mar's daughter was</p>\n<p>thinking of going to sleep when, turning round, she found at her side a</p>\n<p>handsome young man.</p>\n<p>She _was_ startled, for the door had been locked</p>\n<p>for hours.</p>\n<p>But she was a brave girl and said: “What are you doing here,</p>\n",
        "<p>young man, to come and startle me so?</p>\n<p>The door was barred these hours</p>\n<p>ago; how ever did you come here?”</p>\n<p>“Hush!</p>\n<p>hush!” the young man whispered.</p>\n<p>“I was that cooing dove that you</p>\n<p>coaxed from off the tree.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“But who are you then?” she said quite low; “and how came you to be</p>\n<p>changed into that dear little bird?”</p>\n<p>“My name is Florentine, and my mother is a queen, and something more</p>\n<p>than a queen, for she knows magic and spells, and because I would not do</p>\n<p>as she wished she turned me into a dove by day, but at night her spells</p>\n<p>lose their power and I become a man again.</p>\n<p>To-day I crossed the sea and</p>\n",
        "<p>saw you for the first time and I was glad to be a bird that I could come</p>\n<p>near you.</p>\n<p>Unless you love me, I shall never be happy more.”</p>\n<p>“But if I love you,” says she, “will you not fly away and leave me one</p>\n<p>of these fine days?”</p>\n<p>“Never, never,” said the prince; “be my wife and I'll be yours for ever.</p>\n<p>By day a bird, by night a prince, I will always be by your side as a</p>\n",
        "<p>husband, dear.”</p>\n<p>So they were married in secret and lived happily in the castle and no</p>\n<p>one knew that every night Coo-my-dove became Prince Florentine.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>every year a little son came to them as bonny as bonny could be.</p>\n<p>But as</p>\n<p>each son was born Prince Florentine carried the little thing away on</p>\n",
        "<p>his back over the sea to where the queen his mother lived and left the</p>\n<p>little one with her.</p>\n<p>Seven years passed thus and then a great trouble came to them.</p>\n<p>For the</p>\n<p>Earl Mar wished to marry his daughter to a noble of high degree who came</p>\n<p>wooing her.</p>\n<p>Her father pressed her sore but she said: “Father dear, I do</p>\n",
        "<p>not wish to marry; I can be quite happy with Coo-my-dove here.”</p>\n<p>Then her father got into a mighty rage and swore a great big oath, and</p>\n<p>said: “To-morrow, so sure as I live and eat, I'll twist that birdie's</p>\n<p>neck,” and out he stamped from her room.</p>\n<p>“Oh, oh!” said Coo-my-dove; “it's time that I was away,” and so he</p>\n<p>jumped upon the window-sill and in a moment was flying away.</p>\n<p>And he flew</p>\n",
        "<p>and he flew till he was over the deep, deep sea, and yet on he flew till</p>\n<p>he came to his mother's castle.</p>\n<p>Now the queen his mother was taking her</p>\n<p>walk abroad when she saw the pretty dove flying overhead and alighting</p>\n<p>on the castle walls.</p>\n<p>“Here, dancers come and dance your jigs,” she called, “and pipers, pipe</p>\n<p>you well, for here's my own Florentine, come back to me to stay for he's</p>\n",
        "<p>brought no bonny boy with him this time.”</p>\n<p>“No, mother,” said Florentine, “no dancers for me and no minstrels, for</p>\n<p>my dear wife, the mother of my seven, boys, is to be wed to-morrow, and</p>\n<p>sad's the day for me.”</p>\n<p>“What can I do, my son?” said the queen, “tell me, and it shall be done</p>\n<p>if my magic has power to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Well then, mother dear, turn the twenty-four dancers and pipers into</p>\n",
        "<p>twenty-four grey herons, and let my seven sons become seven white swans,</p>\n<p>and let me be a goshawk and their leader.”</p>\n<p>“Alas!</p>\n<p>alas!</p>\n<p>my son,” she said, “that may not be; my magic reaches</p>\n<p>not so far.</p>\n<p>But perhaps my teacher, the spaewife of Ostree, may know</p>\n",
        "<p>better.” And away she hurries to the cave of Ostree, and after a while</p>\n<p>comes out as white as white can be and muttering over some burning herbs</p>\n<p>she brought out of the cave.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Coo-my-dove changed into a goshawk</p>\n<p>and around him flew twenty-four grey herons and above them flew seven</p>\n<p>cygnets.</p>\n<p>Without a word or a good-bye off they flew over the deep blue sea which</p>\n",
        "<p>was tossing and moaning.</p>\n<p>They flew and they flew till they swooped down</p>\n<p>on Earl Mar's castle just as the wedding party were setting out for the</p>\n<p>church.</p>\n<p>First came the men-at-arms and then the bridegroom's friends,</p>\n<p>and then Earl Mar's men, and then the bridegroom, and lastly, pale</p>\n<p>and beautiful, Earl Mar's daughter herself.</p>\n",
        "<p>They moved down slowly to</p>\n<p>stately music till they came past the trees on which the birds were</p>\n<p>settling.</p>\n<p>A word from Prince Florentine, the goshawk, and they all rose</p>\n<p>into the air, herons beneath, cygnets above, and goshawk circling above</p>\n<p>all.</p>\n<p>The weddineers wondered at the sight when, swoop!</p>\n",
        "<p>the herons were</p>\n<p>down among them scattering the men-at-arms.</p>\n<p>The swanlets took charge</p>\n<p>of the bride while the goshawk dashed down and tied the bridegroom to a</p>\n<p>tree.</p>\n<p>Then the herons gathered themselves together into one feather bed</p>\n<p>and the cygnets placed their mother upon them, and suddenly they all</p>\n",
        "<p>rose in the air bearing the bride away with them in safety towards</p>\n<p>Prince Florentine's home.</p>\n<p>Surely a wedding party was never so disturbed</p>\n<p>in this world.</p>\n<p>What could the weddineers do?</p>\n<p>They saw their pretty bride</p>\n<p>carried away and away till she and the herons and the swans and the</p>\n",
        "<p>goshawk disappeared, and that very day Prince Florentine brought Earl</p>\n<p>Mar's daughter to the castle of the queen his mother, who took the spell</p>\n<p>off him and they lived happy ever afterwards.</p>\n<p>MR.</p>\n<h3>MIACCA</h3>\n<p>Tommy Grimes was sometimes a good boy, and sometimes a bad boy; and when</p>\n<p>he was a bad boy, he was a very bad boy.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now his mother used to say to</p>\n<p>him: “Tommy, Tommy, be a good boy, and don't go out of the street, or</p>\n<p>else Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca will take you.” But still when he was a bad boy he would</p>\n<p>go out of the street; and one day, sure enough, he had scarcely got</p>\n<p>round the corner, when Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca did catch him and popped him into a</p>\n",
        "<p>bag upside down, and took him off to his house.</p>\n<p>When Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca got Tommy inside, he pulled him out of the bag and set</p>\n<p>him down, and felt his arms and legs.</p>\n<p>“You're rather tough,” says he;</p>\n<p>“but you're all I've got for supper, and you'll not taste bad boiled.</p>\n<p>But body o' me, I've forgot the herbs, and it's bitter you'll taste</p>\n",
        "<p>without herbs.</p>\n<p>Sally!</p>\n<p>Here, I say, Sally!” and he called Mrs.</p>\n<p>Miacca.</p>\n<p>So Mrs.</p>\n<p>Miacca came out of another room and said: “What d'ye want, my</p>\n<p>dear?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh, here's a little boy for supper,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca, “and I've forgot</p>\n<p>the herbs.</p>\n<p>Mind him, will ye, while I go for them.”</p>\n<p>“All right, my love,” says Mrs.</p>\n<p>Miacca, and off he goes.</p>\n<p>Then Tommy Grimes said to Mrs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Miacca: “Does Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca always have</p>\n<p>little boys for supper?”</p>\n<p>“Mostly, my dear,” said Mrs.</p>\n<p>Miacca, “if little boys are bad enough, and</p>\n<p>get in his way.”</p>\n<p>“And don't you have anything else but boy-meat?</p>\n",
        "<p>No pudding?” asked</p>\n<p>Tommy.</p>\n<p>“Ah, I loves pudding,” says Mrs.</p>\n<p>Miacca.</p>\n<p>“But it's not often the likes</p>\n<p>of me gets pudding.”</p>\n<p>“Why, my mother is making a pudding this very day,” said Tommy Grimes,</p>\n",
        "<p>“and I am sure she'd give you some, if I ask her.</p>\n<p>Shall I run and get</p>\n<p>some?”</p>\n<p>“Now, that's a thoughtful boy,” said Mrs.</p>\n<p>Miacca, “only don't be long</p>\n<p>and be sure to be back for supper.”</p>\n<p>So off Tommy pelters, and right glad he was to get off so cheap; and for</p>\n",
        "<p>many a long day he was as good as good could be, and never went round</p>\n<p>the corner of the street.</p>\n<p>But he couldn't always be good; and one day he</p>\n<p>went round the corner, and as luck would have it, he hadn't scarcely got</p>\n<p>round it when Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca grabbed him up, popped him in his bag, and took</p>\n<p>him home.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he got him there, Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca dropped him out; and when he saw him,</p>\n<p>he said: “Ah, you're the youngster what served me and my missus that</p>\n<p>shabby trick, leaving us without any supper.</p>\n<p>Well, you shan't do it</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>I'll watch over you myself.</p>\n",
        "<p>Here, get under the sofa, and I'll</p>\n<p>set on it and watch the pot boil for you.”</p>\n<p>So poor Tommy Grimes had to creep under the sofa, and Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca sat on</p>\n<p>it and waited for the pot to boil.</p>\n<p>And they waited, and they waited, but</p>\n<p>still the pot didn't boil, till at last Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Miacca got tired of waiting,</p>\n<p>and he said: “Here, you under there, I'm not going to wait any longer;</p>\n<p>put out your leg, and I'll stop your giving us the slip.”</p>\n<p>So Tommy put out a leg, and Mr.</p>\n<p>Miacca got a chopper, and chopped it</p>\n<p>off, and pops it in the pot.</p>\n<p>Suddenly he calls out: “Sally, my dear, Sally!” and nobody answered.</p>\n",
        "<p>So</p>\n<p>he went into the next room to look out for Mrs.</p>\n<p>Miacca, and while he was</p>\n<p>there, Tommy crept out from under the sofa and ran out of the door.</p>\n<p>For</p>\n<p>it was a leg of the sofa that he had put out.</p>\n<p>So Tommy Grimes ran home, and he never went round the corner again till</p>\n",
        "<p>he was old enough to go alone.</p>\n<h3>WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT</h3>\n<p>In the reign of the famous King Edward III.</p>\n<p>there was a little boy</p>\n<p>called Dick Whittington, whose father and mother died when he was very</p>\n<p>young.</p>\n<p>As poor Dick was not old enough to work, he was very badly off;</p>\n",
        "<p>he got but little for his dinner, and sometimes nothing at all for</p>\n<p>his breakfast; for the people who lived in the village were very poor</p>\n<p>indeed, and could not spare him much more than the parings of potatoes,</p>\n<p>and now and then a hard crust of bread.</p>\n<p>Now Dick had heard a great many very strange things about the great city</p>\n<p>called London; for the country people at that time thought that folks</p>\n<p>in London were all fine gentlemen and ladies; and that there was singing</p>\n",
        "<p>and music there all day long; and that the streets were all paved with</p>\n<p>gold.</p>\n<p>One day a large waggon and eight horses, all with bells at their heads,</p>\n<p>drove through the village while Dick was standing by the sign-post.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>thought that this waggon must be going to the fine town of London; so</p>\n<p>he took courage, and asked the waggoner to let him walk with him by the</p>\n",
        "<p>side of the waggon.</p>\n<p>As soon as the waggoner heard that poor Dick had</p>\n<p>no father or mother, and saw by his ragged clothes that he could not be</p>\n<p>worse off than he was, he told him he might go if he would, so off they</p>\n<p>set together.</p>\n<p>So Dick got safe to London, and was in such a hurry to see the fine</p>\n<p>streets paved all over with gold, that he did not even stay to thank the</p>\n",
        "<p>kind waggoner; but ran off as fast as his legs would carry him, through</p>\n<p>many of the streets, thinking every moment to come to those that were</p>\n<p>paved with gold; for Dick had seen a guinea three times in his own</p>\n<p>little village, and remembered what a deal of money it brought in</p>\n<p>change; so he thought he had nothing to do but to take up some little</p>\n<p>bits of the pavement, and should then have as much money as he could</p>\n<p>wish for.</p>\n",
        "<p>Poor Dick ran till he was tired, and had quite forgot his friend the</p>\n<p>waggoner; but at last, finding it grow dark, and that every way he</p>\n<p>turned he saw nothing but dirt instead of gold, he, sat down in a dark</p>\n<p>corner and cried himself to sleep.</p>\n<p>Little Dick was all night in the streets; and next morning, being very</p>\n<p>hungry, he got up and walked about, and asked everybody he met to give</p>\n<p>him a halfpenny to keep him from starving; but nobody stayed to answer</p>\n",
        "<p>him, and only two or three gave him a halfpenny; so that the poor boy</p>\n<p>was soon quite weak and faint for the want of victuals.</p>\n<p>In this distress he asked charity of several people, and one of them</p>\n<p>said crossly: “Go to work, for an idle rogue.” “That I will,” says Dick,</p>\n<p>“I will to go work for you, if you will let me.” But the man only cursed</p>\n<p>at him and went on.</p>\n<p>At last a good-natured looking gentleman saw how hungry he looked.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Why</p>\n<p>don't you go to work my lad?” said he to Dick.</p>\n<p>“That I would, but I do</p>\n<p>not know how to get any,” answered Dick.</p>\n<p>“If you are willing, come along</p>\n<p>with me,” said the gentleman, and took him to a hay-field, where Dick</p>\n<p>worked briskly, and lived merrily till the hay was made.</p>\n",
        "<p>After this he found himself as badly off as before; and being almost</p>\n<p>starved again, he laid himself down at the door of Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren,</p>\n<p>a rich merchant.</p>\n<p>Here he was soon seen by the cook-maid, who was an</p>\n<p>ill-tempered creature, and happened just then to be very busy dressing</p>\n<p>dinner for her master and mistress; so she called out to poor Dick:</p>\n",
        "<p>“What business have you there, you lazy rogue?</p>\n<p>there is nothing else but</p>\n<p>beggars; if you do not take yourself away, we will see how you will like</p>\n<p>a sousing of some dish-water; I have some here hot enough to make you</p>\n<p>jump.”</p>\n<p>Just at that time Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren himself came home to dinner; and when</p>\n",
        "<p>he saw a dirty ragged boy lying at the door, he said to him: “Why do</p>\n<p>you lie there, my boy?</p>\n<p>You seem old enough to work; I am afraid you are</p>\n<p>inclined to be lazy.”</p>\n<p>“No, indeed, sir,” said Dick to him, “that is not the case, for I would</p>\n<p>work with all my heart, but I do not know anybody, and I believe I am</p>\n<p>very sick for the want of food.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Poor fellow, get up; let me see what ails you.” Dick now tried to rise,</p>\n<p>but was obliged to lie down again, being too weak to stand, for he had</p>\n<p>not eaten any food for three days, and was no longer able to run about</p>\n<p>and beg a halfpenny of people in the street.</p>\n<p>So the kind merchant</p>\n<p>ordered him to be taken into the house, and have a good dinner given</p>\n<p>him, and be kept to do what work he was able to do for the cook.</p>\n",
        "<p>Little Dick would have lived very happy in this good family if it had</p>\n<p>not been for the ill-natured cook.</p>\n<p>She used to say: “You are under me,</p>\n<p>so look sharp; clean the spit and the dripping-pan, make the fires, wind</p>\n<p>up the jack, and do all the scullery work nimbly, or--” and she would</p>\n<p>shake the ladle at him.</p>\n<p>Besides, she was so fond of basting, that when</p>\n",
        "<p>she had no meat to baste, she would baste poor Dick's head and shoulders</p>\n<p>with a broom, or anything else that happened to fall in her way.</p>\n<p>At last</p>\n<p>her ill-usage of him was told to Alice, Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren's daughter, who</p>\n<p>told the cook she should be turned away if she did not treat him kinder.</p>\n<p>The behaviour of the cook was now a little better; but besides this Dick</p>\n",
        "<p>had another hardship to get over.</p>\n<p>His bed stood in a garret, where there</p>\n<p>were so many holes in the floor and the walls that every night he was</p>\n<p>tormented with rats and mice.</p>\n<p>A gentleman having given Dick a penny for</p>\n<p>cleaning his shoes, he thought he would buy a cat with it.</p>\n<p>The next day</p>\n",
        "<p>he saw a girl with a cat, and asked her, “Will you let me have that cat</p>\n<p>for a penny?” The girl said: “Yes, that I will, master, though she is an</p>\n<p>excellent mouser.”</p>\n<p>Dick hid his cat in the garret, and always took care to carry a part of</p>\n<p>his dinner to her; and in a short time he had no more trouble with the</p>\n<p>rats and mice, but slept quite sound every night.</p>\n<p>Soon after this, his master had a ship ready to sail; and as it was the</p>\n",
        "<p>custom that all his servants should have some chance for good fortune as</p>\n<p>well as himself, he called them all into the parlour and asked them what</p>\n<p>they would send out.</p>\n<p>They all had something that they were willing to venture except poor</p>\n<p>Dick, who had neither money nor goods, and therefore could send nothing.</p>\n<p>For this reason he did not come into the parlour with the rest; but Miss</p>\n<p>Alice guessed what was the matter, and ordered him to be called in.</p>\n",
        "<p>She</p>\n<p>then said: “I will lay down some money for him, from my own purse;” but</p>\n<p>her father told her: “This will not do, for it must be something of his</p>\n<p>own.”</p>\n<p>When poor Dick heard this, he said: “I have nothing but a cat which I</p>\n<p>bought for a penny some time since of a little girl.”</p>\n<p>“Fetch your cat then, my lad,” said Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Fitzwarren, “and let her go.”</p>\n<p>Dick went upstairs and brought down poor puss, with tears in his eyes,</p>\n<p>and gave her to the captain; “For,” he said, “I shall now be kept awake</p>\n<p>all night by the rats and mice.” All the company laughed at Dick's odd</p>\n<p>venture; and Miss Alice, who felt pity for him, gave him some money to</p>\n<p>buy another cat.</p>\n<p>This, and many other marks of kindness shown him by Miss Alice, made the</p>\n",
        "<p>ill-tempered cook jealous of poor Dick, and she began to use him more</p>\n<p>cruelly than ever, and always made game of him for sending his cat to</p>\n<p>sea.</p>\n<p>She asked him: “Do you think your cat will sell for as much money as</p>\n<p>would buy a stick to beat you?”</p>\n<p>At last poor Dick could not bear this usage any longer, and he thought</p>\n<p>he would run away from his place; so he packed up his few things, and</p>\n",
        "<p>started very early in the morning, on All-hallows Day, the first of</p>\n<p>November.</p>\n<p>He walked as far as Holloway; and there sat down on a stone,</p>\n<p>which to this day is called “Whittington's Stone,” and began to think to</p>\n<p>himself which road he should take.</p>\n<p>While he was thinking what he should do, the Bells of Bow Church, which</p>\n<p>at that time were only six, began to ring, and their sound seemed to say</p>\n",
        "<p>to him:</p>\n<p>“Turn again, Whittington, Thrice Lord Mayor of London.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Mayor of London!” said he to himself.</p>\n<p>“Why, to be sure, I would</p>\n<p>put up with almost anything now, to be Lord Mayor of London, and ride in</p>\n<p>a fine coach, when I grow to be a man!</p>\n<p>Well, I will go back, and think</p>\n",
        "<p>nothing of the cuffing and scolding of the old cook, if I am to be Lord</p>\n<p>Mayor of London at last.”</p>\n<p>Dick went back, and was lucky enough to get into the house, and set</p>\n<p>about his work, before the old cook came downstairs.</p>\n<p>We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa.</p>\n<p>The ship with the</p>\n<p>cat on board, was a long time at sea; and was at last driven by the</p>\n",
        "<p>winds on a part of the coast of Barbary, where the only people were the</p>\n<p>Moors, unknown to the English.</p>\n<p>The people came in great numbers to see</p>\n<p>the sailors, because they were of different colour to themselves, and</p>\n<p>treated them civilly; and, when they became better acquainted, were very</p>\n<p>eager to buy the fine things that the ship was loaded with.</p>\n<p>When the captain saw this, he sent patterns of the best things he had to</p>\n",
        "<p>the king of the country; who was so much pleased with them, that he</p>\n<p>sent for the captain to the palace.</p>\n<p>Here they were placed, as it is the</p>\n<p>custom of the country, on rich carpets flowered with gold and silver.</p>\n<p>The king and queen were seated at the upper end of the room; and a</p>\n<p>number of dishes were brought in for dinner.</p>\n<p>They had not sat long, when</p>\n",
        "<p>a vast number of rats and mice rushed in, and devoured all the meat in</p>\n<p>an instant.</p>\n<p>The captain wondered at this, and asked if these vermin were</p>\n<p>not unpleasant.</p>\n<p>“Oh yes,” said they, “very offensive, and the king would give half his</p>\n<p>treasure to be freed of them, for they not only destroy his dinner, as</p>\n<p>you see, but they assault him in his chamber, and even in bed, and</p>\n",
        "<p>so that he is obliged to be watched while he is sleeping, for fear of</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>The captain jumped for joy; he remembered poor Whittington and his</p>\n<p>cat, and told the king he had a creature on board the ship that would</p>\n<p>despatch all these vermin immediately.</p>\n<p>The king jumped so high at the</p>\n<p>joy which the news gave him, that his turban dropped off his head.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Bring this creature to me,” says he; “vermin are dreadful in a court,</p>\n<p>and if she will perform what you say, I will load your ship with gold</p>\n<p>and jewels in exchange for her.”</p>\n<p>The captain, who knew his business, took this opportunity to set forth</p>\n<p>the merits of Miss Puss.</p>\n<p>He told his majesty; “It is not very convenient</p>\n<p>to part with her, as, when she is gone, the rats and mice may destroy</p>\n",
        "<p>the goods in the ship--but to oblige your majesty, I will fetch her.”</p>\n<p>“Run, run!” said the queen; “I am impatient to see the dear creature.”</p>\n<p>Away went the captain to the ship, while another dinner was got ready.</p>\n<p>He put Puss under his arm, and arrived at the place just in time to</p>\n<p>see the table full of rats.</p>\n<p>When the cat saw them, she did not wait for</p>\n<p>bidding, but jumped out of the captain's arms, and in a few minutes laid</p>\n",
        "<p>almost all the rats and mice dead at her feet.</p>\n<p>The rest of them in their</p>\n<p>fright scampered away to their holes.</p>\n<p>The king was quite charmed to get rid so easily of such plagues, and the</p>\n<p>queen desired that the creature who had done them so great a kindness</p>\n<p>might be brought to her, that she might look at her.</p>\n<p>Upon which the</p>\n",
        "<p>captain called: “Pussy, pussy, pussy!” and she came to him.</p>\n<p>He then</p>\n<p>presented her to the queen, who started back, and was afraid to touch</p>\n<p>a creature who had made such a havoc among the rats and mice.</p>\n<p>However,</p>\n<p>when the captain stroked the cat and called: “Pussy, pussy,” the queen</p>\n<p>also touched her and cried: “Putty, putty,” for she had not learned</p>\n",
        "<p>English.</p>\n<p>He then put her down on the queen's lap, where she purred and</p>\n<p>played with her majesty's hand, and then purred herself to sleep.</p>\n<p>The king, having seen the exploits of Mrs.</p>\n<p>Puss, and being informed that</p>\n<p>her kittens would stock the whole country, and keep it free from rats,</p>\n<p>bargained with the captain for the whole ship's cargo, and then gave him</p>\n",
        "<p>ten times as much for the cat as all the rest amounted to.</p>\n<p>The captain then took leave of the royal party, and set sail with a fair</p>\n<p>wind for England, and after a happy voyage arrived safe in London.</p>\n<p>One morning, early, Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren had just come to his counting-house</p>\n<p>and seated himself at the desk, to count over the cash, and settle the</p>\n<p>business for the day, when somebody came tap, tap, at the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Who's</p>\n<p>there?” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren.</p>\n<p>“A friend,” answered the other; “I come to</p>\n<p>bring you good news of your ship _Unicorn_.” The merchant, bustling up</p>\n<p>in such a hurry that he forgot his gout, opened the door, and who should</p>\n<p>he see waiting but the captain and factor, with a cabinet of jewels, and</p>\n",
        "<p>a bill of lading; when he looked at this the merchant lifted up his eyes</p>\n<p>and thanked Heaven for sending him such a prosperous voyage.</p>\n<p>They then told the story of the cat, and showed the rich present</p>\n<p>that the king and queen had sent for her to poor Dick.</p>\n<p>As soon as the</p>\n<p>merchant heard this, he called out to his servants:</p>\n<p>“Go send him in, and tell him of his fame;</p>\n",
        "<p>Pray call him Mr.</p>\n<p>Whittington by name.”</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren now showed himself to be a good man; for when some of</p>\n<p>his servants said so great a treasure was too much for him, he answered:</p>\n<p>“God forbid I should deprive him of the value of a single penny, it is</p>\n<p>his own, and he shall have it to a farthing.” He then sent for Dick,</p>\n",
        "<p>who at that time was scouring pots for the cook, and was quite dirty.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>would have excused himself from coming into the counting-house, saying,</p>\n<p>“The room is swept, and my shoes are dirty and full of hob-nails.” But</p>\n<p>the merchant ordered him to come in.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren ordered a chair to be set for him, and so he began to</p>\n",
        "<p>think they were making game of him, at the same time said to them: “Do</p>\n<p>not play tricks with a poor simple boy, but let me go down again, if you</p>\n<p>please, to my work.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed, Mr.</p>\n<p>Whittington,” said the merchant, “we are all quite in</p>\n<p>earnest with you, and I most heartily rejoice in the news that these</p>\n<p>gentlemen have brought you; for the captain has sold your cat to the</p>\n",
        "<p>King of Barbary, and brought you in return for her more riches than I</p>\n<p>possess in the whole world; and I wish you may long enjoy them!”</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren then told the men to open the great treasure they had</p>\n<p>brought with them; and said: “Mr.</p>\n<p>Whittington has nothing to do but to</p>\n<p>put it in some place of safety.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Poor Dick hardly knew how to behave himself for joy.</p>\n<p>He begged his</p>\n<p>master to take what part of it he pleased, since he owed it all to his</p>\n<p>kindness.</p>\n<p>“No, no,” answered Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren, “this is all your own; and</p>\n<p>I have no doubt but you will use it well.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Dick next asked his mistress, and then Miss Alice, to accept a part of</p>\n<p>his good fortune; but they would not, and at the same time told him</p>\n<p>they felt great joy at his good success.</p>\n<p>But this poor fellow was too</p>\n<p>kind-hearted to keep it all to himself; so he made a present to the</p>\n<p>captain, the mate, and the rest of Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren's servants; and even</p>\n",
        "<p>to the ill-natured old cook.</p>\n<p>After this Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren advised him to send for a proper tailor and</p>\n<p>get himself dressed like a gentleman; and told him he was welcome to</p>\n<p>live in his house till he could provide himself with a better.</p>\n<p>When Whittington's face was washed, his hair curled, his hat cocked, and</p>\n<p>he was dressed in a nice suit of clothes he was as handsome and genteel</p>\n",
        "<p>as any young man who visited at Mr.</p>\n<p>Fitzwarren's; so that Miss Alice,</p>\n<p>who had once been so kind to him, and thought of him with pity, now</p>\n<p>looked upon him as fit to be her sweetheart; and the more so, no doubt,</p>\n<p>because Whittington was now always thinking what he could do to oblige</p>\n<p>her, and making her the prettiest presents that could be.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Fitzwarren soon saw their love for each other, and proposed to join</p>\n<p>them in marriage; and to this they both readily agreed.</p>\n<p>A day for the</p>\n<p>wedding was soon fixed; and they were attended to church by the Lord</p>\n<p>Mayor, the court of aldermen, the sheriffs, and a great number of the</p>\n<p>richest merchants in London, whom they afterwards treated with a very</p>\n<p>rich feast.</p>\n",

        "<p>He entertained this king and his queen at dinner after his conquest of</p>\n<p>France so grandly, that the king said “Never had prince such a subject;”</p>\n<p>when Sir Richard heard this, he said: “Never had subject such a prince.”</p>\n<p>The figure of Sir Richard Whittington with his cat in his arms, carved</p>\n<p>in stone, was to be seen till the year 1780 over the archway of the old</p>\n<p>prison of Newgate, which he built for criminals.</p>\n<h3>THE STRANGE VISITOR</h3>\n",

        "<p>The king mourned her long and faithfully, but</p>\n<p>one day while he was hunting he came across a lady of great beauty, and</p>\n<p>became so much in love with her that he determined to marry her.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>he sent word home that he was going to bring a new queen to Bamborough</p>\n<p>Castle.</p>\n<p>Princess Margaret was not very glad to hear of her mother's place being</p>\n",
        "<p>taken, but she did not repine but did her father's bidding.</p>\n<p>And at the</p>\n<p>appointed day came down to the castle gate with the keys all ready to</p>\n<p>hand over to her stepmother.</p>\n<p>Soon the procession drew near, and the new</p>\n<p>queen came towards Princess Margaret who bowed low and handed her the</p>\n<p>keys of the castle.</p>\n",
        "<p>She stood there with blushing cheeks and eye on</p>\n<p>ground, and said: “O welcome, father dear, to your halls and bowers, and</p>\n<p>welcome to you my new mother, for all that's here is yours,” and again</p>\n<p>she offered the keys.</p>\n<p>One of the king's knights who had escorted the new</p>\n<p>queen, cried out in admiration: “Surely this northern Princess is the</p>\n<p>loveliest of her kind.” At that the new queen flushed up and cried out:</p>\n",
        "<p>“At least your courtesy might have excepted me,” and then she muttered</p>\n<p>below her breath: “I'll soon put an end to her beauty.”</p>\n<p>That same night the queen, who was a noted witch, stole down to a lonely</p>\n<p>dungeon wherein she did her magic and with spells three times three, and</p>\n<p>with passes nine times nine she cast Princess Margaret under her spell.</p>\n<p>And this was her spell:</p>\n<p>I weird ye to be a Laidly Worm,</p>\n",
        "<p>And borrowed shall ye never be,</p>\n<p>Until Childe Wynd, the King's own son</p>\n<p>Come to the Heugh and thrice kiss thee;</p>\n<p>Until the world comes to an end,</p>\n<p>Borrowed shall ye never be.</p>\n<p>So Lady Margaret went to bed a beauteous maiden, and rose up a Laidly</p>\n<p>Worm.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when her maidens came in to dress her in the morning they</p>\n<p>found coiled up on the bed a dreadful dragon, which uncoiled itself</p>\n<p>and came towards them.</p>\n<p>But they ran away shrieking, and the Laidly Worm</p>\n<p>crawled and crept, and crept and crawled till it reached the Heugh or</p>\n<p>rock of the Spindlestone, round which it coiled itself, and lay there</p>\n<p>basking with its terrible snout in the air.</p>\n",
        "<p>Soon the country round about had reason to know of the Laidly Worm of</p>\n<p>Spindleston Heugh.</p>\n<p>For hunger drove the monster out from its cave and it</p>\n<p>used to devour everything it could come across.</p>\n<p>So at last they went to</p>\n<p>a mighty warlock and asked him what they should do.</p>\n<p>Then he consulted</p>\n",
        "<p>his works and his familiar, and told them: “The Laidly Worm is really</p>\n<p>the Princess Margaret and it is hunger that drives her forth to do such</p>\n<p>deeds.</p>\n<p>Put aside for her seven kine, and each day as the sun goes down,</p>\n<p>carry every drop of milk they yield to the stone trough at the foot of</p>\n<p>the Heugh, and the Laidly Worm will trouble the country no longer.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n",
        "<p>if ye would that she be borrowed to her natural shape, and that she who</p>\n<p>bespelled her be rightly punished, send over the seas for her brother,</p>\n<p>Childe Wynd.”</p>\n<p>All was done as the warlock advised, the Laidly Worm lived on the milk</p>\n<p>of the seven kine, and the country was troubled no longer.</p>\n<p>But when</p>\n<p>Childe Wynd heard the news, he swore a mighty oath to rescue his sister</p>\n",
        "<p>and revenge her on her cruel stepmother.</p>\n<p>And three-and-thirty of his men</p>\n<p>took the oath with him.</p>\n<p>Then they set to work and built a long ship, and</p>\n<p>its keel they made of the rowan tree.</p>\n<p>And when all was ready, they out</p>\n<p>with their oars and pulled sheer for Bamborough Keep.</p>\n",
        "<p>But as they got near the keep, the stepmother felt by her magic power</p>\n<p>that something was being wrought against her, so she summoned her</p>\n<p>familiar imps and said: “Childe Wynd is coming over the seas; he must</p>\n<p>never land.</p>\n<p>Raise storms, or bore the hull, but nohow must he touch</p>\n<p>shore.” Then the imps went forth to meet Childe Wynd's ship, but when</p>\n<p>they got near, they found they had no power over the ship, for its keel</p>\n",
        "<p>was made of the rowan tree.</p>\n<p>So back they came to the queen witch, who</p>\n<p>knew not what to do.</p>\n<p>She ordered her men-at-arms to resist Childe Wynd</p>\n<p>if he should land near them, and by her spells she caused the Laidly</p>\n<p>Worm to wait by the entrance of the harbour.</p>\n<p>As the ship came near, the Worm unfolded its coils, and dipping into</p>\n",
        "<p>the sea, caught hold of the ship of Childe Wynd, and banged it off</p>\n<p>the shore.</p>\n<p>Three times Childe Wynd urged his men on to row bravely and</p>\n<p>strong, but each time the Laidly Worm kept it off the shore.</p>\n<p>Then Childe</p>\n<p>Wynd ordered the ship to be put about, and the witch-queen thought he</p>\n<p>had given up the attempt.</p>\n",
        "<p>But instead of that, he only rounded the next</p>\n<p>point and landed safe and sound in Budle Creek, and then, with sword</p>\n<p>drawn and bow bent, rushed up followed by his men, to fight the terrible</p>\n<p>Worm that had kept him from landing.</p>\n<p>But the moment Childe Wynd had landed, the witch-queen's power over the</p>\n<p>Laidly Worm had gone, and she went back to her bower all alone, not an</p>\n<p>imp, nor a man-at-arms to help her, for she knew her hour was come.</p>\n",
        "<p>So</p>\n<p>when Childe Wynd came rushing up to the Laidly Worm it made no attempt</p>\n<p>to stop him or hurt him, but just as he was going to raise his sword to</p>\n<p>slay it, the voice of his own sister Margaret came from its jaws saying:</p>\n<p>“O, quit your sword, unbend your bow,</p>\n<p>And give me kisses three;</p>\n<p>For though I am a poisonous worm,</p>\n",
        "<p>No harm I'll do to thee.”</p>\n<p>Childe Wynd stayed his hand, but he did not know what to think if some</p>\n<p>witchery were not in it.</p>\n<p>Then said the Laidly Worm again:</p>\n<p>“O, quit your sword, unbend your bow,</p>\n<p>And give me kisses three,</p>\n<p>If I'm not won ere set of sun,</p>\n",
        "<p>Won never shall I be.”</p>\n<p>Then Childe Wynd went up to the Laidly Worm and kissed it once; but no</p>\n<p>change came over it.</p>\n<p>Then Childe Wynd kissed it once more; but yet no</p>\n<p>change came over it.</p>\n<p>For a third time he kissed the loathsome thing,</p>\n<p>and with a hiss and a roar the Laidly Worm reared back and before Childe</p>\n",
        "<p>Wynd stood his sister Margaret.</p>\n<p>He wrapped his cloak about her, and then</p>\n<p>went up to the castle with her.</p>\n<p>When he reached the keep, he went off to</p>\n<p>the witch queen's bower, and when he saw her, he touched her with a twig</p>\n<p>of a rowan tree.</p>\n<p>No sooner had he touched her than she shrivelled up and</p>\n",
        "<p>shrivelled up, till she became a huge ugly toad, with bold staring eyes</p>\n<p>and a horrible hiss.</p>\n<p>She croaked and she hissed, and then hopped away</p>\n<p>down the castle steps, and Childe Wynd took his father's place as king,</p>\n<p>and they all lived happy afterwards.</p>\n<p>But to this day, the loathsome toad is seen at times, haunting the</p>\n<p>neighbourhood of Bamborough Keep, and the wicked witch-queen is a Laidly</p>\n",
        "<p>Toad.</p>\n<h3>THE CAT AND THE MOUSE</h3>\n<p>The cat and the mouse</p>\n<p>Play'd in the malt-house:</p>\n<p>The cat bit the mouse's tail off.</p>\n<p>“Pray, puss, give me my tail.” “No,”</p>\n<p>says the cat, “I'll not give you your tail, till you go to the cow, and</p>\n",
        "<p>fetch me some milk.”</p>\n<p>First she leapt and then she ran,</p>\n<p>Till she came to the cow, and thus began:</p>\n<p>“Pray, Cow, give me milk, that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me</p>\n<p>my own tail again.” “No,” said the cow, “I will give you no milk, till</p>\n<p>you go to the farmer, and get me some hay.”</p>\n<p>First she leapt, and then she ran,</p>\n",
        "<p>Till she came to the farmer and thus began:</p>\n<p>“Pray, Farmer, give me hay, that I may give cow hay, that cow may give</p>\n<p>me milk, that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail</p>\n<p>again.” “No,” says the farmer, “I'll give you no hay, till you go to the</p>\n<p>butcher and fetch me some meat.”</p>\n<p>First she leapt, and then she ran,</p>\n<p>Till she came to the butcher, and thus began:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Pray, Butcher, give me meat, that I may give farmer meat, that farmer</p>\n<p>may give me hay, that I may give cow hay, that cow may give me milk,</p>\n<p>that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail again.” “No,”</p>\n<p>says the butcher, “I'll give you no meat, till you go to the baker and</p>\n<p>fetch me some bread.”</p>\n<p>First she leapt and then she ran,</p>\n<p>Till she came to the baker, and thus began:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Pray, Baker, give me bread, that I may give butcher bread, that butcher</p>\n<p>may give me meat, that I may give farmer meat, that farmer may give me</p>\n<p>hay, that I may give cow hay, that cow may give me milk, that I may give</p>\n<p>cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail again.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” says the baker, “I'll give you some bread,</p>\n<p>But if you eat my meal, I'll cut off your head.”</p>\n<p>Then the baker gave mouse bread, and mouse gave butcher bread, and</p>\n",
        "<p>butcher gave mouse meat, and mouse gave farmer meat, and farmer gave</p>\n<p>mouse hay, and mouse gave cow hay, and cow gave mouse milk, and mouse</p>\n<p>gave cat milk, and cat gave mouse her own tail again!</p>\n<h3>THE FISH AND THE RING</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, there was a mighty baron in the North Countrie who was</p>\n<p>a great magician that knew everything that would come to pass.</p>\n<p>So one</p>\n",
        "<p>day, when his little boy was four years old, he looked into the Book of</p>\n<p>Fate to see what would happen to him.</p>\n<p>And to his dismay, he found that</p>\n<p>his son would wed a lowly maid that had just been born in a house under</p>\n<p>the shadow of York Minster.</p>\n<p>Now the Baron knew the father of the little</p>\n<p>girl was very, very poor, and he had five children already.</p>\n",
        "<p>So he called</p>\n<p>for his horse, and rode into York; and passed by the father's house, and</p>\n<p>saw him sitting by the door, sad and doleful.</p>\n<p>So he dismounted and went</p>\n<p>up to him and said: “What is the matter, my good man?” And the man said:</p>\n<p>“Well, your honour, the fact is, I've five children already, and now</p>\n<p>a sixth's come, a little lass, and where to get the bread from to fill</p>\n",
        "<p>their mouths, that's more than I can say.”</p>\n<p>“Don't be downhearted, my man,” said the Baron.</p>\n<p>“If that's your trouble,</p>\n<p>I can help you.</p>\n<p>I'll take away the last little one, and you wont have to</p>\n<p>bother about her.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you kindly, sir,” said the man; and he went in and brought out</p>\n",
        "<p>the lass and gave her to the Baron, who mounted his horse and rode away</p>\n<p>with her.</p>\n<p>And when he got by the bank of the river Ouse, he threw the</p>\n<p>little, thing into the river, and rode off to his castle.</p>\n<p>But the little lass didn't sink; her clothes kept her up for a time, and</p>\n<p>she floated, and she floated, till she was cast ashore just in front of</p>\n<p>a fisherman's hut.</p>\n",
        "<p>There the fisherman found her, and took pity on the</p>\n<p>poor little thing and took her into his house, and she lived there till</p>\n<p>she was fifteen years old, and a fine handsome girl.</p>\n<p>One day it happened that the Baron went out hunting with some companions</p>\n<p>along the banks of the River Ouse, and stopped at the fisherman's hut to</p>\n<p>get a drink, and the girl came out to give it to them.</p>\n<p>They all noticed</p>\n",
        "<p>her beauty, and one of them said to the Baron: “You can read fates,</p>\n<p>Baron, whom will she marry, d'ye think?”</p>\n<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>that's easy to guess,” said the Baron; “some yokel or other.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>I'll cast her horoscope.</p>\n<p>Come here girl, and tell me on what day you</p>\n",
        "<p>were born?”</p>\n<p>“I don't know, sir,” said the girl, “I was picked up just here after</p>\n<p>having been brought down by the river about fifteen years ago.”</p>\n<p>Then the Baron knew who she was, and when they went away, he rode back</p>\n<p>and said to the girl: “Hark ye, girl, I will make your fortune.</p>\n<p>Take</p>\n<p>this letter to my brother in Scarborough, and you will be settled for</p>\n",
        "<p>life.” And the girl took the letter and said she would go.</p>\n<p>Now this was</p>\n<p>what he had written in the letter:</p>\n<p>“Dear Brother,--Take the bearer and put her to death immediately.</p>\n<p>“Yours affectionately,</p>\n<p>“Albert.”</p>\n<p>So soon after the girl set out for Scarborough, and slept for the night</p>\n",
        "<p>at a little inn.</p>\n<p>Now that very night a band of robbers broke into the</p>\n<p>inn, and searched the girl, who had no money, and only the letter.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>they opened this and read it, and thought it a shame.</p>\n<p>The captain of the</p>\n<p>robbers took a pen and paper and wrote this letter:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Dear Brother,--Take the bearer and marry her to my son immediately.</p>\n<p>“Yours affectionately,</p>\n<p>“Albert.”</p>\n<p>And then he gave it to the girl, bidding her begone.</p>\n<p>So she went on</p>\n<p>to the Baron's brother at Scarborough, a noble knight, with whom the</p>\n<p>Baron's son was staying.</p>\n",
        "<p>When she gave the letter to his brother,</p>\n<p>he gave orders for the wedding to be prepared at once, and they were</p>\n<p>married that very day.</p>\n<p>Soon after, the Baron himself came to his brother's castle, and what was</p>\n<p>his surprise to find that the very thing he had plotted against had come</p>\n<p>to pass.</p>\n<p>But he was not to be put off that way; and he took out the girl</p>\n",
        "<p>for a walk, as he said, along the cliffs.</p>\n<p>And when he got her all alone,</p>\n<p>he took her by the arms, and was going to throw her over.</p>\n<p>But she begged</p>\n<p>hard for her life.</p>\n<p>“I have not done anything,” she said: “if you will</p>\n<p>only spare me, I will do whatever you wish.</p>\n",
        "<p>I will never see you or your</p>\n<p>son again till you desire it.” Then the Baron took off his gold ring and</p>\n<p>threw it into the sea, saying: “Never let me see your face till you can</p>\n<p>show me that ring;” and he let her go.</p>\n<p>The poor girl wandered on and on, till at last she came to a great</p>\n<p>noble's castle, and she asked to have some work given to her; and they</p>\n<p>made her the scullion girl of the castle, for she had been used to such</p>\n",
        "<p>work in the fisherman's hut.</p>\n<p>Now one day, who should she see coming up to the noble's house but the</p>\n<p>Baron and his brother and his son, her husband.</p>\n<p>She didn't know what</p>\n<p>to do; but thought they would not see her in the castle kitchen.</p>\n<p>So she</p>\n<p>went back to her work with a sigh, and set to cleaning a huge big fish</p>\n",
        "<p>that was to be boiled for their dinner.</p>\n<p>And, as she was cleaning it,</p>\n<p>she saw something shine inside it, and what do you think she found?</p>\n<p>Why,</p>\n<p>there was the Baron's ring, the very one he had thrown over the cliff</p>\n<p>at Scarborough.</p>\n<p>She was right glad to see it, you may be sure.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then she</p>\n<p>cooked the fish as nicely as she could, and served it up.</p>\n<p>Well, when the fish came on the table, the guests liked it so well that</p>\n<p>they asked the noble who cooked it.</p>\n<p>He said he didn't know, but called</p>\n<p>to his servants: “Ho, there, send up the cook that cooked that fine</p>\n<p>fish.” So they went down to the kitchen and told the girl she was wanted</p>\n",
        "<p>in the hall.</p>\n<p>Then she washed and tidied herself and put the Baron's gold</p>\n<p>ring on her thumb and went up into the hall.</p>\n<p>When the banqueters saw such a young and beautiful cook they were</p>\n<p>surprised.</p>\n<p>But the Baron was in a tower of a temper, and started up as</p>\n<p>if he would do her some violence.</p>\n",
        "<p>So the girl went up to him with her</p>\n<p>hand before her with the ring on it; and she put it down before him on</p>\n<p>the table.</p>\n<p>Then at last the Baron saw that no one could fight against</p>\n<p>Fate, and he handed her to a seat and announced to all the company that</p>\n<p>this was his son's true wife; and he took her and his son home to his</p>\n<p>castle; and they all lived as happy as could be ever afterwards.</p>\n",
        "<h3>THE MAGPIE'S NEST</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme</p>\n<p>And monkeys chewed tobacco,</p>\n<p>And hens took snuff to make them tough,</p>\n<p>And ducks went quack, quack, quack, O!</p>\n<p>All the birds of the air came to the magpie and asked her to teach</p>\n<p>them how to build nests.</p>\n",
        "<p>For the magpie is the cleverest bird of all</p>\n<p>at building nests.</p>\n<p>So she put all the birds round her and began to show</p>\n<p>them how to do it.</p>\n<p>First of all she took some mud and made a sort of</p>\n<p>round cake with it.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that's how it's done,” said the thrush; and away it flew, and so</p>\n",
        "<p>that's how thrushes build their nests.</p>\n<p>Then the magpie took some twigs and arranged them round in the mud.</p>\n<p>“Now I know all about it,” says the blackbird, and off he flew; and</p>\n<p>that's how the blackbirds make their nests to this very day.</p>\n<p>Then the magpie put another layer of mud over the twigs.</p>\n<p>“Oh that's quite obvious,” said the wise owl, and away it flew; and owls</p>\n<p>have never made better nests since.</p>\n",
        "<p>After this the magpie took some twigs and twined them round the outside.</p>\n<p>“The very thing!” said the sparrow, and off he went; so sparrows make</p>\n<p>rather slovenly nests to this day.</p>\n<p>Well, then Madge Magpie took some feathers and stuff and lined the nest</p>\n<p>very comfortably with it.</p>\n<p>“That suits me,” cried the starling, and off it flew; and very</p>\n<p>comfortable nests have starlings.</p>\n",
        "<p>So it went on, every bird taking away some knowledge of how to build</p>\n<p>nests, but, none of them waiting to the end.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Madge Magpie</p>\n<p>went on working and working without, looking up till the only bird that</p>\n<p>remained was the turtle-dove, and that hadn't paid any attention all</p>\n<p>along, but only kept on saying its silly cry “Take two, Taffy, take</p>\n<p>two-o-o-o.”</p>\n",
        "<p>At last the magpie heard this just as she was putting a twig across.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>she said: “One's enough.”</p>\n<p>But the turtle-dove kept on saying: “Take two, Taffy, take two-o-o-o.”</p>\n<p>Then the magpie got angry and said: “One's enough I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Still the turtle-dove cried: “Take two, Taffy, take two-o-o-o.”</p>\n<p>At last, and at last, the magpie looked up and saw nobody near her but</p>\n",
        "<p>the silly turtle-dove, and then she got rare angry and flew away and</p>\n<p>refused to tell the birds how to build nests again.</p>\n<p>And that is why</p>\n<p>different birds build their nests differently.</p>\n<h3>KATE CRACKERNUTS</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time there was a king and a queen, as in many lands have</p>\n<p>been.</p>\n",
        "<p>The king had a daughter, Anne, and the queen had one named Kate,</p>\n<p>but Anne was far bonnier than the queen's daughter, though they loved</p>\n<p>one another like real sisters.</p>\n<p>The queen was jealous of the king's</p>\n<p>daughter being bonnier than her own, and cast about to spoil her beauty.</p>\n<p>So she took counsel of the henwife, who told her to send the lassie to</p>\n<p>her next morning fasting.</p>\n",
        "<p>So next morning early, the queen said to Anne, “Go, my dear, to the</p>\n<p>henwife in the glen, and ask her for some eggs.” So Anne set out, but as</p>\n<p>she passed through the kitchen she saw a crust, and she took and munched</p>\n<p>it as she went along.</p>\n<p>When she came to the henwife's she asked for eggs, as she had been told</p>\n<p>to do; the henwife said to her, “Lift the lid off that pot there and</p>\n<p>see.” The lassie did so, but nothing happened.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Go home to your minnie</p>\n<p>and tell her to keep her larder door better locked,” said the henwife.</p>\n<p>So she went home to the queen and told her what the henwife had said.</p>\n<p>The queen knew from this that the lassie had had something to eat, so</p>\n<p>watched the next morning and sent her away fasting; but the princess saw</p>\n<p>some country-folk picking peas by the roadside, and being very kind she</p>\n<p>spoke to them and took a handful of the peas, which she ate by the way.</p>\n",
        "<p>When she came to the henwife's, she said, “Lift the lid off the pot</p>\n<p>and you'll see.” So Anne lifted the lid but nothing happened.</p>\n<p>Then the</p>\n<p>henwife was rare angry and said to Anne, “Tell your minnie the pot won't</p>\n<p>boil if the fire's away.” So Anne went home and told the queen.</p>\n<p>The third day the queen goes along with the girl herself to the henwife.</p>\n<p>Now, this time, when Anne lifted the lid off the pot, off falls her own</p>\n",
        "<p>pretty head, and on jumps a sheep's head.</p>\n<p>So the queen was now quite satisfied, and went back home.</p>\n<p>Her own daughter, Kate, however, took a fine linen cloth and wrapped it</p>\n<p>round her sister's head and took her by the hand and they both went out</p>\n<p>to seek their fortune.</p>\n<p>They went on, and they went on, and they went</p>\n<p>on, till they came to a castle.</p>\n",
        "<p>Kate knocked at the door and asked for a</p>\n<p>night's lodging for herself and a sick sister.</p>\n<p>They went in and found</p>\n<p>it was a king's castle, who had two sons, and one of them was sickening</p>\n<p>away to death and no one could find out what ailed him.</p>\n<p>And the curious</p>\n<p>thing was that whoever watched him at night was never seen any more.</p>\n",
        "<p>So</p>\n<p>the king had offered a peck of silver to anyone who would stop up with</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>Now Katie was a very brave girl, so she offered to sit up with him.</p>\n<p>Till midnight all goes well.</p>\n<p>As twelve o clock rings, however, the sick</p>\n<p>prince rises, dresses himself, and slips downstairs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Kate followed, but</p>\n<p>he didn't seem to notice her.</p>\n<p>The prince went to the stable, saddled his</p>\n<p>horse, called his hound, jumped into the saddle, and Kate leapt lightly</p>\n<p>up behind him.</p>\n<p>Away rode the prince and Kate through the greenwood,</p>\n<p>Kate, as they pass, plucking nuts from the trees and filling her apron</p>\n",
        "<p>with them.</p>\n<p>They rode on and on till they came to a green hill.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>prince here drew bridle and spoke, “Open, open, green hill, and let the</p>\n<p>young prince in with his horse and his hound,” and Kate added, “and his</p>\n<p>lady him behind.”</p>\n<p>Immediately the green hill opened and they passed in.</p>\n",
        "<p>The prince entered</p>\n<p>a magnificent hall, brightly lighted up, and many beautiful fairies</p>\n<p>surrounded the prince and led him off to the dance.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Kate,</p>\n<p>without being noticed, hid herself behind the door.</p>\n<p>There she sees the</p>\n<p>prince dancing, and dancing, and dancing, till he could dance no longer</p>\n",
        "<p>and fell upon a couch.</p>\n<p>Then the fairies would fan him till he could rise</p>\n<p>again and go on dancing.</p>\n<p>At last the cock crew, and the prince made all haste to get on</p>\n<p>horseback; Kate jumped up behind, and home they rode.</p>\n<p>When the morning</p>\n<p>sun rose they came in and found Kate sitting down by the fire and</p>\n",
        "<p>cracking her nuts.</p>\n<p>Kate said the prince had a good night; but she would</p>\n<p>not sit up another night unless she was to get a peck of gold.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>second night passed as the first had done.</p>\n<p>The prince got up at midnight</p>\n<p>and rode away to the green hill and the fairy ball, and Kate went with</p>\n",
        "<p>him, gathering nuts as they rode through the forest.</p>\n<p>This time she did</p>\n<p>not watch the prince, for she knew he would dance and dance, and dance.</p>\n<p>But she sees a fairy baby playing with a wand, and overhears one of the</p>\n<p>fairies say: “Three strokes of that wand would make Kate's sick sister</p>\n<p>as bonnie as ever she was.” So Kate rolled nuts to the fairy baby, and</p>\n<p>rolled nuts till the baby toddled after the nuts and let fall the wand,</p>\n",
        "<p>and Kate took it up and put it in her apron.</p>\n<p>And at cockcrow they rode</p>\n<p>home as before, and the moment Kate got home to her room she rushed and</p>\n<p>touched Anne three times with the wand, and the nasty sheep's head</p>\n<p>fell off and she was her own pretty self again.</p>\n<p>The third night Kate</p>\n<p>consented to watch, only if she should marry the sick prince.</p>\n",
        "<p>All went</p>\n<p>on as on the first two nights.</p>\n<p>This time the fairy baby was playing with</p>\n<p>a birdie; Kate heard one of the fairies say: “Three bites of that birdie</p>\n<p>would make the sick prince as well as ever he was.” Kate rolled all the</p>\n<p>nuts she had to the fairy baby till the birdie was dropped, and Kate put</p>\n<p>it in her apron.</p>\n",
        "<p>At cockcrow they set off again, but instead of cracking her nuts as</p>\n<p>she used to do, this time Kate plucked the feathers off and cooked</p>\n<p>the birdie.</p>\n<p>Soon there arose a very savoury smell.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” said the sick</p>\n<p>prince, “I wish I had a bite of that birdie,” so Kate gave him a bite of</p>\n<p>the birdie, and he rose up on his elbow.</p>\n",
        "<p>By-and-by he cried out again:</p>\n<p>“Oh, if I had another bite of that birdie!” so Kate gave him another</p>\n<p>bite, and he sat up on his bed.</p>\n<p>Then he said again: “Oh!</p>\n<p>if I only had</p>\n<p>a third bite of that birdie!” So Kate gave him a third bite, and he rose</p>\n<p>quite well, dressed himself, and sat down by the fire, and when the folk</p>\n",
        "<p>came in next morning they found Kate and the young prince cracking nuts</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile his brother had seen Annie and had fallen in love</p>\n<p>with her, as everybody did who saw her sweet pretty face.</p>\n<p>So the sick</p>\n<p>son married the well sister, and the well son married the sick sister,</p>\n<p>and they all lived happy and died happy, and never drank out of a dry</p>\n",

        "<p>It would throw the chairs down, put tables on their backs, rake out</p>\n<p>fires, and do as much mischief as could be.</p>\n<p>But sometimes it would be in</p>\n<p>a good temper, and then!--“What's a Brownie?” you say.</p>\n<p>Oh, it's a kind</p>\n<p>of a sort of a Bogle, but it isn't so cruel as a Redcap!</p>\n<p>What!</p>\n",
        "<p>you don't</p>\n<p>know what's a Bogle or a Redcap!</p>\n<p>Ah, me!</p>\n<p>what's the world a-coming to?</p>\n<p>Of course a Brownie is a funny little thing, half man, half goblin, with</p>\n<p>pointed ears and hairy hide.</p>\n<p>When you bury a treasure, you scatter over</p>\n",
        "<p>it blood drops of a newly slain kid or lamb, or, better still, bury the</p>\n<p>animal with the treasure, and a Brownie will watch over it for you, and</p>\n<p>frighten everybody else away.</p>\n<p>Where was I?</p>\n<p>Well, as I was a-saying, the Brownie at Hilton Hall would</p>\n<p>play at mischief, but if the servants laid out for it a bowl of cream,</p>\n<p>or a knuckle cake spread with honey, it would clear away things for</p>\n",
        "<p>them, and make everything tidy in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>One night, however, when</p>\n<p>the servants had stopped up late, they heard a noise in the kitchen,</p>\n<p>and, peeping in, saw the Brownie swinging to and fro on the Jack chain,</p>\n<p>and saying:</p>\n<p>“Woe's me!</p>\n<p>woe's me!</p>\n",
        "<p>The acorn's not yet</p>\n<p>Fallen from the tree,</p>\n<p>That's to grow the wood,</p>\n<p>That's to make the cradle,</p>\n<p>That's to rock the bairn,</p>\n<p>That's to grow to the man,</p>\n<p>That's to lay me.</p>\n",
        "<p>Woe's me!</p>\n<p>woe's me!”</p>\n<p>So they took pity on the poor Brownie, and asked the nearest henwife</p>\n<p>what they should do to send it away.</p>\n<p>“That's easy enough,” said the</p>\n<p>henwife, and told them that a Brownie that's paid for its service, in</p>\n<p>aught that's not perishable, goes away at once.</p>\n",
        "<p>So they made a cloak of</p>\n<p>Lincoln green, with a hood to it, and put it by the hearth and watched.</p>\n<p>They saw the Brownie come up, and seeing the hood and cloak, put them</p>\n<p>on, and frisk about, dancing on one leg and saying:</p>\n<p>“I've taken your cloak, I've taken your hood;</p>\n<p>The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good.”</p>\n<p>And with that it vanished, and was never seen or heard of afterwards.</p>\n",
        "<h3>THE ASS, THE TABLE, AND THE STICK</h3>\n<p>A lad named Jack was once so unhappy at home through his father's</p>\n<p>ill-treatment, that he made up his mind to run away and seek his fortune</p>\n<p>in the wide world.</p>\n<p>He ran, and he ran, till he could run no longer, and then he ran right</p>\n<p>up against a little old woman who was gathering sticks.</p>\n<p>He was too much</p>\n",
        "<p>out of breath to beg pardon, but the woman was good-natured, and she</p>\n<p>said he seemed to be a likely lad, so she would take him to be her</p>\n<p>servant, and would pay him well.</p>\n<p>He agreed, for he was very hungry,</p>\n<p>and she brought him to her house in the wood, where he served her for a</p>\n<p>twelvemonths and a day.</p>\n<p>When the year had passed, she called him to her, and said she had good</p>\n",
        "<p>wages for him.</p>\n<p>So she presented him with an ass out of the stable, and</p>\n<p>he had but to pull Neddy's ears to make him begin at once to ee--aw!</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when he brayed there dropped from his mouth silver sixpences, and half</p>\n<p>crowns, and golden guineas.</p>\n<p>The lad was well pleased with the wage he had received, and away he rode</p>\n",
        "<p>till he reached an inn.</p>\n<p>There he ordered the best of everything, and</p>\n<p>when the innkeeper refused to serve him without being paid beforehand,</p>\n<p>the boy went off to the stable, pulled the ass's ears and obtained his</p>\n<p>pocket full of money.</p>\n<p>The host had watched all this through a crack</p>\n<p>in the door, and when night came on he put an ass of his own for the</p>\n",
        "<p>precious Neddy of the poor youth.</p>\n<p>So Jack without knowing that any</p>\n<p>change had been made, rode away next morning to his father's house.</p>\n<p>Now, I must tell you that near his home dwelt a poor widow with an only</p>\n<p>daughter.</p>\n<p>The lad and the maiden were fast friends and true loves; but</p>\n<p>when Jack asked his father's leave to marry the girl, “Never till you</p>\n",
        "<p>have the money to keep her,” was the reply.</p>\n<p>“I have that, father,” said</p>\n<p>the lad, and going to the ass he pulled its long ears; well, he pulled,</p>\n<p>and he pulled, till one of them came off in his hands; but Neddy, though</p>\n<p>he hee-hawed and he hee-hawed let fall no half crowns or guineas.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>father picked up a hay-fork and beat his son out of the house.</p>\n",
        "<p>I promise</p>\n<p>you he ran.</p>\n<p>Ah!</p>\n<p>he ran and ran till he came bang against the door, and</p>\n<p>burst it open, and there he was in a joiner's shop.</p>\n<p>“You're a likely</p>\n<p>lad,” said the joiner; “serve me for a twelvemonths and a day and I will</p>\n",
        "<p>pay you well.'” So he agreed, and served the carpenter for a year and</p>\n<p>a day.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said the master, “I will give you your wage;” and he</p>\n<p>presented him with a table, telling him he had but to say, “Table, be</p>\n<p>covered,” and at once it would be spread with lots to eat and drink.</p>\n<p>Jack hitched the table on his back, and away he went with it till he</p>\n<p>came to the inn.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well, host,” shouted he, “my dinner to-day, and that</p>\n<p>of the best.”</p>\n<p>“Very sorry, but there is nothing in the house but ham and eggs.”</p>\n<p>“Ham and eggs for me!” exclaimed Jack.</p>\n<p>“I can do better than</p>\n<p>that.--Come, my table, be covered!”</p>\n<p>At once the table was spread with turkey and sausages, roast mutton,</p>\n",
        "<p>potatoes, and greens.</p>\n<p>The publican opened his eyes, but he said nothing,</p>\n<p>not he.</p>\n<p>That night he fetched down from his attic a table very like that of</p>\n<p>Jack, and exchanged the two.</p>\n<p>Jack, none the wiser, next morning hitched</p>\n<p>the worthless table on to his back and carried it home.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Now, father,</p>\n<p>may I marry my lass?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Not unless you can keep her,” replied the father.</p>\n<p>“Look here!”</p>\n<p>exclaimed Jack.</p>\n<p>“Father, I have a table which does all my bidding.”</p>\n<p>“Let me see it,” said the old man.</p>\n",
        "<p>The lad set it in the middle of the room, and bade it be covered; but</p>\n<p>all in vain, the table remained bare.</p>\n<p>In a rage, the father caught the</p>\n<p>warming-pan down from the wall and warmed his son's back with it so that</p>\n<p>the boy fled howling from the house, and ran and ran till he came to a</p>\n<p>river and tumbled in.</p>\n<p>A man picked him out and bade him assist him in</p>\n",
        "<p>making a bridge over the river; and how do you think he was doing it?</p>\n<p>Why, by casting a tree across; so Jack climbed up to the top of the tree</p>\n<p>and threw his weight on it, so that when the man had rooted the tree up,</p>\n<p>Jack and the tree-head dropped on the farther bank.</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” said the man; “and now for what you have done I will pay</p>\n<p>you;” so saying, he tore a branch from the tree, and fettled it up into</p>\n<p>a club with his knife.</p>\n",
        "<p>“There,” exclaimed he; “take this stick, and when</p>\n<p>you say to it, 'Up stick and bang him,' it will knock any one down who</p>\n<p>angers you.”</p>\n<p>The lad was overjoyed to get this stick--so away he went with it to the</p>\n<p>inn, and as soon as the publican, appeared, “Up stick and bang him!” was</p>\n<p>his cry.</p>\n<p>At the word the cudgel flew from his hand and battered the</p>\n",
        "<p>old publican on the back, rapped his head, bruised his arms tickled his</p>\n<p>ribs, till he fell groaning on the floor; still the stick belaboured</p>\n<p>the prostrate man, nor would Jack call it off till he had got back the</p>\n<p>stolen ass and table.</p>\n<p>Then he galloped home on the ass, with the table</p>\n<p>on his shoulders, and the stick in his hand.</p>\n<p>When he arrived there he</p>\n",
        "<p>found his father was dead, so he brought his ass into the stable, and</p>\n<p>pulled its ears till he had filled the manger with money.</p>\n<p>It was soon known through the town that Jack had returned rolling in</p>\n<p>wealth, and accordingly all the girls in the place set their caps at</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Jack, “I shall marry the richest lass in the place; so</p>\n<p>tomorrow do you all come in front of my house with your money in your</p>\n",
        "<p>aprons.”</p>\n<p>Next morning the street was full of girls with aprons held out, and gold</p>\n<p>and silver in them; but Jack's own sweetheart was among them, and she</p>\n<p>had neither gold nor silver, nought but two copper pennies, that was all</p>\n<p>she had.</p>\n<p>“Stand aside, lass;” said Jack to her, speaking roughly.</p>\n<p>“Thou hast no</p>\n",
        "<p>silver nor gold--stand off from the rest.” She obeyed, and the tears ran</p>\n<p>down her cheeks, and filled her apron with diamonds.</p>\n<p>“Up stick and bang them!” exclaimed Jack; whereupon the cudgel leaped</p>\n<p>up, and running along the line of girls, knocked them all on the heads</p>\n<p>and left them senseless on the pavement.</p>\n<p>Jack took all their money and</p>\n<p>poured it into his truelove's lap.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Now, lass,” he exclaimed, “thou art</p>\n<p>the richest, and I shall marry thee.”</p>\n<h3>FAIRY OINTMENT</h3>\n<p>Dame Goody was a nurse that looked after sick people, and minded babies.</p>\n<p>One night she was woke up at midnight, and when she went downstairs,</p>\n<p>she saw a strange squinny-eyed, little ugly old fellow, who asked her</p>\n<p>to come to his wife who was too ill to mind her baby.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dame Goody didn't</p>\n<p>like the look of the old fellow, but business is business; so she popped</p>\n<p>on her things, and went down to him.</p>\n<p>And when she got down to him, he</p>\n<p>whisked her up on to a large coal-black horse with fiery eyes, that</p>\n<p>stood at the door; and soon they were going at a rare pace, Dame Goody</p>\n<p>holding on to the old fellow like grim death.</p>\n",
        "<p>They rode, and they rode, till at last they stopped before a cottage</p>\n<p>door.</p>\n<p>So they got down and went in and found the good woman abed with</p>\n<p>the children playing about; and the babe, a fine bouncing boy, beside</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>Dame Goody took the babe, which was as fine a baby boy as you'd wish to</p>\n<p>see.</p>\n",
        "<p>The mother, when she handed the baby to Dame Goody to mind, gave</p>\n<p>her a box of ointment, and told her to stroke the baby's eyes with it</p>\n<p>as soon as it opened them.</p>\n<p>After a while it began to open its eyes.</p>\n<p>Dame</p>\n<p>Goody saw that it had squinny eyes just like its father.</p>\n<p>So she took the</p>\n",
        "<p>box of ointment and stroked its two eyelids with it.</p>\n<p>But she couldn't</p>\n<p>help wondering what it was for, as she had never seen such a thing done</p>\n<p>before.</p>\n<p>So she looked to see if the others were looking, and, when they</p>\n<p>were not noticing she stroked her own right eyelid with the ointment.</p>\n<p>No sooner had she done so, than everything seemed changed about her.</p>\n",
        "<p>The cottage became elegantly furnished.</p>\n<p>The mother in the bed was a</p>\n<p>beautiful lady, dressed up in white silk.</p>\n<p>The little baby was still more</p>\n<p>beautiful than before, and its clothes were made of a sort of silvery</p>\n<p>gauze.</p>\n<p>Its little brothers and sisters around the bed were flat-nosed</p>\n",
        "<p>imps with pointed ears, who made faces at one another, and scratched</p>\n<p>their polls.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they would pull the sick lady's ears with their</p>\n<p>long and hairy paws.</p>\n<p>In fact, they were up to all kinds of mischief; and</p>\n<p>Dame Goody knew that she had got into a house of pixies.</p>\n<p>But she said</p>\n",
        "<p>nothing to nobody, and as soon as the lady was well enough to mind the</p>\n<p>baby, she asked the old fellow to take her back home.</p>\n<p>So he came round</p>\n<p>to the door with the coal-black horse with eyes of fire, and off they</p>\n<p>went as fast as before, or perhaps a little faster, till they came to</p>\n<p>Dame Goody's cottage, where the squinny-eyed old fellow lifted her down</p>\n<p>and left her, thanking her civilly enough, and paying her more than she</p>\n",
        "<p>had ever been paid before for such service.</p>\n<p>Now next day happened to be market-day, and as Dame Goody had been away</p>\n<p>from home, she wanted many things in the house, and trudged off to get</p>\n<p>them at the market.</p>\n<p>As she was buying the things she wanted, who</p>\n<p>should she see but the squinny-eyed old fellow who had taken her on the</p>\n<p>coal-black horse.</p>\n",
        "<p>And what do you think he was doing?</p>\n<p>Why he went about</p>\n<p>from stall to stall taking up things from each, here some fruit, and</p>\n<p>there some eggs, and so on; and no one seemed to take any notice.</p>\n<p>Now Dame Goody did not think it her business to interfere, but she</p>\n<p>thought she ought not to let so good a customer pass without speaking.</p>\n<p>So she ups to him and bobs a curtsey and said: “Gooden, sir, I hopes as</p>\n",
        "<p>how your good lady and the little one are as well as----”</p>\n<p>But she couldn't finish what she was a-saying, for the funny old fellow</p>\n<p>started back in surprise, and he says to her, says he: “What!</p>\n<p>do you see</p>\n<p>me today?”</p>\n<p>“See you,” says she, “why, of course I do, as plain as the sun in the</p>\n<p>skies, and what's more,” says she, “I see you are busy too, into the</p>\n",
        "<p>bargain.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you see too much,” said he; “now, pray, with which eye do you see</p>\n<p>all this?”</p>\n<p>“With the right eye to be sure,” said she, as proud as can be to find</p>\n<p>him out.</p>\n<p>“The ointment!</p>\n<p>The ointment!” cried the old pixy thief.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Take that for</p>\n<p>meddling with what don't concern you: you shall see me no more.” And</p>\n<p>with that he struck her on her right eye, and she couldn't see him any</p>\n<p>more; and, what was worse, she was blind on the right side from that</p>\n<p>hour till the day of her death.</p>\n<h3>THE WELL OF THE WORLD'S END</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it wasn't in my</p>\n",
        "<p>time, nor in your time, nor any one else's time, there was a girl whose</p>\n<p>mother had died, and her father had married again.</p>\n<p>And her stepmother</p>\n<p>hated her because she was more beautiful than herself, and she was very</p>\n<p>cruel to her.</p>\n<p>She used to make her do all the servant's work, and never</p>\n<p>let her have any peace.</p>\n",
        "<p>At last, one day, the stepmother thought to get</p>\n<p>rid of her altogether; so she handed her a sieve and said to her: “Go,</p>\n<p>fill it at the Well of the World's End and bring it home to me full,</p>\n<p>or woe betide you.” For she thought she would never be able to find the</p>\n<p>Well of the World's End, and, if she did, how could she bring home a</p>\n<p>sieve full of water?</p>\n<p>Well, the girl started off, and asked every one she met to tell her</p>\n",
        "<p>where was the Well of the World's End.</p>\n<p>But nobody knew, and she didn't</p>\n<p>know what to do, when a queer little old woman, all bent double, told</p>\n<p>her where it was, and how she could get to it.</p>\n<p>So she did what the old</p>\n<p>woman told her, and at last arrived at the Well of the World's End.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n",
        "<p>when she dipped the sieve in the cold, cold water, it all ran out again.</p>\n<p>She tried and she tried again, but every time it was the same; and at</p>\n<p>last she sate down and cried as if her heart would break.</p>\n<p>Suddenly she heard a croaking voice, and she looked up and saw a great</p>\n<p>frog with goggle eyes looking at her and speaking to her.</p>\n<p>“What's the matter, dearie?” it said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, dear, oh dear,” she said, “my stepmother has sent me all this long</p>\n",
        "<p>way to fill this sieve with water from the Well of the World's End, and</p>\n<p>I can't fill it no how at all.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the frog, “if you promise me to do whatever I bid you for a</p>\n<p>whole night long, I'll tell you how to fill it.”</p>\n<p>So the girl agreed, and then the frog said:</p>\n<p>“Stop it with moss and daub it with clay,</p>\n<p>And then it will carry the water away;”</p>\n",
        "<p>and then it gave a hop, skip and jump, and went flop into the Well of</p>\n<p>the World's End.</p>\n<p>So the girl looked about for some moss, and lined the bottom of the</p>\n<p>sieve with it, and over that she put some clay, and then she dipped it</p>\n<p>once again into the Well of the World's End; and this time, the water</p>\n<p>didn't run out, and she turned to go away.</p>\n<p>Just then the frog popped up its head out of the Well of the World's</p>\n",
        "<p>End, and said: “Remember your promise.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said the girl; for thought she, “what harm can a frog do</p>\n<p>me?”</p>\n<p>So she went back to her stepmother, and brought the sieve full of water</p>\n<p>from the Well of the World's End.</p>\n<p>The stepmother was fine and angry, but</p>\n<p>she said nothing at all.</p>\n",
        "<p>That very evening they heard something tap tapping at the door low down,</p>\n<p>and a voice cried out:</p>\n<p>“Open the door, my hinny, my heart,</p>\n<p>Open the door, my own darling;</p>\n<p>Mind you the words that you and I spoke,</p>\n<p>Down in the meadow, at the World's End Well.”</p>\n<p>“Whatever can that be?” cried out the stepmother, and the girl had to</p>\n",
        "<p>tell her all about it, and what she had promised the frog.</p>\n<p>“Girls must keep their promises,” said the stepmother.</p>\n<p>“Go and open the</p>\n<p>door this instant.” For she was glad the girl would have to obey a nasty</p>\n<p>frog.</p>\n<p>So the girl went and opened the door, and there was the frog from the</p>\n<p>Well of the World's End.</p>\n",
        "<p>And it hopped, and it skipped, and it jumped,</p>\n<p>till it reached the girl, and then it said:</p>\n<p>“Lift me to your knee, my hinny, my heart;</p>\n<p>Lift me to your knee, my own darling;</p>\n<p>Remember the words you and I spoke,</p>\n<p>Down in the meadow by the World's End Well.”</p>\n<p>But the girl didn't like to, till her stepmother said “Lift it up this</p>\n",
        "<p>instant, you hussy!</p>\n<p>Girls must keep their promises!”</p>\n<p>So at last she lifted the frog up on to her lap, and it lay there for a</p>\n<p>time, till at last it said:</p>\n<p>“Give me some supper, my hinny, my heart,</p>\n<p>Give me some supper, my darling;</p>\n<p>Remember the words you and I spake,</p>\n",
        "<p>In the meadow, by the Well of the World's End.”</p>\n<p>Well, she didn't mind doing that, so she got it a bowl of milk and</p>\n<p>bread, and fed it well.</p>\n<p>And when the frog, had finished, it said:</p>\n<p>“Go with me to bed, my hinny, my heart,</p>\n<p>Go with me to bed, my own darling;</p>\n<p>Mind you the words you spake to me,</p>\n",
        "<p>Down by the cold well, so weary.”</p>\n<p>But that the girl wouldn't do, till her stepmother said: “Do what you</p>\n<p>promised, girl; girls must keep their promises.</p>\n<p>Do what you're bid, or</p>\n<p>out you go, you and your froggie.”</p>\n<p>So the girl took the frog with her to bed, and kept it as far away from</p>\n<p>her as she could.</p>\n",
        "<p>Well, just as the day was beginning to break what</p>\n<p>should the frog say but:</p>\n<p>“Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart,</p>\n<p>Chop off my head, my own darling;</p>\n<p>Remember the promise you made to me,</p>\n<p>Down by the cold well so weary.”</p>\n<p>At first the girl wouldn't, for she thought of what the frog had done</p>\n",
        "<p>for her at the Well of the World's End.</p>\n<p>But when the frog said the words</p>\n<p>over again, she went and took an axe and chopped off its head, and lo!</p>\n<p>and behold, there stood before her a handsome young prince, who told her</p>\n<p>that he had been enchanted by a wicked magician, and he could never be</p>\n<p>unspelled till some girl would do his bidding for a whole night, and</p>\n<p>chop off his head at the end of it.</p>\n",

        "<p>That's all.</p>\n<h3>THE THREE HEADS OF THE WELL</h3>\n<p>Long before Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, there reigned in</p>\n<p>the eastern part of England a king who kept his Court at Colchester.</p>\n<p>In</p>\n<p>the midst of all his glory, his queen died, leaving behind her an only</p>\n<p>daughter, about fifteen years of age, who for her beauty and kindness</p>\n",
        "<p>was the wonder of all that knew her.</p>\n<p>But the king hearing of a lady who</p>\n<p>had likewise an only daughter, had a mind to marry her for the sake of</p>\n<p>her riches, though she was old, ugly, hook-nosed, and hump-backed.</p>\n<p>Her</p>\n<p>daughter was a yellow dowdy, full of envy and ill-nature; and, in short,</p>\n<p>was much of the same mould as her mother.</p>\n",
        "<p>But in a few weeks the king,</p>\n<p>attended by the nobility and gentry, brought his deformed bride to the</p>\n<p>palace, where the marriage rites were performed.</p>\n<p>They had not been long</p>\n<p>in the Court before they set the king against his own beautiful daughter</p>\n<p>by false reports.</p>\n<p>The young princess having lost her father's love, grew</p>\n",
        "<p>weary of the Court, and one day, meeting with her father in the garden,</p>\n<p>she begged him, with tears in her eyes, to let her go and seek her</p>\n<p>fortune; to which the king consented, and ordered her mother-in-law to</p>\n<p>give her what she pleased.</p>\n<p>She went to the queen, who gave her a canvas</p>\n<p>bag of brown bread and hard cheese, with a bottle of beer; though this</p>\n<p>was but a pitiful dowry for a king's daughter.</p>\n",
        "<p>She took it, with</p>\n<p>thanks, and proceeded on her journey, passing through groves, woods,</p>\n<p>and valleys, till at length she saw an old man sitting on a stone at the</p>\n<p>mouth of a cave, who said: “Good morrow, fair maiden, whither away so</p>\n<p>fast?”</p>\n<p>“Aged father,” says she, “I am going to seek my fortune.”</p>\n<p>“What have you got in your bag and bottle?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“In my bag I have got bread and cheese, and in my bottle good small</p>\n<p>beer.</p>\n<p>Would you like to have some?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said he, “with all my heart.”</p>\n<p>With that the lady pulled out her provisions, and bade him eat and</p>\n<p>welcome.</p>\n<p>He did so, and gave her many thanks, and said: “There is a</p>\n",
        "<p>thick thorny hedge before you, which you cannot get through, but take</p>\n<p>this wand in your hand, strike it three times, and say, 'Pray, hedge,</p>\n<p>let me come through,' and it will open immediately; then, a little</p>\n<p>further, you will find a well; sit down on the brink of it, and there</p>\n<p>will come up three golden heads, which will speak; and whatever they</p>\n<p>require, that do.” Promising she would, she took her leave of him.</p>\n<p>Coming to the hedge and using the old man's wand, it divided, and let</p>\n",
        "<p>her through; then, coming to the well, she had no sooner sat down than a</p>\n<p>golden head came up singing:</p>\n<p>“Wash me, and comb me,</p>\n<p>And lay me down softly.</p>\n<p>And lay me on a bank to dry,</p>\n<p>That I may look pretty,</p>\n<p>When somebody passes by.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Yes,” said she, and taking it in her lap combed it with a silver comb,</p>\n<p>and then placed it upon a primrose bank.</p>\n<p>Then up came a second and a</p>\n<p>third head, saying the same as the former.</p>\n<p>So she did the same for them,</p>\n<p>and then, pulling out her provisions, sat down to eat her dinner.</p>\n<p>Then said the heads one to another: “What shall we weird for this damsel</p>\n",
        "<p>who has used us so kindly?”</p>\n<p>The first said: “I weird her to be so beautiful that she shall charm the</p>\n<p>most powerful prince in the world.”</p>\n<p>The second said: “I weird her such a sweet voice as shall far exceed the</p>\n<p>nightingale.”</p>\n<p>The third said: “My gift shall be none of the least, as she is a king's</p>\n<p>daughter, I'll weird her so fortunate that she shall become queen to the</p>\n",
        "<p>greatest prince that reigns.”</p>\n<p>She then let them down into the well again, and so went on her journey.</p>\n<p>She had not travelled long before she saw a king hunting in the park</p>\n<p>with his nobles.</p>\n<p>She would have avoided him, but the king, having caught</p>\n<p>a sight of her, approached, and what with her beauty and sweet voice,</p>\n<p>fell desperately in love with her, and soon induced her to marry him.</p>\n",
        "<p>This king finding that she was the King of Colchester's daughter,</p>\n<p>ordered some chariots to be got ready, that he might pay the king, his</p>\n<p>father-in-law, a visit.</p>\n<p>The chariot in which the king and queen rode</p>\n<p>was adorned with rich gems of gold.</p>\n<p>The king, her father, was at first</p>\n<p>astonished that his daughter had been so fortunate, till the young</p>\n",
        "<p>king let him know of all that had happened.</p>\n<p>Great was the joy at</p>\n<p>Court amongst all, with the exception of the queen and her club-footed</p>\n<p>daughter, who were ready to burst with envy.</p>\n<p>The rejoicings, with</p>\n<p>feasting and dancing, continued many days.</p>\n<p>Then at length they returned</p>\n",
        "<p>home with the dowry her father gave her.</p>\n<p>The hump-backed princess, perceiving that her sister had been so lucky</p>\n<p>in seeking her fortune, wanted to do the same; so she told her mother,</p>\n<p>and all preparations were made, and she was furnished with rich dresses,</p>\n<p>and with sugar, almonds, and sweetmeats, in great quantities, and a</p>\n<p>large bottle of Malaga sack.</p>\n<p>With these she went the same road as</p>\n",
        "<p>her sister; and coming near the cave, the old man said: “Young woman,</p>\n<p>whither so fast?”</p>\n<p>“What's that to you?” said she.</p>\n<p>“Then,” said he, “what have you in your bag and bottle?”</p>\n<p>She answered: “Good things, which you shall not be troubled with.”</p>\n<p>“Won't you give me some?” said he.</p>\n<p>“No, not a bit, nor a drop, unless it would choke you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The old man frowned, saying: “Evil fortune attend ye!”</p>\n<p>Going on, she came to the hedge, through which she espied a gap, and</p>\n<p>thought to pass through it; but the hedge closed, and the, thorns</p>\n<p>ran into her flesh, so that it was with great difficulty that she</p>\n<p>got through.</p>\n<p>Being now all over blood, she searched for water to wash</p>\n<p>herself, and, looking round, she saw the well.</p>\n",
        "<p>She sat down on the brink</p>\n<p>of it, and one of the heads came up, saying: “Wash me, comb me, and lay</p>\n<p>me down softly,” as before, but she banged it with her bottle, saying,</p>\n<p>“Take that for your washing.” So the second and third heads came up,</p>\n<p>and met with no better treatment than the first.</p>\n<p>Whereupon the heads</p>\n<p>consulted among themselves what evils to plague her with for such usage.</p>\n",
        "<p>The first said: “Let her be struck with leprosy in her face.”</p>\n<p>The second: “Let her voice be as harsh as a corn-crake's.”</p>\n<p>The third said: “Let her have for husband but a poor country cobbler.”</p>\n<p>Well, she goes on till she came to a town, and it being market-day, the</p>\n<p>people looked at her, and, seeing such a mangy face, and hearing such</p>\n<p>a squeaky voice, all fled but a poor country cobbler.</p>\n<p>Now he not long</p>\n",
        "<p>before had mended the shoes of an old hermit, who, having no money</p>\n<p>gave him a box of ointment for the cure of the leprosy, and a bottle of</p>\n<p>spirits for a harsh voice.</p>\n<p>So the cobbler having a mind to do an act of</p>\n<p>charity, was induced to go up to her and ask her who she was.</p>\n<p>“I am,” said she, “the King of Colchester's daughter-in-law.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the cobbler, “if I restore you to your natural complexion,</p>\n",
        "<p>and make a sound cure both in face and voice, will you in reward take me</p>\n<p>for a husband?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, friend,” replied she, “with all my heart!”</p>\n<p>With this the cobbler applied the remedies, and they made her well in</p>\n<p>a few weeks; after which they were married, and so set forward for the</p>\n<p>Court at Colchester.</p>\n<p>When the queen found that her daughter had married</p>\n",
        "<p>nothing but a poor cobbler, she hanged herself in wrath.</p>\n<p>The death of</p>\n<p>the queen so pleased the king, who was glad to get rid of her so soon,</p>\n<p>that he gave the cobbler a hundred pounds to quit the Court with his</p>\n<p>lady, and take to a remote part of the kingdom, where he lived many</p>\n<p>years mending shoes, his wife spinning the thread for him.</p>\n<h3>OYEZ-OYEZ-OYEZ</h3>\n",

        "<p>The latter reference is to the cry of the King of Elfland.</p>\n<p>That some</p>\n<p>such story was current in England in Shakespeare's time, is proved by</p>\n<p>that curious _mélange_ of nursery tales, Peele's _The Old Wives' Tale_.</p>\n<p>The main plot of this is the search of two brothers, Calypha and</p>\n<p>Thelea, for a lost sister, Delia, who has been bespelled by a sorcerer,</p>\n<p>Sacrapant (the names are taken from the “Orlando Furioso”).</p>\n",

        "<p>The verses imbedded</p>\n<p>in the _Arabian Nights_ give them something of the character of a</p>\n<p>_cante-fable_, and the same may be said of the Indian and Persian</p>\n<p>story-books, though the verse is usually of a sententious and moral</p>\n<p>kind, as in the _gâthas_ of the Buddhist Jatakas.</p>\n<p>Even as remote as</p>\n<p>Zanzibar, Mr.</p>\n",

        "<p>there seems to be great probability that originally all folk-tales of a</p>\n<p>serious character were interspersed with rhyme, and took therefore the</p>\n<p>form of the _cante-fable_.</p>\n<p>It is indeed unlikely that the ballad</p>\n<p>itself began as continuous verse, and the _cante-fable_ is probably</p>\n<p>the protoplasm out of which both ballad and folk-tale have been</p>\n<p>differentiated, the ballad by omitting the narrative prose, the</p>\n",

        "<p>MacRitchie's view is that the elves, trolls, and</p>\n<p>fairies represented in popular tradition are really the mound-dwellers,</p>\n<p>whose remains have been discovered in some abundance in the form of</p>\n<p>green hillocks, which have been artificially raised over a long and low</p>\n<p>passage leading to a central chamber open to the sky.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>MacRitchie</p>\n",
