        "<h3>The following are the sources from which the present translation has\nbeen prepared:—</h3>\n<p>Babrii Fabulæ Æsopeæ.</p>\n<p>George Cornewall Lewis.</p>\n<p>Oxford, 1846.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion And The Mouse</h3>\n<p>A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face.</p>\n<p>Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse</p>\n<p>piteously entreated, saying: “If you would only spare my life, I would be sure</p>\n<p>to repay your kindness.” The Lion laughed and let him go.</p>\n<p>It happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who</p>\n<p>bound him by strong ropes to the ground.</p>\n<p>The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and</p>\n",
        "<p>set him free, exclaiming:</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wolf And The Lamb</h3>\n<p>WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay violent</p>\n<p>hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the Wolf’s right to</p>\n<p>eat him.</p>\n<p>He thus addressed him: “Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me.” “Indeed,”</p>\n<p>bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, “I was not then born.” Then said</p>\n<p>the Wolf, “You feed in my pasture.” “No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have</p>\n<p>not yet tasted grass.” Again said the Wolf, “You drink of my well.” “No,”</p>\n",
        "<p>exclaimed the Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is</p>\n<p>both food and drink to me.” Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up,</p>\n<p>saying, “Well!</p>\n<p>I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.”</p>\n<p>The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Ass And The Grasshopper</h3>\n<p>AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; and,</p>\n<p>desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort of food they</p>\n<p>lived on to give them such beautiful voices.</p>\n<p>They replied, “The dew.” The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and</p>\n<p>in a short time died of hunger.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wolf and the Crane</h3>\n<p>A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large sum, to</p>\n<p>put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone.</p>\n<p>When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the</p>\n<p>Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: “Why, you have surely already</p>\n<p>had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in</p>\n<p>safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Father And His Sons</h3>\n<p>A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among themselves.</p>\n<p>When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to</p>\n<p>give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and for this</p>\n<p>purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks.</p>\n<p>When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in</p>\n<p>succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces.</p>\n<p>They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it.</p>\n",
        "<p>He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again</p>\n<p>put them into his sons’ hands, upon which they broke them easily.</p>\n<p>He then addressed them in these words: “My sons, if you are of one mind, and</p>\n<p>unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the</p>\n<p>attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be</p>\n<p>broken as easily as these sticks.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Bat And The Weasels</h3>\n<p>A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be spared</p>\n<p>his life.</p>\n<p>The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds.</p>\n<p>The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another</p>\n<p>Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him.</p>\n<p>The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time</p>\n<p>escaped.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Cock and the Jewel</h3>\n<p>A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious stone</p>\n<p>and exclaimed: “If your owner had found thee, and not I, he would have taken</p>\n<p>thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have found thee for no</p>\n<p>purpose.</p>\n<p>I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Swallow and the Crow</h3>\n<p>THE SWALLOW and the Crow had a contention about their plumage.</p>\n<p>The Crow put an end to the dispute by saying, “Your feathers are all very well</p>\n<p>in the spring, but mine protect me against the winter.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Kingdom of the Lion</h3>\n<p>THE BEASTS of the field and forest had a Lion as their king.</p>\n<p>He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king</p>\n<p>could be.</p>\n<p>During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the</p>\n<p>birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the</p>\n<p>Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and</p>\n<p>the Hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Hare said, “Oh, how I have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall</p>\n<p>take their place with impunity by the side of the strong.” And after the Hare</p>\n<p>said this, he ran for his life.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Traveler and His Dog</h3>\n<p>A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door</p>\n<p>stretching himself.</p>\n<p>He asked him sharply: “Why do you stand there gaping?</p>\n<p>Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.” The Dog, wagging his</p>\n<p>tail, replied: “O, master!</p>\n<p>I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Ants and the Grasshopper</h3>\n<p>THE ANTS were spending a fine winter’s day drying grain collected in the</p>\n<p>summertime.</p>\n<p>A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a</p>\n<p>little food.</p>\n<p>The Ants inquired of him, “Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?”</p>\n<p>He replied, “I had not leisure enough.</p>\n<p>I passed the days in singing.” They then said in derision: “If you were foolish</p>\n",
        "<p>enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Hare and the Tortoise</h3>\n<p>A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, who</p>\n<p>replied, laughing: “Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a</p>\n<p>race.” The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to</p>\n<p>the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the</p>\n<p>goal.</p>\n<p>On the day appointed for the race the two started together.</p>\n<p>The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady</p>\n",
        "<p>pace straight to the end of the course.</p>\n<p>The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had</p>\n<p>reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Charcoal-Burner And The Fuller</h3>\n<p>A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house.</p>\n<p>One day he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him,</p>\n<p>saying that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping</p>\n<p>expenses would be lessened.</p>\n<p>The Fuller replied, “The arrangement is impossible as far as I am concerned,</p>\n<p>for whatever I should whiten, you would immediately blacken again with your</p>\n<p>charcoal.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Boy Hunting Locusts</h3>\n<p>A BOY was hunting for locusts.</p>\n<p>He had caught a goodly number, when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a</p>\n<p>locust, reached out his hand to take him.</p>\n<p>The Scorpion, showing his sting, said: “If you had but touched me, my friend,</p>\n<p>you would have lost me, and all your locusts too!”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fisherman Piping</h3>\n<p>A FISHERMAN skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore.</p>\n<p>Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the hope that the</p>\n<p>fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord dance into his net,</p>\n<p>which he had placed below.</p>\n<p>At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his</p>\n<p>net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish.</p>\n<p>When he saw them leaping about in the net upon the rock he said: “O you most</p>\n",
        "<p>perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance, but now that I have</p>\n<p>ceased you do so merrily.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Dog and the Shadow</h3>\n<p>A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his mouth, saw</p>\n<p>his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another Dog, with a piece</p>\n<p>of meat double his own in size.</p>\n<p>He immediately let go of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get</p>\n<p>his larger piece from him.</p>\n<p>He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water, because it was a</p>\n<p>shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.</p>\n",
        "<h3>Hercules and the Wagoner</h3>\n<p>A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank down</p>\n<p>deep into a rut.</p>\n<p>The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood looking at the wagon, and did</p>\n<p>nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules to come and help him.</p>\n<p>Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed him: “Put your shoulders to</p>\n<p>the wheels, my man.</p>\n<p>Goad on your bullocks, and never more pray to me for help, until you have done</p>\n",
        "<p>your best to help yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Mole and His Mother</h3>\n<p>A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: “I am sure than I</p>\n<p>can see, Mother!” In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his Mother placed</p>\n<p>before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, “What is it?” The young</p>\n<p>Mole said, “It is a pebble.” His Mother exclaimed: “My son, I am afraid that</p>\n<p>you are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Herdsman and the Lost Bull</h3>\n<p>A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold.</p>\n<p>After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only</p>\n<p>discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in sacrifice</p>\n<p>to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest.</p>\n<p>Not long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion</p>\n<p>feeding on the Calf.</p>\n<p>Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven, and said:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the Guardian Deities of the forest if I</p>\n<p>could only find out who had robbed me; but now that I have discovered the</p>\n<p>thief, I would willingly add a full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I</p>\n<p>may only secure my own escape from him in safety.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fawn and His Mother</h3>\n<p>A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, “You are larger than a dog, and swifter,</p>\n<p>and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense; why, then, O</p>\n<p>Mother!</p>\n<p>do the hounds frighten you so?” She smiled, and said: “I know full well, my</p>\n<p>son, that all you say is true.</p>\n<p>I have the advantages you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a single</p>\n<p>dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion</h3>\n<p>THE ASS and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for their mutual</p>\n<p>protection, went out into the forest to hunt.</p>\n<p>They had not proceeded far when they met a Lion.</p>\n<p>The Fox, seeing imminent danger, approached the Lion and promised to contrive</p>\n<p>for him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not to harm</p>\n<p>the Fox.</p>\n<p>Then, upon assuring the Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a</p>\n",
        "<p>deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it.</p>\n<p>The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and</p>\n<p>attacked the Ass at his leisure.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Flies and the Honey-Pot</h3>\n<p>A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in</p>\n<p>a housekeeper’s room, and placing their feet in it, ate greedily.</p>\n<p>Their feet, however, became so smeared with the honey that they could not use</p>\n<p>their wings, nor release themselves, and were suffocated.</p>\n<p>Just as they were expiring, they exclaimed, “O foolish creatures that we are,</p>\n<p>for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lioness</h3>\n<p>A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the</p>\n<p>animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at</p>\n<p>a birth.</p>\n<p>They rushed clamorously into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her</p>\n<p>the settlement of the dispute.</p>\n<p>“And you,” they said, “how many sons have you at a birth?” The Lioness laughed</p>\n<p>at them, and said: “Why!</p>\n",
        "<p>I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred Lion.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Farmer and the Snake</h3>\n<p>ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold.</p>\n<p>He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom.</p>\n<p>The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural</p>\n<p>instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” cried the Farmer with his last breath, “I am rightly served for pitying a</p>\n<p>scoundrel.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Man and the Lion</h3>\n<p>A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest.</p>\n<p>They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in</p>\n<p>strength and prowess.</p>\n<p>As they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone, which represented</p>\n<p>“a Lion strangled by a Man.” The traveler pointed to it and said: “See there!</p>\n<p>How strong we are, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts.” The Lion</p>\n<p>replied: “This statue was made by one of you men.</p>\n",
        "<p>If we Lions knew how to erect statues, you would see the Man placed under the</p>\n<p>paw of the Lion.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble</h3>\n<p>THE POMEGRANATE and Apple-Tree disputed as to which was the most beautiful.</p>\n<p>When their strife was at its height, a Bramble from the neighboring hedge</p>\n<p>lifted up its voice, and said in a boastful tone: “Pray, my dear friends, in my</p>\n<p>presence at least cease from such vain disputings.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Farmer and the Stork</h3>\n<p>A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number of Cranes,</p>\n<p>which came to pick up his seed.</p>\n<p>With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was</p>\n<p>earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life.</p>\n<p>“Pray save me, Master,” he said, “and let me go free this once.</p>\n<p>My broken limb should excite your pity.</p>\n<p>Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see</p>\n",
        "<p>how I love and slave for my father and mother.</p>\n<p>Look too, at my feathers—they are not the least like those of a Crane.” The</p>\n<p>Farmer laughed aloud and said, “It may be all as you say, I only know this: I</p>\n<p>have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their</p>\n<p>company.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Mountain in Labor</h3>\n<p>A MOUNTAIN was once greatly agitated.</p>\n<p>Loud groans and noises were heard, and crowds of people came from all parts to</p>\n<p>see what was the matter.</p>\n<p>While they were assembled in anxious expectation of some terrible calamity, out</p>\n<p>came a Mouse.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Bear and the Fox</h3>\n<p>A BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all animals he was</p>\n<p>the most tender in his regard for man, for he had such respect for him that he</p>\n<p>would not even touch his dead body.</p>\n<p>A Fox hearing these words said with a smile to the Bear, “Oh!</p>\n<p>that you would eat the dead and not the living.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Tortoise and the Eagle</h3>\n<p>A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of her hard</p>\n<p>fate, that no one would teach her to fly.</p>\n<p>An Eagle, hovering near, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she</p>\n<p>would give him if he would take her aloft and float her in the air.</p>\n<p>“I will give you,” she said, “all the riches of the Red Sea.” “I will teach you</p>\n<p>to fly then,” said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her</p>\n<p>almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty mountain,</p>\n",
        "<p>dashing her shell to pieces.</p>\n<p>The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death: “I have deserved my present</p>\n<p>fate; for what had I to do with wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move</p>\n<p>about on the earth?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fox and the Goat</h3>\n<p>A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.</p>\n<p>A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox,</p>\n<p>inquired if the water was good.</p>\n<p>Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish</p>\n<p>praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging</p>\n<p>him to descend.</p>\n<p>The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he</p>\n",
        "<p>drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a</p>\n<p>scheme for their common escape.</p>\n<p>“If,” said he, “you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head,</p>\n<p>I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat</p>\n<p>readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back.</p>\n<p>Steadying himself with the Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the</p>\n<p>well and made off as fast as he could.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and</p>\n<p>cried out, “You foolish old fellow!</p>\n<p>If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you</p>\n<p>would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have</p>\n<p>exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Raven and the Swan</h3>\n<p>A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful plumage.</p>\n<p>Supposing that the Swan’s splendid white color arose from his washing in the</p>\n<p>water in which he swam, the Raven left the altars in the neighborhood where he</p>\n<p>picked up his living, and took up residence in the lakes and pools.</p>\n<p>But cleansing his feathers as often as he would, he could not change their</p>\n<p>color, while through want of food he perished.</p>\n",

        "<h3>The Dog in the Manger</h3>\n<p>A DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented the oxen from</p>\n<p>eating the hay which had been placed for them.</p>\n<p>“What a selfish Dog!” said one of them to his companions; “he cannot eat the</p>\n<p>hay himself, and yet refuses to allow those to eat who can.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Oxen and the Axle-Trees</h3>\n<p>A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen.</p>\n<p>The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, turning round,</p>\n<p>thus addressed the wheels: “Hullo there!</p>\n<p>why do you make so much noise?</p>\n<p>We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Farmer and the Cranes</h3>\n<p>SOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with wheat.</p>\n<p>For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased them away by the</p>\n<p>terror he inspired; but when the birds found that the sling was only swung in</p>\n<p>the air, they ceased to take any notice of it and would not move.</p>\n<p>The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling with stones, and killed a great</p>\n<p>number.</p>\n<p>The remaining birds at once forsook his fields, crying to each other, “It is</p>\n",
        "<p>time for us to be off to Liliput: for this man is no longer content to scare</p>\n<p>us, but begins to show us in earnest what he can do.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Sick Lion</h3>\n<p>A LION, unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food by</p>\n<p>force, resolved to do so by artifice.</p>\n<p>He returned to his den, and lying down there, pretended to be sick, taking care</p>\n<p>that his sickness should be publicly known.</p>\n<p>The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the</p>\n<p>Lion devoured them.</p>\n<p>After many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the Fox discovered the trick and</p>\n",
        "<p>presenting himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave, at a</p>\n<p>respectful distance, and asked him how he was.</p>\n<p>“I am very middling,” replied the Lion, “but why do you stand without?</p>\n<p>Pray enter within to talk with me.” “No, thank you,” said the Fox.</p>\n<p>“I notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no</p>\n<p>trace of any returning.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Bear and the Two Travelers</h3>\n<p>TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their path.</p>\n<p>One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the</p>\n<p>branches.</p>\n<p>The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when</p>\n<p>the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held</p>\n<p>his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could.</p>\n<p>The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and</p>\n<p>jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear.</p>\n<p>“He gave me this advice,” his companion replied.</p>\n<p>“Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail</h3>\n<p>A FOX caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he</p>\n<p>was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that being tailless was</p>\n<p>much more attractive, thus making up for his own deprivation.</p>\n<p>He assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their</p>\n<p>tails, saying that they would not only look much better without them, but that</p>\n<p>they would get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great</p>\n",
        "<p>inconvenience.</p>\n<p>One of them interrupting him said, “If you had not yourself lost your tail, my</p>\n<p>friend, you would not thus counsel us.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Cat and the Cock</h3>\n<p>A CAT caught a Cock, and pondered how he might find a reasonable excuse for</p>\n<p>eating him.</p>\n<p>He accused him of being a nuisance to men by crowing in the nighttime and not</p>\n<p>permitting them to sleep.</p>\n<p>The Cock defended himself by saying that he did this for the benefit of men,</p>\n<p>that they might rise in time for their labours.</p>\n<p>The Cat replied, “Although you abound in specious apologies, I shall not remain</p>\n",
        "<p>supperless;” and he made a meal of him.</p>\n",

        "<p>next day, mistakenly caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and killed him</p>\n<p>instantly.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Goat and the Goatherd</h3>\n<p>A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock.</p>\n<p>He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention to</p>\n<p>the summons.</p>\n<p>At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not</p>\n<p>to tell his master.</p>\n<p>The Goat replied, “Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak though I be</p>\n<p>silent.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Boasting Traveler</h3>\n<p>A MAN who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on returning to his</p>\n<p>own country, of the many wonderful and heroic feats he had performed in the</p>\n<p>different places he had visited.</p>\n<p>Among other things, he said that when he was at Rhodes he had leaped to such a</p>\n<p>distance that no man of his day could leap anywhere near him as to that, there</p>\n<p>were in Rhodes many persons who saw him do it and whom he could call as</p>\n<p>witnesses.</p>\n",
        "<p>One of the bystanders interrupted him, saying: “Now, my good man, if this be</p>\n<p>all true there is no need of witnesses.</p>\n<p>Suppose this to be Rhodes, and leap for us.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion in Love</h3>\n<p>A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage.</p>\n<p>The Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon</p>\n<p>this expedient to rid himself of his importunities.</p>\n<p>He expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter</p>\n<p>on one condition: that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off</p>\n<p>his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both.</p>\n<p>The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal.</p>\n",
        "<p>But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his request, the</p>\n<p>Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his club, and drove him away into</p>\n<p>the forest.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Miser</h3>\n<p>A MISER sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried in a</p>\n<p>hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily.</p>\n<p>One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to</p>\n<p>watch his movements.</p>\n<p>He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to</p>\n<p>the lump of gold, and stole it.</p>\n<p>The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair</p>\n",
        "<p>and to make loud lamentations.</p>\n<p>A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, “Pray</p>\n<p>do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy</p>\n<p>that the gold is still lying there.</p>\n<p>It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it</p>\n<p>not, as you did not make the slightest use of it.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Porker, the Sheep, and the Goat</h3>\n<p>A young Pig was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a Sheep.</p>\n<p>On one occasion the shepherd laid hold of him, when he grunted, and squeaked,</p>\n<p>and resisted violently.</p>\n<p>The Sheep and the Goat complained of his distressing cries, and said, “He often</p>\n<p>handles us, and we do not cry out.” To this he replied, “Your handling and mine</p>\n<p>are very different things.</p>\n<p>He catches you only for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my</p>\n",

        "<h3>The Frogs Asking for a King</h3>\n<p>THE FROGS, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors to Jupiter</p>\n<p>entreating for a King.</p>\n<p>Perceiving their simplicity, he cast down a huge log into the lake.</p>\n<p>The Frogs were terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall and hid</p>\n<p>themselves in the depths of the pool.</p>\n<p>But as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam again</p>\n<p>to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting</p>\n",
        "<p>on it in contempt.</p>\n<p>After some time they began to think themselves ill-treated in the appointment</p>\n<p>of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he</p>\n<p>would set over them another sovereign.</p>\n<p>He then gave them an Eel to govern them.</p>\n<p>When the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time to</p>\n<p>Jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another King.</p>\n",

        "<p>The Snake, slightly hissing, said: “There can henceforth be no peace between</p>\n<p>us; for whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever</p>\n<p>you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox</h3>\n<p>A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer’s day, fell fast asleep in his den.</p>\n<p>A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers.</p>\n<p>He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched every corner of his</p>\n<p>den to find the Mouse.</p>\n<p>A Fox seeing him said: “A fine Lion you are, to be frightened of a Mouse.”</p>\n<p>“’Tis not the Mouse I fear,” said the Lion; “I resent his familiarity and</p>\n<p>ill-breeding.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Horse and Groom</h3>\n<p>A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his Horse,</p>\n<p>but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit.</p>\n<p>“Alas!” said the Horse, “if you really wish me to be in good condition, you</p>\n<p>should groom me less, and feed me more.”</p>\n",

        "<p>carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm.</p>\n<p>He often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and</p>\n<p>idleness of the Lapdog, till at last one day he broke his cords and halter, and</p>\n<p>galloped into his master’s house, kicking up his heels without measure, and</p>\n<p>frisking and fawning as well as he could.</p>\n<p>He next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he</p>\n<p>broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms.</p>\n",
        "<p>He then attempted to lick his master, and jumped upon his back.</p>\n<p>The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their</p>\n<p>master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Ass to his stable with kicks</p>\n<p>and clubs and cuffs.</p>\n<p>The Ass, as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: “I</p>\n<p>have brought it all on myself!</p>\n<p>Why could I not have been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish</p>\n",

        "<p>If we get rid of them, we shall fall into the hands of unskillful operators,</p>\n<p>and thus suffer a double death: for you may be assured, that though all the</p>\n<p>Butchers should perish, yet will men never want beef.”</p>\n",

        "<h3>The Astronomer</h3>\n<p>AN ASTRONOMER used to go out at night to observe the stars.</p>\n<p>One evening, as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention fixed</p>\n<p>on the sky, he fell accidentally into a deep well.</p>\n<p>While he lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises, and cried loudly for</p>\n<p>help, a neighbor ran to the well, and learning what had happened said: “Hark</p>\n<p>ye, old fellow, why, in striving to pry into what is in heaven, do you not</p>\n<p>manage to see what is on earth?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wolves and the Sheep</h3>\n<p>“WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between us?” said the</p>\n<p>Wolves to the Sheep.</p>\n<p>“Those evil-disposed Dogs have much to answer for.</p>\n<p>They always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before we have done any</p>\n<p>harm.</p>\n<p>If you would only dismiss them from your heels, there might soon be treaties of</p>\n<p>peace and reconciliation between us.” The Sheep, poor silly creatures, were</p>\n",

        "<p>When the appointed day arrived, and the birds had assembled before Jupiter, the</p>\n<p>Jackdaw also made his appearance in his many feathered finery.</p>\n<p>But when Jupiter proposed to make him king because of the beauty of his</p>\n<p>plumage, the birds indignantly protested, and each plucked from him his own</p>\n<p>feathers, leaving the Jackdaw nothing but a Jackdaw.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Kid and the Wolf</h3>\n<p>A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm’s way, saw a Wolf passing by</p>\n<p>and immediately began to taunt and revile him.</p>\n<p>The Wolf, looking up, said, “Sirrah!</p>\n<p>I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art</p>\n<p>standing.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Old Woman and the Physician</h3>\n<p>AN OLD WOMAN having lost the use of her eyes, called in a Physician to heal</p>\n<p>them, and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses: that if he</p>\n<p>should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum of money; but if</p>\n<p>her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing.</p>\n<p>This agreement being made, the Physician, time after time, applied his salve to</p>\n<p>her eyes, and on every visit took something away, stealing all her property</p>\n<p>little by little.</p>\n",

        "<p>truth in what he says; for I did promise to give him a sum of money if I should</p>\n<p>recover my sight: but if I continued blind, I was to give him nothing.</p>\n<p>Now he declares that I am healed.</p>\n<p>I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind; for when I lost the use of my</p>\n<p>eyes, I saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods: but now, though he</p>\n<p>swears I am cured of my blindness, I am not able to see a single thing in it.”</p>\n",

        "<p>“Cease, Mother, to puff yourself out,” said her son, “and do not be angry; for</p>\n<p>you would, I assure you, sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness of</p>\n<p>that monster.”</p>\n",

        "<h3>The Heifer and the Ox</h3>\n<p>A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and tormented him with</p>\n<p>reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival, the owner released the Ox from his</p>\n<p>yoke, but bound the Heifer with cords and led him away to the altar to be slain</p>\n<p>in honour of the occasion.</p>\n<p>The Ox saw what was being done, and said with a smile to the Heifer: “For this</p>\n<p>you were allowed to live in idleness, because you were presently to be</p>\n",
        "<p>sacrificed.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle</h3>\n<p>TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard.</p>\n<p>One at last put the other to flight.</p>\n<p>The vanquished Cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner, while the</p>\n<p>conqueror, flying up to a high wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly</p>\n<p>with all his might.</p>\n<p>An Eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off in his</p>\n<p>talons.</p>\n",
        "<p>The vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled henceforth</p>\n<p>with undisputed mastery.</p>\n",

        "<h3>The Belly and the Members</h3>\n<p>THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, “Why should we be</p>\n<p>perpetually engaged in administering to your wants, while you do nothing but</p>\n<p>take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?” The Members</p>\n<p>carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly.</p>\n<p>The whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and</p>\n<p>eyes, when too late, repented of their folly.</p>\n",

        "<p>examined everything in turn, he spied the tips of the antlers of the Stag</p>\n<p>peeping out of the straw.</p>\n<p>Then summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be seized and</p>\n<p>killed.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Two Dogs</h3>\n<p>A MAN had two dogs: a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports, and a</p>\n<p>Housedog, taught to watch the house.</p>\n<p>When he returned home after a good day’s sport, he always gave the Housedog a</p>\n<p>large share of his spoil.</p>\n<p>The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at this, reproached his companion, saying,</p>\n<p>“It is very hard to have all this labor, while you, who do not assist in the</p>\n<p>chase, luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions.” The Housedog replied, “Do not</p>\n",
        "<p>blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master, who has not taught me to</p>\n<p>labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor of others.”</p>\n",

        "<p>“I will take the first share,” he said, “because I am King: and the second</p>\n<p>share, as a partner with you in the chase: and the third share (believe me)</p>\n<p>will be a source of great evil to you, unless you willingly resign it to me,</p>\n<p>and set off as fast as you can.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion and the Dolphin</h3>\n<p>A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of the waves,</p>\n<p>and suggested that they contract an alliance, saying that of all the animals</p>\n<p>they ought to be the best friends, since the one was the king of beasts on the</p>\n<p>earth, and the other was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the</p>\n<p>ocean.</p>\n<p>The Dolphin gladly consented to this request.</p>\n<p>Not long afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the</p>\n",
        "<p>Dolphin to help him.</p>\n<p>The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him assistance, was unable to do so,</p>\n<p>as he could not by any means reach the land.</p>\n<p>The Lion abused him as a traitor.</p>\n<p>The Dolphin replied, “Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while</p>\n<p>giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living</p>\n<p>upon the land.”</p>\n",

        "<h3>The Rivers and the Sea</h3>\n<p>THE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, “Why is it that when</p>\n<p>we flow into your tides so potable and sweet, you work in us such a change, and</p>\n<p>make us salty and unfit to drink?” The Sea, perceiving that they intended to</p>\n<p>throw the blame on him, said, “Pray cease to flow into me, and then you will</p>\n<p>not be made briny.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wild Boar and the Fox</h3>\n<p>A WILD BOAR stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the trunk.</p>\n<p>A Fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his teeth when there was no</p>\n<p>danger threatening from either huntsman or hound.</p>\n<p>He replied, “I do it advisedly; for it would never do to have to sharpen my</p>\n<p>weapons just at the time I ought to be using them.”</p>\n",

        "<p>because of his promise.</p>\n<p>He thus answered the Bee: “You shall have your request, but it will be at the</p>\n<p>peril of your own life.</p>\n<p>For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make, and then you</p>\n<p>will die from the loss of it.”</p>\n",

        "<h3>The Swan and the Goose</h3>\n<p>A CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan.</p>\n<p>He fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its song.</p>\n<p>When the time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to get him at night,</p>\n<p>when it was dark, and he was not able to distinguish one bird from the other.</p>\n<p>By mistake he caught the Swan instead of the Goose.</p>\n<p>The Swan, threatened with death, burst forth into song and thus made himself</p>\n<p>known by his voice, and preserved his life by his melody.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Doe and the Lion</h3>\n<p>A DOE hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging to a Lion.</p>\n<p>The Lion concealed himself on seeing her approach, but when she was safe within</p>\n<p>the cave, sprang upon her and tore her to pieces.</p>\n<p>“Woe is me,” exclaimed the Doe, “who have escaped from man, only to throw</p>\n<p>myself into the mouth of a wild beast?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fisherman and the Little Fish</h3>\n<p>A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a single small</p>\n<p>Fish as the result of his day’s labor.</p>\n<p>The Fish, panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life: “O Sir, what good</p>\n<p>can I be to you, and how little am I worth?</p>\n<p>I am not yet come to my full size.</p>\n<p>Pray spare my life, and put me back into the sea.</p>\n<p>I shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of the rich, and then you</p>\n",
        "<p>can catch me again, and make a handsome profit of me.” The Fisherman replied,</p>\n<p>“I should indeed be a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater</p>\n<p>uncertain profit, I were to forego my present certain gain.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Hunter and the Woodman</h3>\n<p>A HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion.</p>\n<p>He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his</p>\n<p>footsteps or knew where his lair was.</p>\n<p>“I will,” said the man, “at once show you the Lion himself.” The Hunter,</p>\n<p>turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from fear, replied, “No, thank</p>\n<p>you.</p>\n<p>I did not ask that; it is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion</p>\n",
        "<p>himself.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Swollen Fox</h3>\n<p>A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds in the hollow</p>\n<p>of an oak, crept into the hole and made a hearty meal.</p>\n<p>When he finished, he was so full that he was not able to get out, and began to</p>\n<p>groan and lament his fate.</p>\n<p>Another Fox passing by heard his cries, and coming up, inquired the cause of</p>\n<p>his complaining.</p>\n<p>On learning what had happened, he said to him, “Ah, you will have to remain</p>\n",
        "<p>there, my friend, until you become such as you were when you crept in, and then</p>\n<p>you will easily get out.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Two Frogs</h3>\n<p>TWO FROGS dwelt in the same pool.</p>\n<p>When the pool dried up under the summer’s heat, they left it and set out</p>\n<p>together for another home.</p>\n<p>As they went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply supplied with water,</p>\n<p>and when they saw it, one of the Frogs said to the other, “Let us descend and</p>\n<p>make our abode in this well: it will furnish us with shelter and food.” The</p>\n<p>other replied with greater caution, “But suppose the water should fail us.</p>\n",
        "<p>How can we get out again from so great a depth?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lamp</h3>\n<p>A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted that it gave</p>\n<p>more light than the sun.</p>\n<p>Then a sudden puff of wind arose, and the Lamp was immediately extinguished.</p>\n<p>Its owner lit it again, and said: “Boast no more, but henceforth be content to</p>\n<p>give thy light in silence.</p>\n<p>Know that not even the stars need to be relit.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Camel and the Arab</h3>\n<p>AN ARAB Camel-driver, after completing the loading of his Camel, asked him</p>\n<p>which he would like best, to go up hill or down.</p>\n<p>The poor beast replied, not without a touch of reason: “Why do you ask me?</p>\n<p>Is it that the level way through the desert is closed?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass</h3>\n<p>A MILLER and his son were driving their Ass to a neighboring fair to sell him.</p>\n<p>They had not gone far when they met with a troop of women collected round a</p>\n<p>well, talking and laughing.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” cried one of them, “did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging</p>\n<p>along the road on foot when they might ride?” The old man hearing this, quickly</p>\n<p>made his son mount the Ass, and continued to walk along merrily by his side.</p>\n<p>Presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate.</p>\n",
        "<p>“There,” said one of them, “it proves what I was a-saying.</p>\n<p>What respect is shown to old age in these days?</p>\n<p>Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk?</p>\n<p>Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man rest his weary limbs.” Upon</p>\n<p>this the old man made his son dismount, and got up himself.</p>\n<p>In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and</p>\n<p>children: “Why, you lazy old fellow,” cried several tongues at once, “how can</p>\n",
        "<p>you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace</p>\n<p>by the side of you?” The good-natured Miller immediately took up his son behind</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>They had now almost reached the town.</p>\n<p>“Pray, honest friend,” said a citizen, “is that Ass your own?” “Yes,” replied</p>\n<p>the old man.</p>\n<p>“O, one would not have thought so,” said the other, “by the way you load him.</p>\n",
        "<p>Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you.”</p>\n<p>“Anything to please you,” said the old man; “we can but try.” So, alighting</p>\n<p>with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass together and with the help of a</p>\n<p>pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance</p>\n<p>to the town.</p>\n<p>This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the</p>\n<p>Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to,</p>\n",
        "<p>broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river.</p>\n<p>Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again,</p>\n<p>convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and</p>\n<p>lost his Ass in the bargain.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Cat and the Mice</h3>\n<p>A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice.</p>\n<p>A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them</p>\n<p>one by one.</p>\n<p>Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.</p>\n<p>The Cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt</p>\n<p>them forth by some device.</p>\n<p>For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it,</p>\n",
        "<p>pretended to be dead.</p>\n<p>One of the Mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and said, “Ah, my good madam,</p>\n<p>even though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Mouse and the Bull</h3>\n<p>A BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried to capture him.</p>\n<p>But the Mouse reached his hole in safety.</p>\n<p>Though the Bull dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he could</p>\n<p>rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep outside the hole.</p>\n<p>The Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his flank, and again biting him,</p>\n<p>retreated to his hole.</p>\n<p>The Bull rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed.</p>\n",
        "<p>At which the Mouse said, “The great do not always prevail.</p>\n<p>There are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do mischief.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Dog and the Cook</h3>\n<p>A RICH MAN gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends and</p>\n<p>acquaintances.</p>\n<p>His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of</p>\n<p>his, saying, “My master gives a feast, and there is always much food remaining;</p>\n<p>come and sup with me tonight.” The Dog thus invited went at the hour appointed,</p>\n<p>and seeing the preparations for so grand an entertainment, said in the joy of</p>\n<p>his heart, “How glad I am that I came!</p>\n",
        "<p>I do not often get such a chance as this.</p>\n<p>I will take care and eat enough to last me both today and tomorrow.” While he</p>\n<p>was congratulating himself and wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to his</p>\n<p>friend, the Cook saw him moving about among his dishes and, seizing him by his</p>\n<p>fore and hind paws, bundled him without ceremony out of the window.</p>\n<p>He fell with force upon the ground and limped away, howling dreadfully.</p>\n<p>His yelling soon attracted other street dogs, who came up to him and inquired</p>\n",
        "<p>how he had enjoyed his supper.</p>\n<p>He replied, “Why, to tell you the truth, I drank so much wine that I remember</p>\n<p>nothing.</p>\n<p>I do not know how I got out of the house.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Thieves and the Cock</h3>\n<p>SOME THIEVES broke into a house and found nothing but a Cock, whom they stole,</p>\n<p>and got off as fast as they could.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving at home they prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his</p>\n<p>life: “Pray spare me; I am very serviceable to men.</p>\n<p>I wake them up in the night to their work.” “That is the very reason why we</p>\n<p>must the more kill you,” they replied; “for when you wake your neighbors, you</p>\n<p>entirely put an end to our business.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Dancing Monkeys</h3>\n<p>A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance.</p>\n<p>Being naturally great mimics of men’s actions, they showed themselves most apt</p>\n<p>pupils, and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well</p>\n<p>as any of the courtiers.</p>\n<p>The spectacle was often repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a</p>\n<p>courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts and threw</p>\n<p>them upon the stage.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed</p>\n<p>they were) Monkeys instead of actors.</p>\n<p>Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes, they fought with one another</p>\n<p>for the nuts.</p>\n<p>The dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of</p>\n<p>the audience.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Farmer and the Fox</h3>\n<p>A FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his poultry yard, caught</p>\n<p>him at last, and being determined to take an ample revenge, tied some rope well</p>\n<p>soaked in oil to his tail, and set it on fire.</p>\n<p>The Fox by a strange fatality rushed to the fields of the Farmer who had</p>\n<p>captured him.</p>\n<p>It was the time of the wheat harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing that year</p>\n<p>and returned home grieving sorely.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Traveler and Fortune</h3>\n<p>A TRAVELER wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with fatigue, on the</p>\n<p>very brink of a deep well.</p>\n<p>Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared</p>\n<p>to him and waking him from his slumber thus addressed him: “Good Sir, pray wake</p>\n<p>up: for if you fall into the well, the blame will be thrown on me, and I shall</p>\n<p>get an ill name among mortals; for I find that men are sure to impute their</p>\n<p>calamities to me, however much by their own folly they have really brought them</p>\n",
        "<p>on themselves.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Seagull and the Kite</h3>\n<p>A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and</p>\n<p>lay down on the shore to die.</p>\n<p>A Kite saw him and exclaimed: “You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the</p>\n<p>air has no business to seek its food from the sea.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox</h3>\n<p>A LION and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought fiercely for its</p>\n<p>possession.</p>\n<p>When they had fearfully lacerated each other and were faint from the long</p>\n<p>combat, they lay down exhausted with fatigue.</p>\n<p>A Fox, who had gone round them at a distance several times, saw them both</p>\n<p>stretched on the ground with the Kid lying untouched in the middle.</p>\n<p>He ran in between them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said, “Woe be to</p>\n<p>us, that we should have fought and belabored ourselves only to serve the turn</p>\n<p>of a Fox.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury</h3>\n<p>A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel, of which the</p>\n<p>crew and passengers were all drowned.</p>\n<p>He inveighed against the injustice of Providence, which would for the sake of</p>\n<p>one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent persons to</p>\n<p>perish.</p>\n<p>As he was indulging in these reflections, he found himself surrounded by a</p>\n<p>whole army of Ants, near whose nest he was standing.</p>\n",
        "<p>One of them climbed up and stung him, and he immediately trampled them all to</p>\n<p>death with his foot.</p>\n<p>Mercury presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with his wand, said,</p>\n<p>“And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of the dealings of Providence, who</p>\n<p>hast thyself in a similar manner treated these poor Ants?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Peasant and the Eagle</h3>\n<p>A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring the bird, set</p>\n<p>him free.</p>\n<p>The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to his deliverer, for seeing the Peasant</p>\n<p>sitting under a wall which was not safe, he flew toward him and with his talons</p>\n<p>snatched a bundle from his head.</p>\n<p>When the Peasant rose in pursuit, the Eagle let the bundle fall again.</p>\n<p>Taking it up, the man returned to the same place, to find that the wall under</p>\n",
        "<p>which he had been sitting had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service</p>\n<p>rendered him by the Eagle.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fox and the Leopard</h3>\n<p>THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of the two.</p>\n<p>The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots which decorated his skin.</p>\n<p>But the Fox, interrupting him, said, “And how much more beautiful than you am</p>\n<p>I, who am decorated, not in body, but in mind.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion and the Hare</h3>\n<p>A LION came across a Hare, who was fast asleep.</p>\n<p>He was just in the act of seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and</p>\n<p>he left the Hare to follow him.</p>\n<p>The Hare, scared by the noise, awoke and scudded away.</p>\n<p>The Lion was unable after a long chase to catch the Hart, and returned to feed</p>\n<p>upon the Hare.</p>\n<p>On finding that the Hare also had run off, he said, “I am rightly served, for</p>\n",
        "<p>having let go of the food that I had in my hand for the chance of obtaining</p>\n<p>more.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter</h3>\n<p>A VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of Mercury, before</p>\n<p>which he made offerings day by day, and begged the idol to make him rich, but</p>\n<p>in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer.</p>\n<p>At last, being very angry, he took his image down from its pedestal and dashed</p>\n<p>it against the wall.</p>\n<p>When its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which the Carpenter</p>\n<p>quickly picked up and said, “Well, I think thou art altogether contradictory</p>\n",
        "<p>and unreasonable; for when I paid you honour, I reaped no benefits: but now</p>\n<p>that I maltreat you I am loaded with an abundance of riches.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass</h3>\n<p>THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each other in</p>\n<p>the chase.</p>\n<p>Having secured a large booty, the Lion on their return from the forest asked</p>\n<p>the Ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty.</p>\n<p>The Ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly</p>\n<p>requested the two others to make the first choice.</p>\n<p>The Lion, bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he requested the Fox to do him the favour to make a division.</p>\n<p>The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to</p>\n<p>himself the smallest possible morsel.</p>\n<p>The Lion said, “Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of</p>\n<p>division?</p>\n<p>You are perfect to a fraction.” He replied, “I learned it from the Ass, by</p>\n<p>witnessing his fate.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Bull and the Goat</h3>\n<p>A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds had recently</p>\n<p>occupied.</p>\n<p>As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in the cave sharply attacked him with his</p>\n<p>horns.</p>\n<p>The Bull quietly addressed him: “Butt away as much as you will.</p>\n<p>I have no fear of you, but of the Lion.</p>\n<p>Let that monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the respective</p>\n",
        "<p>strength of a Goat and a Bull.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Bald Knight</h3>\n<p>A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt.</p>\n<p>A sudden puff of wind blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang</p>\n<p>forth from his companions.</p>\n<p>He pulled up his horse, and with great glee joined in the joke by saying, “What</p>\n<p>a marvel it is that hairs which are not mine should fly from me, when they have</p>\n<p>forsaken even the man on whose head they grew.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Oaks and Jupiter</h3>\n<p>THE OAKS presented a complaint to Jupiter, saying, “We bear for no purpose the</p>\n<p>burden of life, as of all the trees that grow we are the most continually in</p>\n<p>peril of the axe.” Jupiter made answer: “You have only to thank yourselves for</p>\n<p>the misfortunes to which you are exposed: for if you did not make such</p>\n<p>excellent pillars and posts, and prove yourselves so serviceable to the</p>\n<p>carpenters and the farmers, the axe would not so frequently be laid to your</p>\n<p>roots.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Monkeys and Their Mother</h3>\n<p>THE MONKEY, it is said, has two young ones at each birth.</p>\n<p>The Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care,</p>\n<p>but hates and neglects the other.</p>\n<p>It happened once that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered</p>\n<p>by the too great affection of the Mother, while the despised one was nurtured</p>\n<p>and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was exposed.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Hare and the Hound</h3>\n<p>A HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave up the chase.</p>\n<p>A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying “The little one is the best</p>\n<p>runner of the two.” The Hound replied, “You do not see the difference between</p>\n<p>us: I was only running for a dinner, but he for his life.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Shepherd and the Dog</h3>\n<p>A SHEPHERD penning his sheep in the fold for the night was about to shut up a</p>\n<p>wolf with them, when his Dog perceiving the wolf said, “Master, how can you</p>\n<p>expect the sheep to be safe if you admit a wolf into the fold?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Oak and the Woodcutters</h3>\n<p>THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces, making wedges of</p>\n<p>its own branches for dividing the trunk.</p>\n<p>The Oak said with a sigh, “I do not care about the blows of the axe aimed at my</p>\n<p>roots, but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by these wedges made from my own</p>\n<p>branches.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wasp and the Snake</h3>\n<p>A WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking him unceasingly</p>\n<p>with his stings, wounded him to death.</p>\n<p>The Snake, being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his</p>\n<p>enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and purposely placed his</p>\n<p>head under the wheels, saying, “At least my enemy and I shall perish together.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Peacock and the Crane</h3>\n<p>A PEACOCK spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that passed by, ridiculing</p>\n<p>the ashen hue of its plumage and saying, “I am robed, like a king, in gold and</p>\n<p>purple and all the colors of the rainbow; while you have not a bit of color on</p>\n<p>your wings.” “True,” replied the Crane; “but I soar to the heights of heaven</p>\n<p>and lift up my voice to the stars, while you walk below, like a cock, among the</p>\n<p>birds of the dunghill.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Hen and the Golden Eggs</h3>\n<p>A COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every day.</p>\n<p>They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold in its inside, and</p>\n<p>in order to get the gold they killed it.</p>\n<p>Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen differed in no</p>\n<p>respect from their other hens.</p>\n<p>The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves</p>\n<p>of the gain of which they were assured day by day.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Ass and the Frogs</h3>\n<p>AN ASS, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond.</p>\n<p>As he was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and fell,</p>\n<p>and not being able to rise on account of his load, groaned heavily.</p>\n<p>Some Frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation, and said, “What would</p>\n<p>you do if you had to live here always as we do, when you make such a fuss about</p>\n<p>a mere fall into the water?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Crow and the Raven</h3>\n<p>A CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a bird of good omen</p>\n<p>and always attracted the attention of men, who noted by his flight the good or</p>\n<p>evil course of future events.</p>\n<p>Seeing some travelers approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and perching</p>\n<p>herself on one of the branches, cawed as loudly as she could.</p>\n<p>The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what it foreboded, when one</p>\n<p>of them said to his companion, “Let us proceed on our journey, my friend, for</p>\n",
        "<p>it is only the caw of a crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Trees and the Axe</h3>\n<p>A MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a handle for his</p>\n<p>axe.</p>\n<p>The Trees consented to his request and gave him a young ash-tree.</p>\n<p>No sooner had the man fitted a new handle to his axe from it, than he began to</p>\n<p>use it and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest.</p>\n<p>An old oak, lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said to</p>\n<p>a neighboring cedar, “The first step has lost us all.</p>\n",
        "<p>If we had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have retained our</p>\n<p>own privileges and have stood for ages.”</p>\n",

        "<p>“has been assigned by the will of the Fates—to thee, beauty; to the eagle,</p>\n<p>strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven, favourable, and to the crow,</p>\n<p>unfavourable auguries.</p>\n<p>These are all contented with the endowments allotted to them.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wolf and the Shepherd</h3>\n<p>A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to injure</p>\n<p>one of them.</p>\n<p>The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against him, as against an enemy, and</p>\n<p>kept a strict watch over his movements.</p>\n<p>But when the Wolf, day after day, kept in the company of the sheep and did not</p>\n<p>make the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as</p>\n<p>a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and when</p>\n",
        "<p>occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep entirely in his</p>\n<p>charge.</p>\n<p>The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed</p>\n<p>the greater part of the flock.</p>\n<p>When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he exclaimed: “I have</p>\n<p>been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Hares and the Lions</h3>\n<p>THE HARES harangued the assembly, and argued that all should be equal.</p>\n<p>The Lions made this reply: “Your words, O Hares!</p>\n<p>are good; but they lack both claws and teeth such as we have.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Seller of Images</h3>\n<p>A CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image of Mercury and offered it for sale.</p>\n<p>When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to attract purchasers, he</p>\n<p>cried out that he had the statue to sell of a benefactor who bestowed wealth</p>\n<p>and helped to heap up riches.</p>\n<p>One of the bystanders said to him, “My good fellow, why do you sell him, being</p>\n<p>such a one as you describe, when you may yourself enjoy the good things he has</p>\n<p>to give?” “Why,” he replied, “I am in need of immediate help, and he is wont to</p>\n",
        "<p>give his good gifts very slowly.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Hawk and the Nightingale</h3>\n<p>A NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to his wont, was</p>\n<p>seen by a Hawk who, being in need of food, swooped down and seized him.</p>\n<p>The Nightingale, about to lose his life, earnestly begged the Hawk to let him</p>\n<p>go, saying that he was not big enough to satisfy the hunger of a Hawk who, if</p>\n<p>he wanted food, ought to pursue the larger birds.</p>\n<p>The Hawk, interrupting him, said: “I should indeed have lost my senses if I</p>\n<p>should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds which are</p>\n",
        "<p>not yet even within sight.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lark and Her Young Ones</h3>\n<p>A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat.</p>\n<p>The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their</p>\n<p>wings and the full plumage of their feathers, when the owner of the field,</p>\n<p>looking over his ripe crop, said, “The time has come when I must ask all my</p>\n<p>neighbors to help me with my harvest.” One of the young Larks heard his speech</p>\n<p>and related it to his mother, inquiring of her to what place they should move</p>\n<p>for safety.</p>\n",
        "<p>“There is no occasion to move yet, my son,” she replied; “the man who only</p>\n<p>sends to his friends to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest.”</p>\n<p>The owner of the field came again a few days later and saw the wheat shedding</p>\n<p>the grain from excess of ripeness.</p>\n<p>He said, “I will come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with as many</p>\n<p>reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest.” The Lark on hearing these</p>\n<p>words said to her brood, “It is time now to be off, my little ones, for the man</p>\n",
        "<p>is in earnest this time; he no longer trusts his friends, but will reap the</p>\n<p>field himself.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox</h3>\n<p>A DOG and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel together.</p>\n<p>At nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood.</p>\n<p>The Cock flying up, perched himself on the branches of a tree, while the Dog</p>\n<p>found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk.</p>\n<p>When the morning dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed very loudly several times.</p>\n<p>A Fox heard the sound, and wishing to make a breakfast on him, came and stood</p>\n<p>under the branches, saying how earnestly he desired to make the acquaintance of</p>\n",
        "<p>the owner of so magnificent a voice.</p>\n<p>The Cock, suspecting his civilities, said: “Sir, I wish you would do me the</p>\n<p>favour of going around to the hollow trunk below me, and waking my porter, so</p>\n<p>that he may open the door and let you in.” When the Fox approached the tree,</p>\n<p>the Dog sprang out and caught him, and tore him to pieces.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Geese and the Cranes</h3>\n<p>THE GEESE and the Cranes were feeding in the same meadow, when a birdcatcher</p>\n<p>came to ensnare them in his nets.</p>\n<p>The Cranes, being light of wing, fled away at his approach; while the Geese,</p>\n<p>being slower of flight and heavier in their bodies, were captured.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Ass and the Wolf</h3>\n<p>AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him, and immediately</p>\n<p>pretended to be lame.</p>\n<p>The Wolf, coming up, inquired the cause of his lameness.</p>\n<p>The Ass replied that passing through a hedge he had trod with his foot upon a</p>\n<p>sharp thorn.</p>\n<p>He requested that the Wolf pull it out, lest when he ate him it should injure</p>\n<p>his throat.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Wolf consented and lifted up the foot, and was giving his whole mind to the</p>\n<p>discovery of the thorn, when the Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth into his</p>\n<p>mouth and galloped away.</p>\n<p>The Wolf, being thus fearfully mauled, said, “I am rightly served, for why did</p>\n<p>I attempt the art of healing, when my father only taught me the trade of a</p>\n<p>butcher?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Goat and the Ass</h3>\n<p>A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass.</p>\n<p>The Goat, envying the Ass on account of his greater abundance of food, said,</p>\n<p>“How shamefully you are treated: at one time grinding in the mill, and at</p>\n<p>another carrying heavy burdens;” and he further advised him to pretend to be</p>\n<p>epileptic and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest.</p>\n<p>The Ass listened to his words, and falling into a ditch, was very much bruised.</p>\n<p>His master, sending for a leech, asked his advice.</p>\n",
        "<p>He bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a Goat.</p>\n<p>They at once killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion and the Bull</h3>\n<p>A LION, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to attack him on</p>\n<p>account of his great size, resorted to a trick to ensure his destruction.</p>\n<p>He approached the Bull and said, “I have slain a fine sheep, my friend; and if</p>\n<p>you will come home and partake of him with me, I shall be delighted to have</p>\n<p>your company.” The Lion said this in the hope that, as the Bull was in the act</p>\n<p>of reclining to eat, he might attack him to advantage, and make his meal on him.</p>\n<p>The Bull, on approaching the Lion’s den, saw the huge spits and giant caldrons,</p>\n",
        "<p>and no sign whatever of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took his</p>\n<p>departure.</p>\n<p>The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without a word of salutation to</p>\n<p>his host, who had not given him any cause for offense.</p>\n<p>“I have reasons enough,” said the Bull.</p>\n<p>“I see no indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep, while I do</p>\n<p>see very plainly every preparation for your dining on a bull.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fox and the Mask</h3>\n<p>A FOX entered the house of an actor and, rummaging through all his properties,</p>\n<p>came upon a Mask, an admirable imitation of a human head.</p>\n<p>He placed his paws on it and said, “What a beautiful head!</p>\n<p>Yet it is of no value, as it entirely lacks brains.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Grasshopper and the Owl</h3>\n<p>AN OWL, accustomed to feed at night and to sleep during the day, was greatly</p>\n<p>disturbed by the noise of a Grasshopper and earnestly besought her to stop</p>\n<p>chirping.</p>\n<p>The Grasshopper refused to desist, and chirped louder and louder the more the</p>\n<p>Owl entreated.</p>\n<p>When she saw that she could get no redress and that her words were despised,</p>\n<p>the Owl attacked the chatterer by a stratagem.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Since I cannot sleep,” she said, “on account of your song which, believe me,</p>\n<p>is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself in drinking some nectar</p>\n<p>which Pallas lately gave me.</p>\n<p>If you do not dislike it, come to me and we will drink it together.” The</p>\n<p>Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of her voice, eagerly</p>\n<p>flew up.</p>\n<p>The Owl came forth from her hollow, seized her, and put her to death.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fowler and the Viper</h3>\n<p>A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch birds.</p>\n<p>Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take it, and fitting his</p>\n<p>twigs to a proper length, watched intently, having his whole thoughts directed</p>\n<p>towards the sky.</p>\n<p>While thus looking upwards, he unknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep just before</p>\n<p>his feet.</p>\n<p>The Viper, turning about, stung him, and falling into a swoon, the man said to</p>\n",
        "<p>himself, “Woe is me!</p>\n<p>that while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares into the</p>\n<p>snares of death.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Horse and the Ass</h3>\n<p>A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway.</p>\n<p>The Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way.</p>\n<p>“Hardly,” said the Horse, “can I resist kicking you with my heels.” The Ass</p>\n<p>held his peace, and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods.</p>\n<p>Not long afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent by his</p>\n<p>owner to the farm.</p>\n<p>The Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided him: “Where, O boaster,</p>\n",
        "<p>are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself reduced to the condition</p>\n<p>you so lately treated with contempt?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion and the Three Bulls</h3>\n<p>THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together.</p>\n<p>A Lion lay in ambush in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to</p>\n<p>attack them while they kept together.</p>\n<p>Having at last by guileful speeches succeeded in separating them, he attacked</p>\n<p>them without fear as they fed alone, and feasted on them one by one at his own</p>\n<p>leisure.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wolf and the Goat</h3>\n<p>A WOLF saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice, where he had no</p>\n<p>chance of reaching her.</p>\n<p>He called to her and earnestly begged her to come lower down, lest she fall by</p>\n<p>some mishap; and he added that the meadows lay where he was standing, and that</p>\n<p>the herbage was most tender.</p>\n<p>She replied, “No, my friend, it is not for the pasture that you invite me, but</p>\n<p>for yourself, who are in want of food.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fly and the Draught-Mule</h3>\n<p>A FLY sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the Draught-Mule said,</p>\n<p>“How slow you are!</p>\n<p>Why do you not go faster?</p>\n<p>See if I do not prick your neck with my sting.” The Draught-Mule replied, “I do</p>\n<p>not heed your threats; I only care for him who sits above you, and who quickens</p>\n<p>my pace with his whip, or holds me back with the reins.</p>\n<p>Away, therefore, with your insolence, for I know well when to go fast, and when</p>\n",
        "<p>to go slow.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fishermen</h3>\n<p>SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets.</p>\n<p>Perceiving them to be very heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that</p>\n<p>they had taken a large catch.</p>\n<p>When they had dragged the nets to the shore they found but few fish: the nets</p>\n<p>were full of sand and stones, and the men were beyond measure cast down so much</p>\n<p>at the disappointment which had befallen them, but because they had formed such</p>\n<p>very different expectations.</p>\n",
        "<p>One of their company, an old man, said, “Let us cease lamenting, my mates, for,</p>\n<p>as it seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it was only to</p>\n<p>be looked for that we, who just now were over-rejoiced, should next have</p>\n<p>something to make us sad.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</h3>\n<p>A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him a visit</p>\n<p>and partake of his country fare.</p>\n<p>As they were on the bare plowlands, eating there wheat-stocks and roots pulled</p>\n<p>up from the hedgerow, the Town Mouse said to his friend, “You live here the</p>\n<p>life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty.</p>\n<p>I am surrounded by every luxury, and if you will come with me, as I wish you</p>\n<p>would, you shall have an ample share of my dainties.” The Country Mouse was</p>\n",
        "<p>easily persuaded, and returned to town with his friend.</p>\n<p>On his arrival, the Town Mouse placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried</p>\n<p>figs, honey, raisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from a</p>\n<p>basket.</p>\n<p>The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer,</p>\n<p>expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate.</p>\n<p>Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran</p>\n",
        "<p>off squeaking, as fast as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only</p>\n<p>find room in it by squeezing.</p>\n<p>They had scarcely begun their repast again when someone else entered to take</p>\n<p>something out of a cupboard, whereupon the two Mice, more frightened than</p>\n<p>before, ran away and hid themselves.</p>\n<p>At last the Country Mouse, almost famished, said to his friend: “Although you</p>\n<p>have prepared for me so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by</p>\n",
        "<p>yourself.</p>\n<p>It is surrounded by too many dangers to please me.</p>\n<p>I prefer my bare plowlands and roots from the hedgerow, where I can live in</p>\n<p>safety, and without fear.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape</h3>\n<p>A WOLF accused a Fox of theft, but the Fox entirely denied the charge.</p>\n<p>An Ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them.</p>\n<p>When each had fully stated his case the Ape announced this sentence: “I do not</p>\n<p>think you, Wolf, ever lost what you claim; and I do believe you, Fox, to have</p>\n<p>stolen what you so stoutly deny.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer</h3>\n<p>THE WASPS and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a Farmer and</p>\n<p>besought him to give them some water to drink.</p>\n<p>They promised amply to repay him the favour which they asked.</p>\n<p>The Partridges declared that they would dig around his vines and make them</p>\n<p>produce finer grapes.</p>\n<p>The Wasps said that they would keep guard and drive off thieves with their</p>\n<p>stings.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the Farmer interrupted them, saying: “I have already two oxen, who, without</p>\n<p>making any promises, do all these things.</p>\n<p>It is surely better for me to give the water to them than to you.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Brother and the Sister</h3>\n<p>A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable for his good</p>\n<p>looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness.</p>\n<p>While they were playing one day as children, they happened by chance to look</p>\n<p>together into a mirror that was placed on their mother’s chair.</p>\n<p>The boy congratulated himself on his good looks; the girl grew angry, and could</p>\n<p>not bear the self-praises of her Brother, interpreting all he said (and how</p>\n<p>could she do otherwise?) into reflection on herself.</p>\n",
        "<p>She ran off to her father, to be avenged on her Brother, and spitefully accused</p>\n<p>him of having, as a boy, made use of that which belonged only to girls.</p>\n<p>The father embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection</p>\n<p>impartially on each, said, “I wish you both would look into the mirror every</p>\n<p>day: you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty by evil conduct; and you,</p>\n<p>my daughter, that you may make up for your lack of beauty by your virtues.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Dogs and the Fox</h3>\n<p>SOME DOGS, finding the skin of a lion, began to tear it in pieces with their</p>\n<p>teeth.</p>\n<p>A Fox, seeing them, said, “If this lion were alive, you would soon find out</p>\n<p>that his claws were stronger than your teeth.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Blind Man and the Whelp</h3>\n<p>A BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by touching them</p>\n<p>with his hands.</p>\n<p>The whelp of a Wolf was brought him, with a request that he would feel it, and</p>\n<p>say what it was.</p>\n<p>He felt it, and being in doubt, said: “I do not quite know whether it is the</p>\n<p>cub of a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full well.</p>\n<p>It would not be safe to admit him to the sheepfold.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Cobbler Turned Doctor</h3>\n<p>A COBBLER unable to make a living by his trade and made desperate by poverty,</p>\n<p>began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not known.</p>\n<p>He sold a drug, pretending that it was an antidote to all poisons, and obtained</p>\n<p>a great name for himself by long-winded puffs and advertisements.</p>\n<p>When the Cobbler happened to fall sick himself of a serious illness, the</p>\n<p>Governor of the town determined to test his skill.</p>\n<p>For this purpose he called for a cup, and while filling it with water,</p>\n",
        "<p>pretended to mix poison with the Cobbler’s antidote, commanding him to drink it</p>\n<p>on the promise of a reward.</p>\n<p>The Cobbler, under the fear of death, confessed that he had no knowledge of</p>\n<p>medicine, and was only made famous by the stupid clamors of the crowd.</p>\n<p>The Governor then called a public assembly and addressed the citizens: “Of what</p>\n<p>folly have you been guilty?</p>\n<p>You have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a man, whom no one could employ</p>\n",
        "<p>to make even the shoes for their feet.”</p>\n",

        "<p>before one had well beaten the other.</p>\n<p>He then said to himself, “I shall no longer distress myself at being struck at</p>\n<p>by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even refrain from quarreling</p>\n<p>with each other.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fox and the Lion</h3>\n<p>A FOX saw a Lion confined in a cage, and standing near him, bitterly reviled</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>The Lion said to the Fox, “It is not thou who revilest me; but this mischance</p>\n<p>which has befallen me.”</p>\n",

        "<h3>The Hen and the Swallow</h3>\n<p>A HEN finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them warm, nourished</p>\n<p>them into life.</p>\n<p>A Swallow, observing what she had done, said, “You silly creature!</p>\n<p>why have you hatched these vipers which, when they shall have grown, will</p>\n<p>inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Rose and the Amaranth</h3>\n<p>AN AMARANTH planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus addressed it: “What a</p>\n<p>lovely flower is the Rose, a favourite alike with Gods and with men.</p>\n<p>I envy you your beauty and your perfume.” The Rose replied, “I indeed, dear</p>\n<p>Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season!</p>\n<p>If no cruel hand pluck me from my stem, yet I must perish by an early doom.</p>\n<p>But thou art immortal and dost never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed</p>\n<p>youth.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Travelers and the Plane-Tree</h3>\n<p>TWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer’s sun, laid themselves down</p>\n<p>at noon under the widespreading branches of a Plane-Tree.</p>\n<p>As they rested under its shade, one of the Travelers said to the other, “What a</p>\n<p>singularly useless tree is the Plane!</p>\n<p>It bears no fruit, and is not of the least service to man.” The Plane-Tree,</p>\n<p>interrupting him, said, “You ungrateful fellows!</p>\n<p>Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting under my shade, dare to</p>\n",
        "<p>describe me as useless, and unprofitable?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Ass and the Horse</h3>\n<p>AN ASS besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his feed.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the Horse; “if any remains out of what I am now eating I will give</p>\n<p>it you for the sake of my own superior dignity, and if you will come when I</p>\n<p>reach my own stall in the evening, I will give you a little sack full of</p>\n<p>barley.” The Ass replied, “Thank you.</p>\n<p>But I can’t think that you, who refuse me a little matter now, will by and by</p>\n<p>confer on me a greater benefit.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Crow and the Sheep</h3>\n<p>A TROUBLESOME CROW seated herself on the back of a Sheep.</p>\n<p>The Sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long</p>\n<p>time, and at last said, “If you had treated a dog in this way, you would have</p>\n<p>had your deserts from his sharp teeth.” To this the Crow replied, “I despise</p>\n<p>the weak and yield to the strong.</p>\n<p>I know whom I may bully and whom I must flatter; and I thus prolong my life to</p>\n<p>a good old age.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Fox and the Bramble</h3>\n<p>A FOX was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught hold of a</p>\n<p>Bramble to save himself.</p>\n<p>Having pricked and grievously torn the soles of his feet, he accused the</p>\n<p>Bramble because, when he had fled to her for assistance, she had used him worse</p>\n<p>than the hedge itself.</p>\n<p>The Bramble, interrupting him, said, “But you really must have been out of your</p>\n<p>senses to fasten yourself on me, who am myself always accustomed to fasten upon</p>\n",
        "<p>others.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Ass and the Charger</h3>\n<p>AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully provided</p>\n<p>for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even that without hard</p>\n<p>work.</p>\n<p>But when war broke out, a heavily armed soldier mounted the Horse, and riding</p>\n<p>him to the charge, rushed into the very midst of the enemy.</p>\n<p>The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated the</p>\n",
        "<p>Horse.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant</h3>\n<p>THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints.</p>\n<p>“It is true, O Jupiter!” he said, “that I am gigantic in strength, handsome in</p>\n<p>shape, and powerful in attack.</p>\n<p>I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet furnished with claws, and I lord</p>\n<p>it over all the beasts of the forest, and what a disgrace it is, that being</p>\n<p>such as I am, I should be frightened by the crowing of a cock.” Jupiter</p>\n<p>replied, “Why do you blame me without a cause?</p>\n",
        "<p>I have given you all the attributes which I possess myself, and your courage</p>\n<p>never fails you except in this one instance.” On hearing this the Lion groaned</p>\n<p>and lamented very much and, reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that</p>\n<p>he might die.</p>\n<p>As these thoughts passed through his mind, he met an Elephant and came close to</p>\n<p>hold a conversation with him.</p>\n<p>After a time he observed that the Elephant shook his ears very often, and he</p>\n",
        "<p>inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor every</p>\n<p>now and then.</p>\n<p>Just at that moment a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied,</p>\n<p>“Do you see that little buzzing insect?</p>\n<p>If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed.</p>\n<p>I should die presently.” The Lion said, “Well, since so huge a beast is afraid</p>\n<p>of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself dead.</p>\n",
        "<p>I find myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Dog and the Oyster</h3>\n<p>A DOG, used to eating eggs, saw an Oyster and, opening his mouth to its widest</p>\n<p>extent, swallowed it down with the utmost relish, supposing it to be an egg.</p>\n<p>Soon afterwards suffering great pain in his stomach, he said, “I deserve all</p>\n<p>this torment, for my folly in thinking that everything round must be an egg.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Mules and the Robbers</h3>\n<p>TWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along.</p>\n<p>One carried panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain.</p>\n<p>The Mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of the</p>\n<p>value of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells fastened to</p>\n<p>his neck.</p>\n<p>His companion followed with quiet and easy step.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden Robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places, and in the</p>\n",
        "<p>scuffle with their owners, wounded with a sword the Mule carrying the treasure,</p>\n<p>which they greedily seized while taking no notice of the grain.</p>\n<p>The Mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his misfortunes.</p>\n<p>The other replied, “I am indeed glad that I was thought so little of, for I</p>\n<p>have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with any wound.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lamb and the Wolf</h3>\n<p>A WOLF pursued a Lamb, which fled for refuge to a certain Temple.</p>\n<p>The Wolf called out to him and said, “The Priest will slay you in sacrifice, if</p>\n<p>he should catch you.” On which the Lamb replied, “It would be better for me to</p>\n<p>be sacrificed in the Temple than to be eaten by you.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Partridge and the Fowler</h3>\n<p>A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it.</p>\n<p>The Partridge earnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, “Pray, master,</p>\n<p>permit me to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for</p>\n<p>your mercy to me.” The Fowler replied, “I shall now with less scruple take your</p>\n<p>life, because you are willing to save it at the cost of betraying your friends</p>\n<p>and relations.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Flea and the Man</h3>\n<p>A MAN, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and said, “Who are</p>\n<p>you who dare to feed on my limbs, and to cost me so much trouble in catching</p>\n<p>you?” The Flea replied, “O my dear sir, pray spare my life, and destroy me not,</p>\n<p>for I cannot possibly do you much harm.” The Man, laughing, replied, “Now you</p>\n<p>shall certainly die by mine own hands, for no evil, whether it be small or</p>\n<p>large, ought to be tolerated.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Rich Man and the Tanner</h3>\n<p>A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the unpleasant smell</p>\n<p>of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away.</p>\n<p>The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he would leave</p>\n<p>soon.</p>\n<p>But as he still continued to stay, as time went on, the rich man became</p>\n<p>accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of inconvenience, made no</p>\n<p>further complaints.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Viper and the File</h3>\n<p>A VIPER, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools the means of</p>\n<p>satisfying his hunger.</p>\n<p>He more particularly addressed himself to a File, and asked of him the favour</p>\n<p>of a meal.</p>\n<p>The File replied, “You must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to</p>\n<p>get anything from me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to</p>\n<p>give anything in return.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Lion and the Shepherd</h3>\n<p>A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn.</p>\n<p>Soon afterward he came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail</p>\n<p>as if to say, “I am a suppliant, and seek your aid.” The Shepherd boldly</p>\n<p>examined the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap,</p>\n<p>pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the forest.</p>\n<p>Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false accusation, was</p>\n<p>condemned “to be cast to the Lions” as the punishment for his imputed crime.</p>\n",
        "<p>But when the Lion was released from his cage, he recognized the Shepherd as the</p>\n<p>man who healed him, and instead of attacking him, approached and placed his</p>\n<p>foot upon his lap.</p>\n<p>The King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again</p>\n<p>in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Camel and Jupiter</h3>\n<p>THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him and wished that</p>\n<p>he himself could obtain the same honours.</p>\n<p>He went to Jupiter, and besought him to give him horns.</p>\n<p>Jupiter, vexed at his request because he was not satisfied with his size and</p>\n<p>strength of body, and desired yet more, not only refused to give him horns, but</p>\n<p>even deprived him of a portion of his ears.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Panther and the Shepherds</h3>\n<p>A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit.</p>\n<p>The Shepherds discovered him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with</p>\n<p>stones, while others, moved with compassion towards one about to die even</p>\n<p>though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life.</p>\n<p>At night they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on</p>\n<p>the morrow they would find him dead.</p>\n<p>The Panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble strength, freed himself</p>\n",
        "<p>with a sudden bound from the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps.</p>\n<p>After a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the</p>\n<p>Shepherds who had attacked him, raged with angry fury.</p>\n<p>Then they who had spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him</p>\n<p>their flocks and begged only for their lives.</p>\n<p>To them the Panther made this reply: “I remember alike those who sought my life</p>\n<p>with stones, and those who gave me food aside, therefore, your fears.</p>\n",
        "<p>I return as an enemy only to those who injured me.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Eagle and the Kite</h3>\n<p>AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree in company</p>\n<p>with a Kite.</p>\n<p>“Why,” said the Kite, “do I see you with such a rueful look?” “I seek,” she</p>\n<p>replied, “a mate suitable for me, and am not able to find one.” “Take me,”</p>\n<p>returned the Kite, “I am much stronger than you are.” “Why, are you able to</p>\n<p>secure the means of living by your plunder?” “Well, I have often caught and</p>\n<p>carried away an ostrich in my talons.” The Eagle, persuaded by these words,</p>\n",
        "<p>accepted him as her mate.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, “Fly off and bring me back the</p>\n<p>ostrich you promised me.” The Kite, soaring aloft into the air, brought back</p>\n<p>the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the length of time it had lain</p>\n<p>about the fields.</p>\n<p>“Is this,” said the Eagle, “the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?”</p>\n<p>The Kite replied, “That I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing that I</p>\n",
        "<p>would not have promised, however much I knew that I must fail in the</p>\n<p>performance.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Eagle and His Captor</h3>\n<p>AN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his wings and put</p>\n<p>him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which treatment the Eagle</p>\n<p>was weighed down with grief.</p>\n<p>Later, another neighbor purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again.</p>\n<p>The Eagle took flight, and pouncing upon a hare, brought it at once as an</p>\n<p>offering to his benefactor.</p>\n<p>A Fox, seeing this, exclaimed, “Do not cultivate the favour of this man, but of</p>\n",
        "<p>your former owner, lest he should again hunt for you and deprive you a second</p>\n<p>time of your wings.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The King’s Son and the Painted Lion</h3>\n<p>A KING, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in which he</p>\n<p>was warned that his son would be killed by a lion.</p>\n<p>Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and</p>\n<p>adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized animals, among</p>\n<p>which was the picture of a lion.</p>\n<p>When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out</p>\n<p>afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said: “O you most detestable of animals!</p>\n",
        "<p>through a lying dream of my father’s, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up</p>\n<p>on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl: what shall I now do to</p>\n<p>you?” With these words he stretched out his hands toward a thorn-tree, meaning</p>\n<p>to cut a stick from its branches so that he might beat the lion.</p>\n<p>But one of the tree’s prickles pierced his finger and caused great pain and</p>\n<p>inflammation, so that the young Prince fell down in a fainting fit.</p>\n<p>A violent fever suddenly set in, from which he died not many days later.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Cat and Venus</h3>\n<p>A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus to change her</p>\n<p>into the form of a woman.</p>\n<p>Venus consented to her request and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so</p>\n<p>that the youth saw her and loved her, and took her home as his bride.</p>\n<p>While the two were reclining in their chamber, Venus wishing to discover if the</p>\n<p>Cat in her change of shape had also altered her habits of life, let down a</p>\n<p>mouse in the middle of the room.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started up from the couch and</p>\n<p>pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it.</p>\n<p>Venus was much disappointed and again caused her to return to her former shape.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Eagle and the Beetle</h3>\n<p>THE EAGLE and the Beetle were at enmity together, and they destroyed one</p>\n<p>another’s nests.</p>\n<p>The Eagle gave the first provocation in seizing upon and in eating the young</p>\n<p>ones of the Beetle.</p>\n<p>The Beetle got by stealth at the Eagle’s eggs, and rolled them out of the nest,</p>\n<p>and followed the Eagle even into the presence of Jupiter.</p>\n<p>On the Eagle making his complaint, Jupiter ordered him to make his nest in his</p>\n",
        "<p>lap; and while Jupiter had the eggs in his lap, the Beetle came flying about</p>\n<p>him, and Jupiter rising up unawares, to drive him away from his head, threw</p>\n<p>down the eggs, and broke them.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The She-Goats and Their Beards</h3>\n<p>THE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, the He-Goats were</p>\n<p>sorely displeased and made complaint that the females equaled them in dignity.</p>\n<p>“Allow them,” said Jupiter, “to enjoy an empty honour and to assume the badge</p>\n<p>of your nobler sex, so long as they are not your equals in strength or courage.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Bald Man and the Fly</h3>\n<p>A FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy it, gave</p>\n<p>himself a heavy slap.</p>\n<p>Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, “You who have wished to revenge, even with</p>\n<p>death, the Prick of a tiny insect, see what you have done to yourself to add</p>\n<p>insult to injury?” The Bald Man replied, “I can easily make peace with myself,</p>\n<p>because I know there was no intention to hurt.</p>\n<p>But you, an ill-favoured and contemptible insect who delights in sucking human</p>\n",
        "<p>blood, I wish that I could have killed you even if I had incurred a heavier</p>\n<p>penalty.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea</h3>\n<p>A SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept after his</p>\n<p>buffetings with the deep.</p>\n<p>After a while he awoke, and looking upon the Sea, loaded it with reproaches.</p>\n<p>He argued that it enticed men with the calmness of its looks, but when it had</p>\n<p>induced them to plow its waters, it grew rough and destroyed them.</p>\n<p>The Sea, assuming the form of a woman, replied to him: “Blame not me, my good</p>\n<p>sir, but the winds, for I am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this</p>\n",
        "<p>earth; but the winds suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me</p>\n<p>into fury.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Buffoon and the Countryman</h3>\n<p>A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to the people, and gave</p>\n<p>a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who invented a new</p>\n<p>amusement for the occasion.</p>\n<p>Various public performers contended for the prize.</p>\n<p>Among them came a Buffoon well known among the populace for his jokes, and said</p>\n<p>that he had a kind of entertainment which had never been brought out on any</p>\n<p>stage before.</p>\n",
        "<p>This report being spread about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded</p>\n<p>in every part.</p>\n<p>The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any apparatus or</p>\n<p>confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused an intense silence.</p>\n<p>He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and imitated the squeaking of a</p>\n<p>little pig so admirably with his voice that the audience declared he had a</p>\n<p>porker under his cloak, and demanded that it should be shaken out.</p>\n",
        "<p>When that was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and loaded</p>\n<p>him with the loudest applause.</p>\n<p>A Countryman in the crowd, observing all that has passed, said, “So help me,</p>\n<p>Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!” and at once proclaimed that he</p>\n<p>would do the same thing on the next day, though in a much more natural way.</p>\n<p>On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theater, but now partiality</p>\n<p>for their favourite actor very generally prevailed, and the audience came</p>\n",
        "<p>rather to ridicule the Countryman than to see the spectacle.</p>\n<p>Both of the performers appeared on the stage.</p>\n<p>The Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as on the preceding</p>\n<p>day, the applause and cheers of the spectators.</p>\n<p>Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a little pig</p>\n<p>beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not suspected by the audience )</p>\n<p>contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to squeak.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent that the Buffoon had given a far</p>\n<p>more exact imitation, and clamored for the Countryman to be kicked out of the</p>\n<p>theater.</p>\n<p>On this the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the</p>\n<p>most positive proof the greatness of their mistake.</p>\n<p>“Look here,” he said, “this shows what sort of judges you are.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Crow and the Serpent</h3>\n<p>A CROW in great want of food saw a Serpent asleep in a sunny nook, and flying</p>\n<p>down, greedily seized him.</p>\n<p>The Serpent, turning about, bit the Crow with a mortal wound.</p>\n<p>In the agony of death, the bird exclaimed: “O unhappy me!</p>\n<p>who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the source of my</p>\n<p>destruction.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Hunter and the Horseman</h3>\n<p>A CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his shoulders and set</p>\n<p>out homewards.</p>\n<p>On his way he met a man on horseback who begged the hare of him, under the</p>\n<p>pretense of purchasing it.</p>\n<p>However, when the Horseman got the hare, he rode off as fast as he could.</p>\n<p>The Hunter ran after him, as if he was sure of overtaking him, but the Horseman</p>\n<p>increased more and more the distance between them.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Hunter, sorely against his will, called out to him and said, “Get along</p>\n<p>with you!</p>\n<p>for I will now make you a present of the hare.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree</h3>\n<p>THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all the year</p>\n<p>round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons.</p>\n<p>A shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage, it</p>\n<p>settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at once</p>\n<p>despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree.</p>\n<p>But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the</p>\n<p>ground, and did not injure it at all.</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Frogs’ Complaint Against the Sun</h3>\n<p>ONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun announced his intention to take a wife, the</p>\n<p>Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky.</p>\n<p>Jupiter, disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the cause of their</p>\n<p>complaint.</p>\n<p>One of them said, “The Sun, now while he is single, parches up the marsh, and</p>\n<p>compels us to die miserably in our arid homes.</p>\n<p>What will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?”</p>\n",
        "<h3>The Brazier and His Dog</h3>\n<p>A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favourite with his master, and</p>\n<p>his constant companion.</p>\n<p>While he hammered away at his metals the Dog slept; but when, on the other</p>\n<p>hand, he went to dinner and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail,</p>\n<p>as if he would ask for a share of his meal.</p>\n<p>His master one day, pretending to be angry and shaking his stick at him, said,</p>\n<p>“You wretched little sluggard!</p>\n",
        "<p>what shall I do to you?</p>\n<p>While I am hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when I begin to</p>\n<p>eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food.</p>\n<p>Do you not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that none but</p>\n<p>those who work are entitled to eat?”</p>\n",
