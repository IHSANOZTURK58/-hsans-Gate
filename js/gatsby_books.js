        "<h3>Chapter I</h3>\n<p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice</p>\n<p>that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.</p>\n<p>“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just</p>\n<p>remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages</p>\n<p>that you’ve had.”</p>\n<p>He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative</p>",
        "<p>in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more</p>\n<p>than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a</p>\n<p>habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me</p>\n<p>the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to</p>\n<p>detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal</p>\n<p>person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of</p>\n<p>being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,</p>",
        "<p>unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have</p>\n<p>feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by</p>\n<p>some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on</p>\n<p>the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least</p>\n<p>the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and</p>\n<p>marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of</p>\n<p>infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I</p>",
        "<p>forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly</p>\n<p>repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out</p>\n<p>unequally at birth.</p>\n<p>And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission</p>\n<p>that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the</p>\n<p>wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded</p>\n<p>on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted</p>",
        "<p>the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I</p>\n<p>wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the</p>\n<p>human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was</p>\n<p>exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I</p>\n<p>have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of</p>\n<p>successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some</p>\n<p>heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related</p>",
        "<p>to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten</p>\n<p>thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that</p>\n<p>flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the</p>\n<p>“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a</p>\n<p>romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and</p>\n<p>which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out</p>\n<p>all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust</p>",
        "<p>floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my</p>\n<p>interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.</p>\n<p>My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle</p>\n<p>Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a</p>\n<p>clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of</p>\n<p>Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s</p>\n<p>brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil</p>",
        "<p>War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father</p>\n<p>carries on today.</p>\n<p>I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with</p>\n<p>special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in</p>\n<p>father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of</p>\n<p>a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that</p>\n<p>delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the</p>",
        "<p>counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being</p>\n<p>the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the</p>\n<p>ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond</p>\n<p>business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it</p>\n<p>could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it</p>\n<p>over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,</p>\n<p>“Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance</p>",
        "<p>me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I</p>\n<p>thought, in the spring of twenty-two.</p>\n<p>The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm</p>\n<p>season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly</p>\n<p>trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a</p>\n<p>house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He</p>\n<p>found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a</p>",
        "<p>month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and</p>\n<p>I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a</p>\n<p>few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who</p>\n<p>made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to</p>\n<p>herself over the electric stove.</p>\n<p>It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more</p>\n<p>recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.</p>",
        "<p>“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.</p>\n<p>I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,</p>\n<p>a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the</p>\n<p>freedom of the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the</p>\n<p>trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar</p>\n<p>conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.</p>",
        "<p>There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to</p>\n<p>be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen</p>\n<p>volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they</p>\n<p>stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,</p>\n<p>promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and</p>\n<p>Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other</p>\n<p>books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a</p>",
        "<p>series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now</p>\n<p>I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become</p>\n<p>again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.”</p>\n<p>This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at</p>\n<p>from a single window, after all.</p>\n<p>It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of</p>\n<p>the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender</p>",
        "<p>riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where</p>\n<p>there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of</p>\n<p>land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in</p>\n<p>contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most</p>\n<p>domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great</p>\n<p>wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the</p>\n<p>egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact</p>",
        "<p>end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual</p>\n<p>wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more</p>\n<p>interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular</p>\n<p>except shape and size.</p>\n<p>I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though</p>\n<p>this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little</p>\n<p>sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the</p>",
        "<p>egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge</p>\n<p>places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on</p>\n<p>my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual</p>\n<p>imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one</p>\n<p>side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble</p>\n<p>swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a</p>",
        "<p>mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an</p>\n<p>eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I</p>\n<p>had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and</p>\n<p>the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a</p>\n<p>month.</p>\n<p>Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg</p>\n<p>glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins</p>",
        "<p>on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom</p>\n<p>Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom</p>\n<p>in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in</p>\n<p>Chicago.</p>\n<p>Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of</p>\n<p>the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a</p>\n<p>national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute</p>",
        "<p>limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of</p>\n<p>anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his</p>\n<p>freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago</p>\n<p>and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for</p>\n<p>instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake</p>\n<p>Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was</p>\n<p>wealthy enough to do that.</p>",
        "<p>Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for</p>\n<p>no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully</p>\n<p>wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a</p>\n<p>permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe</p>\n<p>it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift</p>\n<p>on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of</p>\n<p>some irrecoverable football game.</p>",
        "<p>And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East</p>\n<p>Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house</p>\n<p>was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white</p>\n<p>Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at</p>\n<p>the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,</p>\n<p>jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when</p>\n<p>it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though</p>",
        "<p>from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French</p>\n<p>windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm</p>\n<p>windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with</p>\n<p>his legs apart on the front porch.</p>\n<p>He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy</p>\n<p>straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a</p>\n<p>supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established</p>",
        "<p>dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning</p>\n<p>aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding</p>\n<p>clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill</p>\n<p>those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could</p>\n<p>see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his</p>\n<p>thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.</p>\n<p>His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of</p>",
        "<p>fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in</p>\n<p>it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who</p>\n<p>had hated his guts.</p>\n<p>“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to</p>\n<p>say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We</p>\n<p>were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I</p>\n<p>always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like</p>",
        "<p>him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.</p>\n<p>We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about</p>\n<p>restlessly.</p>\n<p>Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the</p>\n<p>front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half</p>\n<p>acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped</p>",
        "<p>the tide offshore.</p>\n<p>“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,</p>\n<p>politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”</p>\n<p>We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,</p>\n<p>fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The</p>\n<p>windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside</p>\n<p>that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through</p>",
        "<p>the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale</p>\n<p>flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the</p>\n<p>ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow</p>\n<p>on it as wind does on the sea.</p>\n<p>The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous</p>\n<p>couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an</p>\n<p>anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were</p>",
        "<p>rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a</p>\n<p>short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments</p>\n<p>listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a</p>\n<p>picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the</p>\n<p>rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the</p>\n<p>curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the</p>\n<p>floor.</p>",
        "<p>The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full</p>\n<p>length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her</p>\n<p>chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which</p>\n<p>was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes</p>\n<p>she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring</p>\n<p>an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.</p>\n<p>The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly</p>",
        "<p>forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,</p>\n<p>charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”</p>\n<p>She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my</p>\n<p>hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was</p>\n<p>no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she</p>",
        "<p>had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was</p>\n<p>Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people</p>\n<p>lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less</p>\n<p>charming.)</p>\n<p>At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost</p>\n<p>imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object</p>\n<p>she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her</p>",
        "<p>something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.</p>\n<p>Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned</p>\n<p>tribute from me.</p>\n<p>I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,</p>\n<p>thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and</p>\n<p>down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be</p>\n<p>played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,</p>",
        "<p>bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement</p>\n<p>in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:</p>\n<p>a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had</p>\n<p>done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,</p>\n<p>exciting things hovering in the next hour.</p>\n<p>I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,</p>\n<p>and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.</p>",
        "<p>“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.</p>\n<p>“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel</p>\n<p>painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all</p>\n<p>night along the north shore.”</p>\n<p>“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added</p>\n<p>irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”</p>\n<p>“I’d like to.”</p>",
        "<p>“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”</p>\n<p>“Never.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”</p>\n<p>Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped</p>\n<p>and rested his hand on my shoulder.</p>\n<p>“What you doing, Nick?”</p>\n<p>“I’m a bond man.”</p>",
        "<p>“Who with?”</p>\n<p>I told him.</p>\n<p>“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.</p>\n<p>This annoyed me.</p>\n<p>“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at</p>\n<p>Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something</p>",
        "<p>more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”</p>\n<p>At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that</p>\n<p>I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the</p>\n<p>room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned</p>\n<p>and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.</p>\n<p>“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long</p>\n<p>as I can remember.”</p>",
        "<p>“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to</p>\n<p>New York all afternoon.”</p>\n<p>“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the</p>\n<p>pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”</p>\n<p>Her host looked at her incredulously.</p>\n<p>“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom</p>\n<p>of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”</p>",
        "<p>I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I</p>\n<p>enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with</p>\n<p>an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward</p>\n<p>at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked</p>\n<p>back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,</p>\n<p>discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a</p>\n<p>picture of her, somewhere before.</p>",
        "<p>“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody</p>\n<p>there.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know a single—”</p>\n<p>“You must know Gatsby.”</p>\n<p>“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”</p>\n<p>Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;</p>\n<p>wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled</p>",
        "<p>me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.</p>\n<p>Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two</p>\n<p>young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward</p>\n<p>the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the</p>\n<p>diminished wind.</p>\n<p>“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her</p>\n<p>fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She</p>",
        "<p>looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day</p>\n<p>of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in</p>\n<p>the year and then miss it.”</p>\n<p>“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the</p>\n<p>table as if she were getting into bed.</p>\n<p>“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me</p>\n<p>helplessly: “What do people plan?”</p>",
        "<p>Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her</p>\n<p>little finger.</p>\n<p>“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”</p>\n<p>We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.</p>\n<p>“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to,</p>\n<p>but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a</p>\n<p>great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”</p>",
        "<p>“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in</p>\n<p>kidding.”</p>\n<p>“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.</p>\n<p>Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a</p>\n<p>bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool</p>\n<p>as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all</p>\n<p>desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a</p>",
        "<p>polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew</p>\n<p>that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too</p>\n<p>would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the</p>\n<p>West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its</p>\n<p>close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer</p>\n<p>nervous dread of the moment itself.</p>\n<p>“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass</p>",
        "<p>of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or</p>\n<p>something?”</p>\n<p>I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in</p>\n<p>an unexpected way.</p>\n<p>“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve</p>\n<p>gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise</p>\n<p>of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”</p>",
        "<p>“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.</p>\n<p>“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is</p>\n<p>if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly</p>\n<p>submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”</p>\n<p>“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of</p>\n<p>unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in</p>\n<p>them. What was that word we—”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her</p>\n<p>impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to</p>\n<p>us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will</p>\n<p>have control of things.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously</p>\n<p>toward the fervent sun.</p>\n<p>“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom</p>",
        "<p>interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.</p>\n<p>“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,</p>\n<p>and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a</p>\n<p>slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the</p>\n<p>things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all</p>\n<p>that. Do you see?”</p>\n<p>There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his</p>",
        "<p>complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.</p>\n<p>When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler</p>\n<p>left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned</p>\n<p>towards me.</p>\n<p>“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>“It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s</p>\n<p>nose?”</p>",
        "<p>“That’s why I came over tonight.”</p>\n<p>“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher</p>\n<p>for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred</p>\n<p>people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it</p>\n<p>began to affect his nose—”</p>\n<p>“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up</p>",
        "<p>his position.”</p>\n<p>For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her</p>\n<p>glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I</p>\n<p>listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering</p>\n<p>regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.</p>\n<p>The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,</p>\n<p>whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went</p>",
        "<p>inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned</p>\n<p>forward again, her voice glowing and singing.</p>\n<p>“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an</p>\n<p>absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:</p>\n<p>“An absolute rose?”</p>\n<p>This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only</p>\n<p>extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart</p>",
        "<p>was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,</p>\n<p>thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and</p>\n<p>excused herself and went into the house.</p>\n<p>Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of</p>\n<p>meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”</p>\n<p>in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the</p>\n<p>room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to</p>",
        "<p>hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,</p>\n<p>mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.</p>\n<p>“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.</p>\n<p>“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”</p>\n<p>“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.</p>\n<p>“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.</p>\n<p>“I thought everybody knew.”</p>",
        "<p>“I don’t.”</p>\n<p>“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”</p>\n<p>“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.</p>\n<p>Miss Baker nodded.</p>\n<p>“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.</p>\n<p>Don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a</p>",
        "<p>dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at</p>\n<p>the table.</p>\n<p>“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.</p>\n<p>She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and</p>\n<p>continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic</p>\n<p>outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a</p>\n<p>nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing</p>",
        "<p>away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light</p>\n<p>enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”</p>\n<p>The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head</p>\n<p>decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,</p>\n<p>vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes</p>\n<p>at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I</p>",
        "<p>was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to</p>\n<p>avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but</p>\n<p>I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain</p>\n<p>hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill</p>\n<p>metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation</p>\n<p>might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone</p>\n<p>immediately for the police.</p>",
        "<p>The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss</p>\n<p>Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into</p>\n<p>the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,</p>\n<p>trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed</p>\n<p>Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In</p>\n<p>its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.</p>\n<p>Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and</p>",
        "<p>her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that</p>\n<p>turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be</p>\n<p>some sedative questions about her little girl.</p>\n<p>“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even</p>\n<p>if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t back from the war.”</p>\n<p>“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,</p>",
        "<p>and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”</p>\n<p>Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more,</p>\n<p>and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her</p>\n<p>daughter.</p>\n<p>“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you</p>\n<p>what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”</p>",
        "<p>“Very much.”</p>\n<p>“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was</p>\n<p>less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of</p>\n<p>the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right</p>\n<p>away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I</p>\n<p>turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a</p>\n<p>girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be</p>",
        "<p>in this world, a beautiful little fool.’</p>\n<p>“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a</p>\n<p>convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I</p>\n<p>know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.”</p>\n<p>Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and</p>\n<p>she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m</p>\n<p>sophisticated!”</p>",
        "<p>The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my</p>\n<p>belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me</p>\n<p>uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to</p>\n<p>exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a</p>\n<p>moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as</p>\n<p>if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret</p>\n<p>society to which she and Tom belonged.</p>",
        "<p>Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at</p>\n<p>either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the</p>\n<p>Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running</p>\n<p>together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and</p>\n<p>dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as</p>\n<p>she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.</p>\n<p>When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.</p>",
        "<p>“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in</p>\n<p>our very next issue.”</p>\n<p>Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she</p>\n<p>stood up.</p>\n<p>“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the</p>\n<p>ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”</p>\n<p>“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,</p>",
        "<p>“over at Westchester.”</p>\n<p>“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”</p>\n<p>I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous</p>\n<p>expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the</p>\n<p>sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard</p>\n<p>some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I</p>\n<p>had forgotten long ago.</p>",
        "<p>“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”</p>\n<p>“If you’ll get up.”</p>\n<p>“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”</p>\n<p>“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a</p>\n<p>marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you</p>\n<p>together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push</p>\n<p>you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”</p>",
        "<p>“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a</p>\n<p>word.”</p>\n<p>“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let</p>\n<p>her run around the country this way.”</p>\n<p>“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.</p>\n<p>“Her family.”</p>\n<p>“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s</p>",
        "<p>going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots</p>\n<p>of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be</p>\n<p>very good for her.”</p>\n<p>Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.</p>\n<p>“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.</p>\n<p>“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our</p>\n<p>beautiful white—”</p>",
        "<p>“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”</p>\n<p>demanded Tom suddenly.</p>\n<p>“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we</p>\n<p>talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept</p>\n<p>up on us and first thing you know—”</p>\n<p>“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.</p>\n<p>I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes</p>",
        "<p>later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood</p>\n<p>side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor</p>\n<p>Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!</p>\n<p>“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were</p>\n<p>engaged to a girl out West.”</p>\n<p>“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were</p>\n<p>engaged.”</p>",
        "<p>“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”</p>\n<p>“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again</p>\n<p>in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be</p>\n<p>true.”</p>\n<p>Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even</p>\n<p>vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one</p>\n<p>of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old</p>",
        "<p>friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention</p>\n<p>of being rumoured into marriage.</p>\n<p>Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely</p>\n<p>rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove</p>\n<p>away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out</p>\n<p>of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such</p>\n<p>intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman</p>",
        "<p>in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been</p>\n<p>depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of</p>\n<p>stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his</p>\n<p>peremptory heart.</p>\n<p>Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside</p>\n<p>garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and</p>\n<p>when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and</p>",
        "<p>sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had</p>\n<p>blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the</p>\n<p>trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth</p>\n<p>blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered</p>\n<p>across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I</p>\n<p>was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of</p>\n<p>my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets</p>",
        "<p>regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely</p>\n<p>movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested</p>\n<p>that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was</p>\n<p>his of our local heavens.</p>\n<p>I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and</p>\n<p>that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he</p>\n<p>gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched</p>",
        "<p>out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was</p>\n<p>from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced</p>\n<p>seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute</p>\n<p>and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked</p>\n<p>once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the</p>\n<p>unquiet darkness.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter II</h3>\n<p>About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily</p>\n<p>joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as</p>\n<p>to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley</p>\n<p>of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and</p>\n<p>hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and</p>\n<p>chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of</p>",
        "<p>ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery</p>\n<p>air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,</p>\n<p>gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the</p>\n<p>ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable</p>\n<p>cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.</p>\n<p>But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift</p>\n<p>endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.</p>",
        "<p>J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and</p>\n<p>gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,</p>\n<p>but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass</p>\n<p>over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set</p>\n<p>them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then</p>\n<p>sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved</p>\n<p>away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun</p>",
        "<p>and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.</p>\n<p>The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,</p>\n<p>when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on</p>\n<p>waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an</p>\n<p>hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was</p>\n<p>because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.</p>\n<p>The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His</p>",
        "<p>acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés</p>\n<p>with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with</p>\n<p>whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire</p>\n<p>to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one</p>\n<p>afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet</p>\n<p>and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”</p>",
        "<p>I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination</p>\n<p>to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption</p>\n<p>was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.</p>\n<p>I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked</p>\n<p>back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s</p>\n<p>persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of</p>\n<p>yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact</p>",
        "<p>Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p>One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an</p>\n<p>all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a</p>\n<p>garage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed</p>\n<p>Tom inside.</p>\n<p>The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the</p>\n<p>dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had</p>",
        "<p>occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that</p>\n<p>sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the</p>\n<p>proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands</p>\n<p>on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and</p>\n<p>faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his</p>\n<p>light blue eyes.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the</p>",
        "<p>shoulder. “How’s business?”</p>\n<p>“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you</p>\n<p>going to sell me that car?”</p>\n<p>“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”</p>\n<p>“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”</p>\n<p>“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it,</p>\n<p>maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”</p>",
        "<p>“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant—”</p>\n<p>His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.</p>\n<p>Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish</p>\n<p>figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was</p>\n<p>in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh</p>\n<p>sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark</p>\n<p>blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there</p>",
        "<p>was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of</p>\n<p>her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking</p>\n<p>through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,</p>\n<p>looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without</p>\n<p>turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:</p>\n<p>“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little</p>",
        "<p>office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A</p>\n<p>white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled</p>\n<p>everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.</p>\n<p>“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”</p>\n<p>“All right.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”</p>\n<p>She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with</p>",
        "<p>two chairs from his office door.</p>\n<p>We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days</p>\n<p>before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was</p>\n<p>setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.</p>\n<p>“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor</p>\n<p>Eckleburg.</p>\n<p>“Awful.”</p>",
        "<p>“It does her good to get away.”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t her husband object?”</p>\n<p>“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so</p>\n<p>dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”</p>\n<p>So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not</p>\n<p>quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom</p>\n<p>deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might</p>",
        "<p>be on the train.</p>\n<p>She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched</p>\n<p>tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in</p>\n<p>New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a</p>\n<p>moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream</p>\n<p>and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive</p>\n<p>she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,</p>",
        "<p>lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from</p>\n<p>the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she</p>\n<p>turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the</p>\n<p>front glass.</p>\n<p>“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get</p>\n<p>one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”</p>\n<p>We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John</p>",
        "<p>D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very</p>\n<p>recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.</p>\n<p>“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the</p>\n<p>taxi-window.</p>\n<p>“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”</p>\n<p>“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got</p>\n<p>that kind?”</p>",
        "<p>The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and</p>\n<p>drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.</p>\n<p>“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment</p>\n<p>in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the</p>\n<p>brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog</p>\n<p>that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”</p>",
        "<p>“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is</p>\n<p>it?”</p>\n<p>“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten</p>\n<p>dollars.”</p>\n<p>The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it</p>\n<p>somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and</p>\n<p>settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the</p>",
        "<p>weatherproof coat with rapture.</p>\n<p>“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.</p>\n<p>“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy</p>\n<p>ten more dogs with it.”</p>\n<p>We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the</p>\n<p>summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great</p>",
        "<p>flock of white sheep turn the corner.</p>\n<p>“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”</p>\n<p>“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you</p>\n<p>don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”</p>\n<p>“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said</p>\n<p>to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d like to, but—”</p>",
        "<p>We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.</p>\n<p>At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of</p>\n<p>apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the</p>\n<p>neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other</p>\n<p>purchases, and went haughtily in.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in</p>\n<p>the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”</p>",
        "<p>The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small</p>\n<p>dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded</p>\n<p>to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for</p>\n<p>it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of</p>\n<p>ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an</p>\n<p>over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.</p>\n<p>Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a</p>",
        "<p>bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the</p>\n<p>room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with</p>\n<p>a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines</p>\n<p>of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant</p>\n<p>elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he</p>\n<p>added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of</p>\n<p>which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all</p>",
        "<p>afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked</p>\n<p>bureau door.</p>\n<p>I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that</p>\n<p>afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,</p>\n<p>although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful</p>\n<p>sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the</p>\n<p>telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some</p>",
        "<p>at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both</p>\n<p>disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a</p>\n<p>chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the</p>\n<p>whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.</p>\n<p>Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called</p>\n<p>each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive</p>\n<p>at the apartment door.</p>",
        "<p>The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,</p>\n<p>with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky</p>\n<p>white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more</p>\n<p>rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the</p>\n<p>old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about</p>\n<p>there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets</p>\n<p>jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary</p>",
        "<p>haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I</p>\n<p>wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed</p>\n<p>immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a</p>\n<p>girl friend at a hotel.</p>\n<p>Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just</p>\n<p>shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he</p>\n<p>was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He</p>",
        "<p>informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later</p>\n<p>that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of</p>\n<p>Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His</p>\n<p>wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with</p>\n<p>pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven</p>\n<p>times since they had been married.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now</p>",
        "<p>attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,</p>\n<p>which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With</p>\n<p>the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a</p>\n<p>change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage</p>\n<p>was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her</p>\n<p>assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she</p>\n<p>expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be</p>",
        "<p>revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.</p>\n<p>“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of</p>\n<p>these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I</p>\n<p>had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me</p>\n<p>the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”</p>\n<p>“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own</p>",
        "<p>homes.”</p>\n<p>“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes</p>\n<p>when I don’t care what I look like.”</p>\n<p>“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs.</p>\n<p>McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could</p>",
        "<p>make something of it.”</p>\n<p>We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair</p>\n<p>from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr.</p>\n<p>McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved</p>\n<p>his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.</p>\n<p>“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to</p>\n<p>bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of</p>",
        "<p>all the back hair.”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think</p>\n<p>it’s—”</p>\n<p>Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again,</p>\n<p>whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.</p>\n<p>“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and</p>\n<p>mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”</p>",
        "<p>“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair</p>\n<p>at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to</p>\n<p>keep after them all the time.”</p>\n<p>She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to</p>\n<p>the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying</p>\n<p>that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.</p>\n<p>“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.</p>",
        "<p>Tom looked at him blankly.</p>\n<p>“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”</p>\n<p>“Two what?” demanded Tom.</p>\n<p>“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the</p>\n<p>other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”</p>\n<p>The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.</p>\n<p>“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.</p>",
        "<p>“I live at West Egg.”</p>\n<p>“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”</p>\n<p>“I live next door to him.”</p>\n<p>“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s</p>\n<p>where all his money comes from.”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>",
        "<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”</p>\n<p>This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs.</p>\n<p>McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:</p>\n<p>“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but</p>\n<p>Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry.</p>",
        "<p>All I ask is that they should give me a start.”</p>\n<p>“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as</p>\n<p>Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of</p>\n<p>introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”</p>\n<p>“Do what?” she asked, startled.</p>\n<p>“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can</p>\n<p>do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he</p>",
        "<p>invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like</p>\n<p>that.”</p>\n<p>Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:</p>\n<p>“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t they?”</p>\n<p>“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say</p>\n<p>is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them</p>",
        "<p>I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”</p>\n<p>The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had</p>\n<p>overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.</p>\n<p>“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.</p>\n<p>“It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and</p>\n<p>they don’t believe in divorce.”</p>",
        "<p>Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the</p>\n<p>elaborateness of the lie.</p>\n<p>“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West</p>\n<p>to live for a while until it blows over.”</p>\n<p>“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back</p>\n<p>from Monte Carlo.”</p>",
        "<p>“Really.”</p>\n<p>“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”</p>\n<p>“Stay long?”</p>\n<p>“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of</p>\n<p>Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we</p>\n<p>got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an</p>\n<p>awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”</p>",
        "<p>The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the</p>\n<p>blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee</p>\n<p>called me back into the room.</p>\n<p>“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost</p>\n<p>married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was</p>\n<p>below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below</p>\n<p>you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,</p>\n<p>“at least you didn’t marry him.”</p>\n<p>“I know I didn’t.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the</p>\n<p>difference between your case and mine.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”</p>\n<p>Myrtle considered.</p>",
        "<p>“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said</p>\n<p>finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t</p>\n<p>fit to lick my shoe.”</p>\n<p>“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.</p>\n<p>“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy</p>\n<p>about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that</p>\n<p>man there.”</p>",
        "<p>She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I</p>\n<p>tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.</p>\n<p>“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made</p>\n<p>a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and</p>\n<p>never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he</p>\n<p>was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever</p>\n<p>heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to</p>",
        "<p>beat the band all afternoon.”</p>\n<p>“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me.</p>\n<p>“They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the</p>\n<p>first sweetie she ever had.”</p>\n<p>The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all</p>\n<p>present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at</p>\n<p>all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated</p>",
        "<p>sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to</p>\n<p>get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,</p>\n<p>but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident</p>\n<p>argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet</p>\n<p>high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed</p>\n<p>their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening</p>\n<p>streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and</p>",
        "<p>without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible</p>\n<p>variety of life.</p>\n<p>Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath</p>\n<p>poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.</p>\n<p>“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the</p>\n<p>last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my</p>\n<p>sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather</p>",
        "<p>shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked</p>\n<p>at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his</p>\n<p>head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white</p>\n<p>shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call</p>\n<p>a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into</p>\n<p>a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway</p>\n<p>train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live</p>",
        "<p>forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”</p>\n<p>She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial</p>\n<p>laughter.</p>\n<p>“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m</p>\n<p>through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to</p>\n<p>make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave,</p>\n<p>and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where</p>",
        "<p>you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s</p>\n<p>grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t</p>\n<p>forget all the things I got to do.”</p>\n<p>It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch</p>\n<p>and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists</p>\n<p>clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out</p>\n<p>my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that</p>",
        "<p>had worried me all the afternoon.</p>\n<p>The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes</p>\n<p>through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People</p>\n<p>disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost</p>\n<p>each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet</p>\n<p>away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood</p>\n<p>face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson</p>",
        "<p>had any right to mention Daisy’s name.</p>\n<p>“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson. “I’ll say it whenever I</p>\n<p>want to! Daisy! Dai—”</p>\n<p>Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his</p>\n<p>open hand.</p>\n<p>Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s</p>\n<p>voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of</p>",
        "<p>pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the</p>\n<p>door. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the</p>\n<p>scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled</p>\n<p>here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and</p>\n<p>the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to</p>\n<p>spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of</p>\n<p>Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.</p>",
        "<p>Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.</p>\n<p>“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the</p>\n<p>elevator.</p>\n<p>“Where?”</p>\n<p>“Anywhere.”</p>\n<p>“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was</p>",
        "<p>touching it.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”</p>\n<p>… I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the</p>\n<p>sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.</p>\n<p>“Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery Horse … Brook’n</p>\n<p>Bridge …”</p>\n<p>Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the</p>",
        "<p>Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for</p>\n<p>the four o’clock train.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter III</h3>\n<p>There was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights.</p>\n<p>In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the</p>\n<p>whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the</p>\n<p>afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or</p>\n<p>taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats</p>\n<p>slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of</p>",
        "<p>foam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties</p>\n<p>to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past</p>\n<p>midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to</p>\n<p>meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra</p>\n<p>gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers</p>\n<p>and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.</p>\n<p>Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a</p>",
        "<p>fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left</p>\n<p>his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in</p>\n<p>the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in</p>\n<p>half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a</p>\n<p>butler’s thumb.</p>\n<p>At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several</p>\n<p>hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas</p>",
        "<p>tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with</p>\n<p>glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of</p>\n<p>harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark</p>\n<p>gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and</p>\n<p>stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that</p>\n<p>most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.</p>\n<p>By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,</p>",
        "<p>but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and</p>\n<p>cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have</p>\n<p>come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from</p>\n<p>New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and</p>\n<p>salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in</p>\n<p>strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is</p>\n<p>in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden</p>",
        "<p>outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual</p>\n<p>innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic</p>\n<p>meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.</p>\n<p>The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and</p>\n<p>now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of</p>\n<p>voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,</p>\n<p>spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups</p>",
        "<p>change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the</p>\n<p>same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave</p>\n<p>here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,</p>\n<p>joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,</p>\n<p>glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under</p>\n<p>the constantly changing light.</p>\n<p>Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail</p>",
        "<p>out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like</p>\n<p>Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the</p>\n<p>orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a</p>\n<p>burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda</p>\n<p>Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.</p>\n<p>I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one</p>\n<p>of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not</p>",
        "<p>invited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out</p>\n<p>to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there</p>\n<p>they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they</p>\n<p>conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated</p>\n<p>with an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without having</p>\n<p>met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that</p>\n<p>was its own ticket of admission.</p>",
        "<p>I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg</p>\n<p>blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly</p>\n<p>formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s,</p>\n<p>it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen</p>\n<p>me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a</p>\n<p>peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay</p>\n<p>Gatsby, in a majestic hand.</p>",
        "<p>Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after</p>\n<p>seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies</p>\n<p>of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed</p>\n<p>on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of</p>\n<p>young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little</p>\n<p>hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous</p>\n<p>Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or</p>",
        "<p>insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the</p>\n<p>easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few</p>\n<p>words in the right key.</p>\n<p>As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or</p>\n<p>three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an</p>\n<p>amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,</p>\n<p>that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place</p>",
        "<p>in the garden where a single man could linger without looking</p>\n<p>purposeless and alone.</p>\n<p>I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when</p>\n<p>Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble</p>\n<p>steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous</p>\n<p>interest down into the garden.</p>\n<p>Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone</p>",
        "<p>before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.</p>\n<p>“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally</p>\n<p>loud across the garden.</p>\n<p>“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up.</p>\n<p>“I remembered you lived next door to—”</p>\n<p>She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me</p>\n<p>in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who</p>",
        "<p>stopped at the foot of the steps.</p>\n<p>“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”</p>\n<p>That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week</p>\n<p>before.</p>\n<p>“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we</p>\n<p>met you here about a month ago.”</p>\n<p>“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started,</p>",
        "<p>but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to</p>\n<p>the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a</p>\n<p>caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we</p>\n<p>descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of</p>\n<p>cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a</p>\n<p>table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced</p>\n<p>to us as Mr. Mumble.</p>",
        "<p>“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl</p>\n<p>beside her.</p>\n<p>“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an</p>\n<p>alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for</p>\n<p>you, Lucille?”</p>\n<p>It was for Lucille, too.</p>\n<p>“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always</p>",
        "<p>have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and</p>\n<p>he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from</p>\n<p>Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”</p>\n<p>“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.</p>\n<p>“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the</p>\n<p>bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two</p>\n<p>hundred and sixty-five dollars.”</p>",
        "<p>“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”</p>\n<p>said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with</p>\n<p>anybody.”</p>\n<p>“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”</p>\n<p>The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.</p>\n<p>“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”</p>",
        "<p>A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and</p>\n<p>listened eagerly.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s</p>\n<p>more that he was a German spy during the war.”</p>\n<p>One of the men nodded in confirmation.</p>\n<p>“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in</p>\n<p>Germany,” he assured us positively.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in</p>\n<p>the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to</p>\n<p>her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes</p>\n<p>when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”</p>\n<p>She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned</p>\n<p>and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic</p>\n<p>speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those</p>",
        "<p>who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this</p>\n<p>world.</p>\n<p>The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now</p>\n<p>being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were</p>\n<p>spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were</p>\n<p>three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate</p>\n<p>given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that</p>",
        "<p>sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a</p>\n<p>greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had</p>\n<p>preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function</p>\n<p>of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg</p>\n<p>condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its</p>\n<p>spectroscopic gaiety.</p>\n<p>“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and</p>",
        "<p>inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”</p>\n<p>We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I</p>\n<p>had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The</p>\n<p>undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.</p>\n<p>The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not</p>\n<p>there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t</p>\n<p>on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and</p>",
        "<p>walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,</p>\n<p>and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.</p>\n<p>A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was</p>\n<p>sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with</p>\n<p>unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he</p>\n<p>wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.</p>\n<p>“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.</p>",
        "<p>“About what?”</p>\n<p>He waved his hand toward the bookshelves.</p>\n<p>“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I</p>\n<p>ascertained. They’re real.”</p>\n<p>“The books?”</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice</p>",
        "<p>durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.  Pages</p>\n<p>and—Here! Lemme show you.”</p>\n<p>Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and</p>\n<p>returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.</p>\n<p>“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed</p>\n<p>matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a</p>\n<p>triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,</p>",
        "<p>too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”</p>\n<p>He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,</p>\n<p>muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable</p>\n<p>to collapse.</p>\n<p>“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought.</p>\n<p>Most people were brought.”</p>\n<p>Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.</p>",
        "<p>“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud</p>\n<p>Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been</p>\n<p>drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit</p>\n<p>in a library.”</p>\n<p>“Has it?”</p>\n<p>“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour.</p>\n<p>Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”</p>",
        "<p>“You told us.”</p>\n<p>We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.</p>\n<p>There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing</p>\n<p>young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples</p>\n<p>holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the</p>\n<p>corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or</p>\n<p>relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the</p>",
        "<p>traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had</p>\n<p>sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and</p>\n<p>between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,</p>\n<p>while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A</p>\n<p>pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a</p>\n<p>baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than</p>\n<p>finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was</p>",
        "<p>a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny</p>\n<p>drip of the banjoes on the lawn.</p>\n<p>I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man</p>\n<p>of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the</p>\n<p>slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying</p>\n<p>myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene</p>\n<p>had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and</p>",
        "<p>profound.</p>\n<p>At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.</p>\n<p>“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First</p>\n<p>Division during the war?”</p>\n<p>“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”</p>\n<p>“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen</p>\n<p>you somewhere before.”</p>",
        "<p>We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.</p>\n<p>Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just</p>\n<p>bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”</p>\n<p>“What time?”</p>\n<p>“Any time that suits you best.”</p>\n<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked</p>",
        "<p>around and smiled.</p>\n<p>“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.</p>\n<p>“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an</p>\n<p>unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over</p>\n<p>there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and</p>\n<p>this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”</p>\n<p>For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.</p>",
        "<p>“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.</p>\n<p>“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”</p>\n<p>“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”</p>\n<p>He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one</p>\n<p>of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that</p>\n<p>you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to</p>\n<p>face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on</p>",
        "<p>you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you</p>\n<p>just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you</p>\n<p>would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had</p>\n<p>precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to</p>\n<p>convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an</p>\n<p>elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate</p>\n<p>formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he</p>",
        "<p>introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his</p>\n<p>words with care.</p>\n<p>Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler</p>\n<p>hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him</p>\n<p>on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of</p>\n<p>us in turn.</p>\n<p>“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me.</p>",
        "<p>“Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”</p>\n<p>When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure</p>\n<p>her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid</p>\n<p>and corpulent person in his middle years.</p>\n<p>“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”</p>\n<p>“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”</p>\n<p>“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”</p>",
        "<p>“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile.</p>\n<p>“Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”</p>\n<p>A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next</p>\n<p>remark it faded away.</p>\n<p>“However, I don’t believe it.”</p>\n<p>“Why not?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”</p>",
        "<p>Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he</p>\n<p>killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would</p>\n<p>have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from</p>\n<p>the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That</p>\n<p>was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial</p>\n<p>inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and</p>\n<p>buy a palace on Long Island Sound.</p>",
        "<p>“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject</p>\n<p>with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties.</p>\n<p>They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”</p>\n<p>There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra</p>\n<p>leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.</p>\n<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are</p>\n<p>going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which</p>",
        "<p>attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the</p>\n<p>papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial</p>\n<p>condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody</p>\n<p>laughed.</p>\n<p>“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s</p>\n<p>Jazz History of the World!’ ”</p>\n<p>The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it</p>",
        "<p>began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and</p>\n<p>looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin</p>\n<p>was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as</p>\n<p>though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about</p>\n<p>him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him</p>\n<p>off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as</p>\n<p>the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World”</p>",
        "<p>was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a</p>\n<p>puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into</p>\n<p>men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their</p>\n<p>falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s</p>\n<p>head for one link.</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon.”</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.</p>\n<p>“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would</p>\n<p>like to speak to you alone.”</p>\n<p>“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.</p>\n<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>\n<p>She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and</p>\n<p>followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her</p>",
        "<p>evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a</p>\n<p>jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk</p>\n<p>upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.</p>\n<p>I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and</p>\n<p>intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which</p>\n<p>overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now</p>\n<p>engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who</p>",
        "<p>implored me to join him, I went inside.</p>\n<p>The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was</p>\n<p>playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady</p>\n<p>from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of</p>\n<p>champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,</p>\n<p>that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was</p>\n<p>weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with</p>",
        "<p>gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering</p>\n<p>soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for</p>\n<p>when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they</p>\n<p>assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow</p>\n<p>black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes</p>\n<p>on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and</p>\n<p>went off into a deep vinous sleep.</p>",
        "<p>“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a</p>\n<p>girl at my elbow.</p>\n<p>I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights</p>\n<p>with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet</p>\n<p>from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was</p>\n<p>talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after</p>\n<p>attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent</p>",
        "<p>way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals</p>\n<p>she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:</p>\n<p>“You promised!” into his ear.</p>\n<p>The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall</p>\n<p>was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly</p>\n<p>indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in</p>\n<p>slightly raised voices.</p>",
        "<p>“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”</p>\n<p>“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”</p>\n<p>“We’re always the first ones to leave.”</p>\n<p>“So are we.”</p>\n<p>“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly.</p>\n<p>“The orchestra left half an hour ago.”</p>\n<p>In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond</p>",
        "<p>credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives</p>\n<p>were lifted, kicking, into the night.</p>\n<p>As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and</p>\n<p>Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last</p>\n<p>word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into</p>\n<p>formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.</p>\n<p>Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she</p>",
        "<p>lingered for a moment to shake hands.</p>\n<p>“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How long</p>\n<p>were we in there?”</p>\n<p>“Why, about an hour.”</p>\n<p>“It was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I</p>\n<p>wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully</p>\n<p>in my face. “Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She was hurrying off as she</p>\n<p>talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her</p>\n<p>party at the door.</p>\n<p>Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I</p>\n<p>joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I</p>\n<p>wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to</p>\n<p>apologize for not having known him in the garden.</p>",
        "<p>“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another</p>\n<p>thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity</p>\n<p>than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t</p>\n<p>forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine</p>\n<p>o’clock.”</p>\n<p>Then the butler, behind his shoulder:</p>\n<p>“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”</p>",
        "<p>“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there … Good night.”</p>\n<p>“Good night.”</p>\n<p>“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant</p>\n<p>significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired</p>\n<p>it all the time. “Good night, old sport … Good night.”</p>\n<p>But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite</p>\n<p>over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a</p>",
        "<p>bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side</p>\n<p>up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had</p>\n<p>left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall</p>\n<p>accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting</p>\n<p>considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,</p>\n<p>as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din</p>\n<p>from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to</p>",
        "<p>the already violent confusion of the scene.</p>\n<p>A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in</p>\n<p>the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the</p>\n<p>tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.</p>\n<p>“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”</p>\n<p>The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the</p>\n<p>unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby’s library.</p>\n<p>“How’d it happen?”</p>\n<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>\n<p>“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.</p>\n<p>“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole</p>\n<p>matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It</p>",
        "<p>happened, and that’s all I know.”</p>\n<p>“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”</p>\n<p>“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even</p>\n<p>trying.”</p>\n<p>An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.</p>\n<p>“Do you want to commit suicide?”</p>\n<p>“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”</p>",
        "<p>“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving.</p>\n<p>There’s another man in the car.”</p>\n<p>The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained</p>\n<p>“Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was</p>\n<p>now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened</p>\n<p>wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a</p>\n<p>pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively</p>",
        "<p>at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.</p>\n<p>Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant</p>\n<p>groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment</p>\n<p>before he perceived the man in the duster.</p>\n<p>“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”</p>\n<p>“Look!”</p>\n<p>Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it</p>",
        "<p>for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it</p>\n<p>had dropped from the sky.</p>\n<p>“It came off,” someone explained.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”</p>\n<p>A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,</p>\n<p>he remarked in a determined voice:</p>",
        "<p>“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”</p>\n<p>At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,</p>\n<p>explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any</p>\n<p>physical bond.</p>\n<p>“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”</p>\n<p>“But the wheel’s off!”</p>\n<p>He hesitated.</p>",
        "<p>“No harm in trying,” he said.</p>\n<p>The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and</p>\n<p>cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a</p>\n<p>moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before,</p>\n<p>and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.</p>\n<p>A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great</p>\n<p>doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who</p>",
        "<p>stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.</p>\n<p>Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the</p>\n<p>impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were</p>\n<p>all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events</p>\n<p>in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me</p>\n<p>infinitely less than my personal affairs.</p>\n<p>Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my</p>",
        "<p>shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York</p>\n<p>to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen</p>\n<p>by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded</p>\n<p>restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I</p>\n<p>even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and</p>\n<p>worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing</p>\n<p>mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I</p>",
        "<p>let it blow quietly away.</p>\n<p>I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the</p>\n<p>gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and</p>\n<p>studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There</p>\n<p>were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the</p>\n<p>library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was</p>\n<p>mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,</p>",
        "<p>and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.</p>\n<p>I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,</p>\n<p>and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and</p>\n<p>machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue</p>\n<p>and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few</p>\n<p>minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever</p>\n<p>know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their</p>",
        "<p>apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and</p>\n<p>smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm</p>\n<p>darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting</p>\n<p>loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who</p>\n<p>loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary</p>\n<p>restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant</p>\n<p>moments of night and life.</p>",
        "<p>Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined</p>\n<p>five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I</p>\n<p>felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they</p>\n<p>waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,</p>\n<p>and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining</p>\n<p>that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate</p>\n<p>excitement, I wished them well.</p>",
        "<p>For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I</p>\n<p>found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,</p>\n<p>because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it</p>\n<p>was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of</p>\n<p>tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world</p>\n<p>concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,</p>\n<p>even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it</p>",
        "<p>was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a</p>\n<p>borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about</p>\n<p>it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me</p>\n<p>that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a</p>\n<p>row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved</p>\n<p>her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached</p>\n<p>the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his</p>",
        "<p>statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been</p>\n<p>mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.</p>\n<p>Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw</p>\n<p>that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence</p>\n<p>from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.</p>\n<p>She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this</p>\n<p>unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she</p>",
        "<p>was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to</p>\n<p>the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.</p>\n<p>It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you</p>\n<p>never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on</p>\n<p>that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving</p>\n<p>a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our</p>\n<p>fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.</p>",
        "<p>“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more</p>\n<p>careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”</p>\n<p>“I am careful.”</p>\n<p>“No, you’re not.”</p>\n<p>“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.</p>\n<p>“What’s that got to do with it?”</p>\n<p>“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an</p>",
        "<p>accident.”</p>\n<p>“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”</p>\n<p>“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s</p>\n<p>why I like you.”</p>\n<p>Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had</p>\n<p>deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved</p>\n<p>her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as</p>",
        "<p>brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself</p>\n<p>definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once</p>\n<p>a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was</p>\n<p>how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of</p>\n<p>perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague</p>\n<p>understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.</p>\n<p>Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and</p>",
        "<p>this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever</p>\n<p>known.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter IV</h3>\n<p>On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,</p>\n<p>the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled</p>\n<p>hilariously on his lawn.</p>\n<p>“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between</p>\n<p>his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found</p>\n<p>out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the</p>",
        "<p>devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there</p>\n<p>crystal glass.”</p>\n<p>Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of</p>\n<p>those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable</p>\n<p>now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect</p>\n<p>July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will</p>\n<p>give you a better impression than my generalities of those who</p>",
        "<p>accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of</p>\n<p>knowing nothing whatever about him.</p>\n<p>From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a</p>\n<p>man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who</p>\n<p>was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie</p>\n<p>Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a</p>\n<p>corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came</p>",
        "<p>near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and</p>\n<p>Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned</p>\n<p>cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.</p>\n<p>Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,</p>\n<p>in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the</p>\n<p>garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.</p>\n<p>R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the</p>",
        "<p>Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he</p>\n<p>went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that</p>\n<p>Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies</p>\n<p>came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice</p>\n<p>A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and</p>\n<p>Beluga’s girls.</p>\n<p>From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and</p>",
        "<p>Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who</p>\n<p>controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don</p>\n<p>S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the</p>\n<p>movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.</p>\n<p>Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his</p>\n<p>wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.</p>\n<p>(“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to</p>",
        "<p>gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was</p>\n<p>cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably</p>\n<p>next day.</p>\n<p>A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as</p>\n<p>“the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people</p>\n<p>there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George</p>\n<p>Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the</p>",
        "<p>Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and</p>\n<p>the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the</p>\n<p>Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who</p>\n<p>killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.</p>\n<p>Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite</p>\n<p>the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with</p>\n<p>another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have</p>",
        "<p>forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria</p>\n<p>or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names</p>\n<p>of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American</p>\n<p>capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves</p>\n<p>to be.</p>\n<p>In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came</p>\n<p>there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had</p>",
        "<p>his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,</p>\n<p>his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of</p>\n<p>the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be</p>\n<p>her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and</p>\n<p>whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.</p>\n<p>All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.</p>\n<p>At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car</p>",
        "<p>lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody</p>\n<p>from its three-noted horn.</p>\n<p>It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of</p>\n<p>his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,</p>\n<p>made frequent use of his beach.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I</p>\n<p>thought we’d ride up together.”</p>",
        "<p>He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that</p>\n<p>resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,</p>\n<p>I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,</p>\n<p>with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality</p>\n<p>was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape</p>\n<p>of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping</p>\n<p>foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.</p>",
        "<p>He saw me looking with admiration at his car.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better</p>\n<p>view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”</p>\n<p>I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright</p>\n<p>with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with</p>\n<p>triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with</p>\n<p>a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down</p>",
        "<p>behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,</p>\n<p>we started to town.</p>\n<p>I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and</p>\n<p>found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first</p>\n<p>impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had</p>\n<p>gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an</p>\n<p>elaborate roadhouse next door.</p>",
        "<p>And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg</p>\n<p>village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished</p>\n<p>and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured</p>\n<p>suit.</p>\n<p>“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your</p>\n<p>opinion of me, anyhow?”</p>\n<p>A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that</p>",
        "<p>question deserves.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you</p>\n<p>hear.”</p>\n<p>So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation</p>\n<p>in his halls.</p>\n<p>“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine</p>",
        "<p>retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the</p>\n<p>Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at</p>\n<p>Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many</p>\n<p>years. It is a family tradition.”</p>\n<p>He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he</p>\n<p>was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed</p>\n<p>it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with</p>",
        "<p>this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if</p>\n<p>there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.</p>\n<p>“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.</p>\n<p>“San Francisco.”</p>\n<p>“I see.”</p>\n<p>“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”</p>\n<p>His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a</p>",
        "<p>clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling</p>\n<p>my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.</p>\n<p>“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of</p>\n<p>Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting</p>\n<p>big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to</p>\n<p>forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”</p>\n<p>With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very</p>",
        "<p>phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that</p>\n<p>of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued</p>\n<p>a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.</p>\n<p>“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very</p>\n<p>hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a</p>\n<p>commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I</p>\n<p>took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there</p>",
        "<p>was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t</p>\n<p>advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty</p>\n<p>men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last</p>\n<p>they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of</p>\n<p>dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave</p>\n<p>me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the</p>\n<p>Adriatic Sea!”</p>",
        "<p>Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his</p>\n<p>smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and</p>\n<p>sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It</p>\n<p>appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had</p>\n<p>elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My</p>\n<p>incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming</p>\n<p>hastily through a dozen magazines.</p>",
        "<p>He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,</p>\n<p>fell into my palm.</p>\n<p>“That’s the one from Montenegro.”</p>\n<p>To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di</p>\n<p>Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”</p>\n<p>“Turn it.”</p>\n<p>“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”</p>",
        "<p>“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It</p>\n<p>was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of</p>\n<p>Doncaster.”</p>\n<p>It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an</p>\n<p>archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,</p>\n<p>looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.</p>\n<p>Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace</p>",
        "<p>on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with</p>\n<p>their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his</p>\n<p>souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something</p>\n<p>about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,</p>\n<p>I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there</p>\n<p>trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated.</p>",
        "<p>“You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”</p>\n<p>“At lunch?”</p>\n<p>“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss</p>\n<p>Baker to tea.”</p>\n<p>“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”</p>\n<p>“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak</p>\n<p>to you about this matter.”</p>",
        "<p>I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more</p>\n<p>annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to</p>\n<p>discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something</p>\n<p>utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon</p>\n<p>his overpopulated lawn.</p>\n<p>He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared</p>\n<p>the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of</p>",
        "<p>red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with</p>\n<p>the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.</p>\n<p>Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a</p>\n<p>glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting</p>\n<p>vitality as we went by.</p>\n<p>With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half</p>\n<p>Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated</p>",
        "<p>I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic</p>\n<p>policeman rode alongside.</p>\n<p>“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white</p>\n<p>card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.</p>\n<p>“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next</p>\n<p>time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”</p>",
        "<p>“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a</p>\n<p>Christmas card every year.”</p>\n<p>Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a</p>\n<p>constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across</p>\n<p>the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of</p>\n<p>nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always</p>\n<p>the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the</p>",
        "<p>mystery and the beauty in the world.</p>\n<p>A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two</p>\n<p>carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for</p>\n<p>friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short</p>\n<p>upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we</p>\n<p>crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white</p>",
        "<p>chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I</p>\n<p>laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in</p>\n<p>haughty rivalry.</p>\n<p>“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought;</p>\n<p>“anything at all …”</p>\n<p>Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.</p>\n<p>Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby</p>",
        "<p>for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes</p>\n<p>picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”</p>\n<p>A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two</p>\n<p>fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a</p>\n<p>moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.</p>\n<p>“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand</p>",
        "<p>earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”</p>\n<p>“What?” I inquired politely.</p>\n<p>But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and</p>\n<p>covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.</p>\n<p>“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,</p>\n<p>don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and</p>\n<p>there.”</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the</p>\n<p>restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was</p>\n<p>starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.</p>\n<p>“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.</p>\n<p>“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the</p>\n<p>presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street</p>\n<p>better!”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too</p>\n<p>hot over there.”</p>\n<p>“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”</p>\n<p>“What place is that?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“The old Metropole.”</p>\n<p>“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with</p>\n<p>faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t</p>",
        "<p>forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It</p>\n<p>was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all</p>\n<p>evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a</p>\n<p>funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All</p>\n<p>right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his</p>\n<p>chair.</p>\n<p>“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t</p>",
        "<p>you, so help me, move outside this room.’</p>\n<p>“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the</p>\n<p>blinds we’d of seen daylight.”</p>\n<p>“Did he go?” I asked innocently.</p>\n<p>“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He</p>\n<p>turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away</p>\n<p>my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three</p>",
        "<p>times in his full belly and drove away.”</p>\n<p>“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.</p>\n<p>“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.</p>\n<p>“I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”</p>\n<p>The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered</p>\n<p>for me:</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”</p>",
        "<p>“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.</p>\n<p>“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other</p>\n<p>time.”</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”</p>\n<p>A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more</p>\n<p>sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with</p>\n<p>ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around</p>",
        "<p>the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people</p>\n<p>directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have</p>\n<p>taken one short glance beneath our own table.</p>\n<p>“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I</p>\n<p>made you a little angry this morning in the car.”</p>\n<p>There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you</p>",
        "<p>won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got</p>\n<p>to come through Miss Baker?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great</p>\n<p>sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all</p>\n<p>right.”</p>\n<p>Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,</p>\n<p>leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.</p>",
        "<p>“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his</p>\n<p>eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect</p>\n<p>gentleman.”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“He’s an Oggsford man.”</p>\n<p>“Oh!”</p>\n<p>“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”</p>",
        "<p>“I’ve heard of it.”</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”</p>\n<p>“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure</p>\n<p>of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a</p>\n<p>man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to</p>\n<p>myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce</p>",
        "<p>to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my</p>\n<p>cuff buttons.”</p>\n<p>I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of</p>\n<p>oddly familiar pieces of ivory.</p>\n<p>“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.</p>\n<p>“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very</p>",
        "<p>careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s</p>\n<p>wife.”</p>\n<p>When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and</p>\n<p>sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his</p>\n<p>feet.</p>\n<p>“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you</p>\n<p>two young men before I outstay my welcome.”</p>",
        "<p>“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem</p>\n<p>raised his hand in a sort of benediction.</p>\n<p>“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced</p>\n<p>solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies</p>\n<p>and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his</p>\n<p>hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on</p>\n<p>you any longer.”</p>",
        "<p>As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I</p>\n<p>wondered if I had said anything to offend him.</p>\n<p>“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is</p>\n<p>one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a</p>\n<p>denizen of Broadway.”</p>\n<p>“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>",
        "<p>“A dentist?”</p>\n<p>“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added,</p>\n<p>coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”</p>\n<p>“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.</p>\n<p>The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s</p>\n<p>Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I</p>\n<p>would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of</p>",
        "<p>some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could</p>\n<p>start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the</p>\n<p>single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.</p>\n<p>“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.</p>\n<p>“He just saw the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>“Why isn’t he in jail?”</p>\n<p>“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”</p>",
        "<p>I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I</p>\n<p>caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.</p>\n<p>“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to</p>\n<p>someone.”</p>\n<p>When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our</p>\n<p>direction.</p>\n<p>“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you</p>",
        "<p>haven’t called up.”</p>\n<p>“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”</p>\n<p>They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of</p>\n<p>embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.</p>\n<p>“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to</p>\n<p>come up this far to eat?”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”</p>",
        "<p>I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.</p>\n<p>One October day in nineteen-seventeen—</p>\n<p>(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a</p>\n<p>straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)</p>\n<p>—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks</p>\n<p>and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on</p>\n<p>shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the</p>",
        "<p>soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the</p>\n<p>wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in</p>\n<p>front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,</p>\n<p>in a disapproving way.</p>\n<p>The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to</p>\n<p>Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and</p>\n<p>by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She</p>",
        "<p>dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long</p>\n<p>the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp</p>\n<p>Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that</p>\n<p>night. “Anyways, for an hour!”</p>\n<p>When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was</p>\n<p>beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had</p>\n<p>never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she</p>",
        "<p>didn’t see me until I was five feet away.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”</p>\n<p>I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the</p>\n<p>older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red</p>\n<p>Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she</p>\n<p>couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was</p>\n<p>speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at</p>",
        "<p>sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the</p>\n<p>incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on</p>\n<p>him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I</p>\n<p>didn’t realize it was the same man.</p>\n<p>That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux</p>\n<p>myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very</p>\n<p>often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone</p>",
        "<p>at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had</p>\n<p>found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say</p>\n<p>goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually</p>\n<p>prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for</p>\n<p>several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any</p>\n<p>more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,</p>\n<p>who couldn’t get into the army at all.</p>",
        "<p>By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début</p>\n<p>after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a</p>\n<p>man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,</p>\n<p>with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He</p>\n<p>came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a</p>\n<p>whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he</p>\n<p>gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand</p>",
        "<p>dollars.</p>\n<p>I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the</p>\n<p>bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June</p>\n<p>night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle</p>\n<p>of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.</p>\n<p>“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how</p>\n<p>I do enjoy it.”</p>",
        "<p>“What’s the matter, Daisy?”</p>\n<p>I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.</p>\n<p>“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her</p>\n<p>on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs</p>\n<p>and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s</p>\n<p>change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”</p>\n<p>She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her</p>",
        "<p>mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.</p>\n<p>She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her</p>\n<p>and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the</p>\n<p>soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.</p>\n<p>But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and</p>\n<p>put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half</p>\n<p>an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around</p>",
        "<p>her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she</p>\n<p>married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a</p>\n<p>three months’ trip to the South Seas.</p>\n<p>I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d</p>\n<p>never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a</p>\n<p>minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and</p>\n<p>wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the</p>",
        "<p>door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the</p>\n<p>hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with</p>\n<p>unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you</p>\n<p>laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I</p>\n<p>left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,</p>\n<p>and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got</p>\n<p>into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the</p>",
        "<p>chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.</p>\n<p>The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for</p>\n<p>a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and</p>\n<p>then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in</p>\n<p>Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young</p>\n<p>and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect</p>\n<p>reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage</p>",
        "<p>not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,</p>\n<p>moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that</p>\n<p>everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy</p>\n<p>never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice</p>\n<p>of hers …</p>\n<p>Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first</p>\n<p>time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and</p>\n<p>woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was</p>\n<p>half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man</p>\n<p>she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby</p>\n<p>with the officer in her white car.</p>\n<p>When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza</p>\n<p>for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.</p>",
        "<p>The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in</p>\n<p>the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered</p>\n<p>like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:</p>\n<p>“I’m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when</p>\n<p>you’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”</p>\n<p>“It was a strange coincidence,” I said.</p>\n<p>“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”</p>",
        "<p>“Why not?”</p>\n<p>“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.”</p>\n<p>Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that</p>\n<p>June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of</p>\n<p>his purposeless splendour.</p>\n<p>“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your</p>\n<p>house some afternoon and then let him come over.”</p>",
        "<p>The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and</p>\n<p>bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that</p>\n<p>he could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.</p>\n<p>“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”</p>\n<p>“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might be</p>\n<p>offended. You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all.”</p>\n<p>Something worried me.</p>",
        "<p>“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”</p>\n<p>“He wants her to see his house,” she explained. “And your house is</p>\n<p>right next door.”</p>\n<p>“Oh!”</p>\n<p>“I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some</p>\n<p>night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking</p>\n<p>people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It</p>",
        "<p>was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard</p>\n<p>the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately</p>\n<p>suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:</p>\n<p>“ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying. ‘I</p>\n<p>want to see her right next door.’</p>\n<p>“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to</p>\n<p>abandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he</p>",
        "<p>says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of</p>\n<p>catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”</p>\n<p>It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm</p>\n<p>around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her</p>\n<p>to dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,</p>\n<p>but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal</p>\n<p>scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my</p>",
        "<p>arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady</p>\n<p>excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and</p>\n<p>the tired.”</p>\n<p>“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to</p>\n<p>me.</p>\n<p>“Does she want to see Gatsby?”</p>\n<p>“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re</p>",
        "<p>just supposed to invite her to tea.”</p>\n<p>We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth</p>\n<p>Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.</p>\n<p>Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face</p>\n<p>floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up</p>\n<p>the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth</p>\n<p>smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter V</h3>\n<p>When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that</p>\n<p>my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the</p>\n<p>peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery</p>\n<p>and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a</p>\n<p>corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.</p>\n<p>At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved</p>",
        "<p>itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the</p>\n<p>house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in</p>\n<p>the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on</p>\n<p>again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned</p>\n<p>away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.</p>\n<p>“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been</p>",
        "<p>glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old</p>\n<p>sport. In my car.”</p>\n<p>“It’s too late.”</p>\n<p>“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made</p>\n<p>use of it all summer.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to go to bed.”</p>\n<p>“All right.”</p>",
        "<p>He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.</p>\n<p>“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call</p>\n<p>up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you</p>\n<p>to any trouble.”</p>\n<p>“What day would suit you?”</p>\n<p>“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to</p>",
        "<p>put you to any trouble, you see.”</p>\n<p>“How about the day after tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the</p>\n<p>grass cut,” he said.</p>\n<p>We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my</p>\n<p>ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I</p>\n<p>suspected that he meant my grass.</p>",
        "<p>“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.</p>\n<p>“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of</p>\n<p>beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make</p>\n<p>much money, do you?”</p>\n<p>“Not very much.”</p>\n<p>This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.</p>",
        "<p>“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a</p>\n<p>little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And</p>\n<p>I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds,</p>\n<p>aren’t you, old sport?”</p>\n<p>“Trying to.”</p>\n<p>“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time</p>\n<p>and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather</p>",
        "<p>confidential sort of thing.”</p>\n<p>I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation</p>\n<p>might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer</p>\n<p>was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no</p>\n<p>choice except to cut him off there.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t</p>\n<p>take on any more work.”</p>",
        "<p>“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he</p>\n<p>thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at</p>\n<p>lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,</p>\n<p>hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be</p>\n<p>responsive, so he went unwillingly home.</p>\n<p>The evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a</p>\n<p>deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into</p>\n<p>rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the</p>\n<p>office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.</p>\n<p>“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.</p>\n<p>“What?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bring Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.</p>",
        "<p>The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock a man in a</p>\n<p>raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that</p>\n<p>Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I</p>\n<p>had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg</p>\n<p>Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy</p>\n<p>some cups and lemons and flowers.</p>\n<p>The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived</p>",
        "<p>from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour</p>\n<p>later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel</p>\n<p>suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale,</p>\n<p>and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.</p>\n<p>“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.</p>\n<p>“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”</p>\n<p>“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He</p>",
        "<p>looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t</p>\n<p>believe he saw a thing.</p>\n<p>“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they</p>\n<p>thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The</p>\n<p>Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”</p>\n<p>I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at</p>\n<p>the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the</p>",
        "<p>delicatessen shop.</p>\n<p>“Will they do?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old</p>\n<p>sport.”</p>\n<p>The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which</p>\n<p>occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes</p>\n<p>through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that</p>",
        "<p>shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from</p>\n<p>time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were</p>\n<p>taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an</p>\n<p>uncertain voice, that he was going home.</p>\n<p>“Why’s that?”</p>\n<p>“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if</p>\n<p>there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait</p>",
        "<p>all day.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”</p>\n<p>He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously</p>\n<p>there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped</p>\n<p>up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.</p>\n<p>Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the</p>\n<p>drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a</p>",
        "<p>three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic</p>\n<p>smile.</p>\n<p>“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”</p>\n<p>The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I</p>\n<p>had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear</p>\n<p>alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a</p>\n<p>dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with</p>",
        "<p>glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.</p>\n<p>“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have</p>\n<p>to come alone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far</p>\n<p>away and spend an hour.”</p>\n<p>“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is</p>\n<p>Ferdie.”</p>",
        "<p>“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”</p>\n<p>We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.</p>\n<p>“What’s funny?”</p>\n<p>She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the</p>\n<p>front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his</p>",
        "<p>hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a</p>\n<p>puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.</p>\n<p>With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the</p>\n<p>hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the</p>\n<p>living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my</p>\n<p>own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.</p>\n<p>For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I</p>",
        "<p>heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by</p>\n<p>Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:</p>\n<p>“I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”</p>\n<p>A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I</p>\n<p>went into the room.</p>\n<p>Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the</p>\n<p>mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of</p>",
        "<p>boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face</p>\n<p>of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught</p>\n<p>eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful,</p>\n<p>on the edge of a stiff chair.</p>\n<p>“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at</p>\n<p>me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily</p>\n<p>the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his</p>",
        "<p>head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and</p>\n<p>set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm</p>\n<p>of the sofa and his chin in his hand.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.</p>\n<p>My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up</p>\n<p>a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.</p>\n<p>“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.</p>",
        "<p>I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on</p>\n<p>the floor.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as</p>\n<p>matter-of-fact as it could ever be.</p>\n<p>“Five years next November.”</p>\n<p>The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least</p>\n<p>another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate</p>",
        "<p>suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac</p>\n<p>Finn brought it in on a tray.</p>\n<p>Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical</p>\n<p>decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,</p>\n<p>while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other</p>\n<p>of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in</p>\n<p>itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my</p>",
        "<p>feet.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be back.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”</p>\n<p>He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and</p>\n<p>whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.</p>\n<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>",
        "<p>“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to</p>\n<p>side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”</p>\n<p>“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s</p>\n<p>embarrassed too.”</p>\n<p>“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.</p>\n<p>“Just as much as you are.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t talk so loud.”</p>",
        "<p>“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only</p>\n<p>that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”</p>\n<p>He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable</p>\n<p>reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his</p>\n<p>nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge</p>",
        "<p>black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the</p>\n<p>rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric</p>\n<p>marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church</p>\n<p>steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period”</p>\n<p>craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay</p>",
        "<p>five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would</p>\n<p>have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the</p>\n<p>heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate</p>\n<p>decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on</p>\n<p>the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have</p>\n<p>always been obstinate about being peasantry.</p>\n<p>After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile</p>",
        "<p>rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’</p>\n<p>dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening</p>\n<p>the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,</p>\n<p>leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the</p>\n<p>garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had</p>\n<p>seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little</p>\n<p>now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that</p>",
        "<p>silence had fallen within the house too.</p>\n<p>I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of</p>\n<p>pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They</p>\n<p>were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if</p>\n<p>some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of</p>\n<p>embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when</p>\n<p>I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief</p>",
        "<p>before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply</p>\n<p>confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of</p>\n<p>exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I</p>\n<p>thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.</p>\n<p>“It’s stopped raining.”</p>",
        "<p>“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were</p>\n<p>twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,</p>\n<p>like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to</p>\n<p>Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”</p>\n<p>“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told</p>\n<p>only of her unexpected joy.</p>\n<p>“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to</p>",
        "<p>show her around.”</p>\n<p>“You’re sure you want me to come?”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely, old sport.”</p>\n<p>Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with</p>\n<p>humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.</p>\n<p>“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole</p>\n<p>front of it catches the light.”</p>",
        "<p>I agreed that it was splendid.</p>\n<p>“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It</p>\n<p>took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”</p>\n<p>“I thought you inherited your money.”</p>\n<p>“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in</p>\n<p>the big panic—the panic of the war.”</p>\n<p>I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what</p>",
        "<p>business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized</p>\n<p>that it wasn’t an appropriate reply.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the</p>\n<p>drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in</p>\n<p>either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean</p>\n<p>you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”</p>\n<p>Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of</p>",
        "<p>brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.</p>\n<p>“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.</p>\n<p>“Do you like it?”</p>\n<p>“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”</p>\n<p>“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People</p>\n<p>who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”</p>\n<p>Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the</p>",
        "<p>road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy</p>\n<p>admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,</p>\n<p>admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy</p>\n<p>odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of</p>\n<p>kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find</p>\n<p>no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but</p>\n<p>bird voices in the trees.</p>",
        "<p>And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and</p>\n<p>Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind</p>\n<p>every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we</p>\n<p>had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College</p>\n<p>Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into</p>\n<p>ghostly laughter.</p>\n<p>We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender</p>",
        "<p>silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,</p>\n<p>and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a</p>\n<p>dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It</p>\n<p>was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily</p>\n<p>about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own</p>\n<p>apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat</p>\n<p>down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in</p>",
        "<p>the wall.</p>\n<p>He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued</p>\n<p>everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew</p>\n<p>from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his</p>\n<p>possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding</p>\n<p>presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a</p>\n<p>flight of stairs.</p>",
        "<p>His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was</p>\n<p>garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush</p>\n<p>with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and</p>\n<p>shaded his eyes and began to laugh.</p>\n<p>“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I</p>\n<p>can’t—When I try to—”</p>\n<p>He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a</p>",
        "<p>third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed</p>\n<p>with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,</p>\n<p>dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to</p>\n<p>speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,</p>\n<p>he was running down like an over-wound clock.</p>\n<p>Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent</p>\n<p>cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and</p>",
        "<p>his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a</p>\n<p>selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”</p>\n<p>He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,</p>\n<p>before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,</p>\n<p>which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in</p>\n<p>many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft</p>",
        "<p>rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in</p>\n<p>coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of</p>\n<p>indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into</p>\n<p>the shirts and began to cry stormily.</p>\n<p>“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the</p>\n<p>thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such</p>\n<p>beautiful shirts before.”</p>",
        "<p>After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and</p>\n<p>the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window</p>\n<p>it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated</p>\n<p>surface of the Sound.</p>\n<p>“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,”</p>\n<p>said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at</p>\n<p>the end of your dock.”</p>",
        "<p>Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what</p>\n<p>he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal</p>\n<p>significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the</p>\n<p>great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very</p>\n<p>near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to</p>\n<p>the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of</p>\n<p>enchanted objects had diminished by one.</p>",
        "<p>I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects</p>\n<p>in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting</p>\n<p>costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.</p>\n<p>“Who’s this?”</p>\n<p>“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”</p>\n<p>The name sounded faintly familiar.</p>\n<p>“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”</p>",
        "<p>There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the</p>\n<p>bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently</p>\n<p>when he was about eighteen.</p>\n<p>“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you</p>\n<p>had a pompadour—or a yacht.”</p>\n<p>“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about</p>\n<p>you.”</p>",
        "<p>They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the</p>\n<p>rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.</p>\n<p>“Yes … Well, I can’t talk now … I can’t talk now, old sport … I said a</p>\n<p>small town … He must know what a small town is … Well, he’s no use to</p>\n<p>us if Detroit is his idea of a small town …”</p>\n<p>He rang off.</p>\n<p>“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.</p>",
        "<p>The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,</p>\n<p>and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.</p>\n<p>“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to</p>\n<p>just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you</p>\n<p>around.”</p>\n<p>I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence</p>\n<p>made them feel more satisfactorily alone.</p>",
        "<p>“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the</p>\n<p>piano.”</p>\n<p>He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes</p>\n<p>accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with</p>\n<p>shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently</p>\n<p>clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck</p>\n<p>trousers of a nebulous hue.</p>",
        "<p>“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.</p>\n<p>“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.</p>\n<p>“That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up …”</p>\n<p>“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t</p>\n<p>you, Ewing, old sport?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”</p>\n<p>“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The</p>",
        "<p>grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.</p>\n<p>In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.</p>\n<p>He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her</p>\n<p>on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the</p>\n<p>gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.</p>\n<p>When Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the</p>\n<p>bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.</p>",
        "<p>“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all</p>\n<p>out of prac—”</p>\n<p>“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”</p>\n<p>“In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”</p>\n<p>Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along</p>\n<p>the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric</p>\n<p>trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New</p>",
        "<p>York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was</p>\n<p>generating on the air.</p>\n<p>“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the</p>\n<p>poor get—children. In the meantime, In between time—”</p>\n<p>As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of</p>\n<p>bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt</p>\n<p>had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost</p>",
        "<p>five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when</p>\n<p>Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but</p>\n<p>because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond</p>\n<p>her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative</p>\n<p>passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright</p>\n<p>feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can</p>\n<p>challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.</p>",
        "<p>As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took</p>\n<p>hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned</p>\n<p>toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most,</p>\n<p>with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be</p>\n<p>over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.</p>\n<p>They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;</p>\n<p>Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they</p>",
        "<p>looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went</p>\n<p>out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them</p>\n<p>there together.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter VI</h3>\n<p>About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one</p>\n<p>morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.</p>\n<p>“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.</p>\n<p>“Why—any statement to give out.”</p>\n<p>It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either</p>",
        "<p>wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. This was his day off and</p>\n<p>with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”</p>\n<p>It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right.</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his</p>\n<p>hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all</p>\n<p>summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends</p>\n<p>such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to</p>",
        "<p>him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house</p>\n<p>at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly</p>\n<p>up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a</p>\n<p>source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to</p>\n<p>say.</p>\n<p>James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had</p>\n<p>changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that</p>",
        "<p>witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht</p>\n<p>drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was</p>\n<p>James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a</p>\n<p>torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay</p>\n<p>Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and</p>\n<p>informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an</p>\n<p>hour.</p>",
        "<p>I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. His</p>\n<p>parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination</p>\n<p>had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was</p>\n<p>that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic</p>\n<p>conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means</p>\n<p>anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business,</p>\n<p>the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented</p>",
        "<p>just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be</p>\n<p>likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.</p>\n<p>For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of</p>\n<p>Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other</p>\n<p>capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body</p>\n<p>lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing</p>\n<p>days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became</p>",
        "<p>contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of</p>\n<p>the others because they were hysterical about things which in his</p>\n<p>overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.</p>\n<p>But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque</p>\n<p>and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of</p>\n<p>ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock</p>\n<p>ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled</p>",
        "<p>clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his</p>\n<p>fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an</p>\n<p>oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for</p>\n<p>his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of</p>\n<p>reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on</p>\n<p>a fairy’s wing.</p>\n<p>An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,</p>",
        "<p>to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He</p>\n<p>stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the</p>\n<p>drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s</p>\n<p>work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to</p>\n<p>Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the</p>\n<p>day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.</p>\n<p>Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,</p>",
        "<p>of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The</p>\n<p>transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire</p>\n<p>found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,</p>\n<p>suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him</p>\n<p>from his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,</p>\n<p>the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and</p>\n<p>sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid</p>",
        "<p>journalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable</p>\n<p>shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in</p>\n<p>Little Girl Bay.</p>\n<p>To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,</p>\n<p>that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I</p>\n<p>suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked</p>\n<p>him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of</p>",
        "<p>them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and</p>\n<p>extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and</p>\n<p>bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a</p>\n<p>yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the</p>\n<p>Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too.</p>\n<p>He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with</p>\n<p>Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even</p>",
        "<p>jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk</p>\n<p>might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by</p>\n<p>reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five</p>\n<p>years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.</p>\n<p>It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye</p>\n<p>came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody</p>\n<p>inhospitably died.</p>",
        "<p>I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid</p>\n<p>man with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one</p>\n<p>phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage</p>\n<p>violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to</p>\n<p>Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay</p>\n<p>parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he</p>\n<p>formed the habit of letting liquor alone.</p>",
        "<p>And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five</p>\n<p>thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal</p>\n<p>device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions</p>\n<p>went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate</p>\n<p>education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the</p>\n<p>substantiality of a man.</p>\n<p>He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with</p>",
        "<p>the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents,</p>\n<p>which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time</p>\n<p>of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and</p>\n<p>nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while</p>\n<p>Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of</p>\n<p>misconceptions away.</p>\n<p>It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several</p>",
        "<p>weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in</p>\n<p>New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself</p>\n<p>with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday</p>\n<p>afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom</p>\n<p>Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really</p>\n<p>surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.</p>\n<p>They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and</p>",
        "<p>a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.</p>\n<p>“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m</p>\n<p>delighted that you dropped in.”</p>\n<p>As though they cared!</p>\n<p>“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the</p>\n<p>room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in</p>\n<p>just a minute.”</p>",
        "<p>He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he</p>\n<p>would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in</p>\n<p>a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted</p>\n<p>nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,</p>\n<p>thanks … I’m sorry—</p>\n<p>“Did you have a nice ride?”</p>\n<p>“Very good roads around here.”</p>",
        "<p>“I suppose the automobiles—”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.”</p>\n<p>Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had</p>\n<p>accepted the introduction as a stranger.</p>\n<p>“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering.</p>\n<p>“So we did. I remember very well.”</p>",
        "<p>“About two weeks ago.”</p>\n<p>“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”</p>\n<p>“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.</p>\n<p>“That so?”</p>\n<p>Tom turned to me.</p>\n<p>“You live near here, Nick?”</p>\n<p>“Next door.”</p>",
        "<p>“That so?”</p>\n<p>Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back</p>\n<p>haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until</p>\n<p>unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.</p>\n<p>“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested.</p>\n<p>“What do you say?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”</p>",
        "<p>“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought</p>\n<p>to be starting home.”</p>\n<p>“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself</p>\n<p>now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you</p>\n<p>stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped</p>\n<p>in from New York.”</p>\n<p>“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of</p>",
        "<p>you.”</p>\n<p>This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.</p>\n<p>“Come along,” he said—but to her only.</p>\n<p>“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”</p>\n<p>Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see</p>\n<p>that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.</p>",
        "<p>“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.</p>\n<p>Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.</p>\n<p>“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.</p>\n<p>“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but</p>\n<p>I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse</p>\n<p>me for just a minute.”</p>\n<p>The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady</p>",
        "<p>began an impassioned conversation aside.</p>\n<p>“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she</p>\n<p>doesn’t want him?”</p>\n<p>“She says she does want him.”</p>\n<p>“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He</p>\n<p>frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be</p>\n<p>old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to</p>",
        "<p>suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”</p>\n<p>Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted</p>\n<p>their horses.</p>\n<p>“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.”  And</p>\n<p>then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”</p>\n<p>Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they</p>\n<p>trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage</p>",
        "<p>just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the</p>\n<p>front door.</p>\n<p>Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on</p>\n<p>the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s</p>\n<p>party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of</p>\n<p>oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties</p>\n<p>that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of</p>",
        "<p>people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,</p>\n<p>many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a</p>\n<p>pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had</p>\n<p>merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete</p>\n<p>in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to</p>\n<p>nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was</p>\n<p>looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening</p>",
        "<p>to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your</p>\n<p>own powers of adjustment.</p>\n<p>They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling</p>\n<p>hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.</p>\n<p>“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me</p>\n<p>any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad</p>\n<p>to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.</p>",
        "<p>I’m giving out green—”</p>\n<p>“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”</p>\n<p>“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”</p>\n<p>Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.</p>\n<p>“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking</p>\n<p>I don’t know a soul here.”</p>",
        "<p>“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely</p>\n<p>human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom</p>\n<p>and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies</p>\n<p>the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.</p>\n<p>“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.</p>\n<p>“The man bending over her is her director.”</p>\n<p>He took them ceremoniously from group to group:</p>",
        "<p>“Mrs. Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he</p>\n<p>added: “the polo player.”</p>\n<p>“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”</p>\n<p>But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the</p>\n<p>polo player” for the rest of the evening.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that</p>\n<p>man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.</p>\n<p>“Well, I liked him anyhow.”</p>\n<p>“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,</p>\n<p>“I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”</p>\n<p>Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,</p>\n<p>conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they</p>\n<p>sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,</p>",
        "<p>while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case</p>\n<p>there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”</p>\n<p>Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper</p>\n<p>together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he</p>\n<p>said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”</p>\n<p>“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any</p>\n<p>addresses here’s my little gold pencil.” … She looked around after a</p>",
        "<p>moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that</p>\n<p>except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t</p>\n<p>having a good time.</p>\n<p>We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had</p>\n<p>been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two</p>\n<p>weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air</p>\n<p>now.</p>",
        "<p>“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”</p>\n<p>The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my</p>\n<p>shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.</p>\n<p>“Wha’?”</p>\n<p>A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf</p>\n<p>with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:</p>\n<p>“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she</p>",
        "<p>always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it</p>\n<p>alone.”</p>\n<p>“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.</p>\n<p>“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody</p>\n<p>that needs your help, Doc.’ ”</p>\n<p>“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without</p>\n<p>gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in</p>",
        "<p>the pool.”</p>\n<p>“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss</p>\n<p>Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”</p>\n<p>“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.</p>\n<p>“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand</p>\n<p>shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”</p>\n<p>It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with</p>",
        "<p>Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were</p>\n<p>still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except</p>\n<p>for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he</p>\n<p>had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this</p>\n<p>proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate</p>\n<p>degree and kiss at her cheek.</p>\n<p>“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”</p>",
        "<p>But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture</p>\n<p>but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented</p>\n<p>“place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing</p>\n<p>village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old</p>\n<p>euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants</p>\n<p>along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in</p>\n<p>the very simplicity she failed to understand.</p>",
        "<p>I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.</p>\n<p>It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet</p>\n<p>of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow</p>\n<p>moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,</p>\n<p>an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an</p>\n<p>invisible glass.</p>\n<p>“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big</p>",
        "<p>bootlegger?”</p>\n<p>“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are</p>\n<p>just big bootleggers, you know.”</p>\n<p>“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.</p>\n<p>He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under</p>\n<p>his feet.</p>",
        "<p>“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie</p>\n<p>together.”</p>\n<p>A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.</p>\n<p>“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said</p>\n<p>with an effort.</p>\n<p>“You didn’t look so interested.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I was.”</p>",
        "<p>Tom laughed and turned to me.</p>\n<p>“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under</p>\n<p>a cold shower?”</p>\n<p>Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,</p>\n<p>bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and</p>\n<p>would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up</p>\n<p>sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change</p>",
        "<p>tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.</p>\n<p>“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said</p>\n<p>suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way</p>\n<p>in and he’s too polite to object.”</p>\n<p>“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I</p>\n<p>think I’ll make a point of finding out.”</p>\n<p>“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a</p>",
        "<p>lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”</p>\n<p>The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.</p>\n<p>“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.</p>\n<p>Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where</p>\n<p>“Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year,</p>\n<p>was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from</p>",
        "<p>her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling</p>\n<p>her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?</p>\n<p>Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare</p>\n<p>and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with</p>\n<p>one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would</p>\n<p>blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.</p>\n<p>I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,</p>",
        "<p>and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had</p>\n<p>run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights</p>\n<p>were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the</p>\n<p>steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,</p>\n<p>and his eyes were bright and tired.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.</p>\n<p>“Of course she did.”</p>",
        "<p>“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”</p>\n<p>He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.</p>\n<p>“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her</p>\n<p>understand.”</p>\n<p>“You mean about the dance?”</p>\n<p>“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of</p>\n<p>his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”</p>",
        "<p>He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and</p>\n<p>say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with</p>\n<p>that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be</p>\n<p>taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back</p>\n<p>to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five</p>\n<p>years ago.</p>\n<p>“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to</p>",
        "<p>understand. We’d sit for hours—”</p>\n<p>He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit</p>\n<p>rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the</p>\n<p>past.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you</p>\n<p>can!”</p>",
        "<p>He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the</p>\n<p>shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said,</p>\n<p>nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”</p>\n<p>He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to</p>\n<p>recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into</p>\n<p>loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then,</p>",
        "<p>but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it</p>\n<p>all slowly, he could find out what that thing was …</p>\n<p>… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the</p>\n<p>street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where</p>\n<p>there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They</p>\n<p>stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night</p>\n<p>with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes</p>",
        "<p>of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the</p>\n<p>darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the</p>\n<p>corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really</p>\n<p>formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could</p>\n<p>climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the</p>\n<p>pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.</p>\n<p>His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He</p>",
        "<p>knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable</p>\n<p>visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like</p>\n<p>the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the</p>\n<p>tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At</p>\n<p>his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the</p>\n<p>incarnation was complete.</p>\n<p>Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was</p>",
        "<p>reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,</p>\n<p>that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase</p>\n<p>tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s,</p>\n<p>as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled</p>\n<p>air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was</p>\n<p>uncommunicable forever.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VII</h3>\n<p>It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights</p>\n<p>in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as</p>\n<p>it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I</p>\n<p>become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his</p>\n<p>drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering</p>\n<p>if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a</p>",
        "<p>villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.</p>\n<p>“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”</p>\n<p>“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.</p>\n<p>“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr.</p>\n<p>Carraway came over.”</p>\n<p>“Who?” he demanded rudely.</p>\n<p>“Carraway.”</p>",
        "<p>“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”</p>\n<p>Abruptly he slammed the door.</p>\n<p>My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his</p>\n<p>house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never</p>\n<p>went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered</p>\n<p>moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that</p>\n<p>the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the</p>",
        "<p>village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.</p>\n<p>Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.</p>\n<p>“Going away?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>“No, old sport.”</p>\n<p>“I hear you fired all your servants.”</p>\n<p>“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite</p>\n<p>often—in the afternoons.”</p>",
        "<p>So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the</p>\n<p>disapproval in her eyes.</p>\n<p>“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all</p>\n<p>brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”</p>\n<p>“I see.”</p>\n<p>He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her</p>\n<p>house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy</p>",
        "<p>herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was</p>\n<p>coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they would</p>\n<p>choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing</p>\n<p>scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.</p>\n<p>The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of</p>\n<p>the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only</p>\n<p>the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering</p>",
        "<p>hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of</p>\n<p>combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into</p>\n<p>her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her</p>\n<p>fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her</p>\n<p>pocketbook slapped to the floor.</p>\n<p>“Oh, my!” she gasped.</p>\n<p>I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it</p>",
        "<p>at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that</p>\n<p>I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,</p>\n<p>suspected me just the same.</p>\n<p>“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather! … Hot! …</p>\n<p>Hot! … Hot! … Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it … ?”</p>\n<p>My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.</p>\n<p>That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,</p>",
        "<p>whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!</p>\n<p>… Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying</p>\n<p>the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at</p>\n<p>the door.</p>\n<p>“The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’m</p>\n<p>sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this</p>\n<p>noon!”</p>",
        "<p>What he really said was: “Yes … Yes … I’ll see.”</p>\n<p>He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to</p>\n<p>take our stiff straw hats.</p>\n<p>“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the</p>\n<p>direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the</p>\n<p>common store of life.</p>\n<p>The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and</p>",
        "<p>Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down</p>\n<p>their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.</p>\n<p>“We can’t move,” they said together.</p>\n<p>Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment</p>\n<p>in mine.</p>\n<p>“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall</p>",
        "<p>telephone.</p>\n<p>Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with</p>\n<p>fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting</p>\n<p>laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.</p>\n<p>“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the</p>\n<p>telephone.”</p>\n<p>We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very</p>",
        "<p>well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all … I’m under no obligations</p>\n<p>to you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I</p>\n<p>won’t stand that at all!”</p>\n<p>“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.</p>\n<p>“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to</p>\n<p>know about it.”</p>\n<p>Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his</p>",
        "<p>thick body, and hurried into the room.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed</p>\n<p>dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir … Nick …”</p>\n<p>“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.</p>\n<p>As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and</p>\n<p>pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.</p>\n<p>“You know I love you,” she murmured.</p>",
        "<p>“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.</p>\n<p>Daisy looked around doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“You kiss Nick too.”</p>\n<p>“What a low, vulgar girl!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.</p>\n<p>Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just</p>\n<p>as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.</p>",
        "<p>“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your</p>\n<p>own mother that loves you.”</p>\n<p>The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and</p>\n<p>rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.</p>\n<p>“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy</p>\n<p>hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”</p>\n<p>Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.</p>",
        "<p>Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he</p>\n<p>had ever really believed in its existence before.</p>\n<p>“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to</p>\n<p>Daisy.</p>\n<p>“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent</p>\n<p>into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You</p>\n<p>absolute little dream.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress</p>\n<p>too.”</p>\n<p>“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that</p>\n<p>she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”</p>\n<p>“Where’s Daddy?”</p>\n<p>“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like</p>\n<p>me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”</p>",
        "<p>Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held</p>\n<p>out her hand.</p>\n<p>“Come, Pammy.”</p>\n<p>“Goodbye, sweetheart!”</p>\n<p>With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to</p>\n<p>her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,</p>\n<p>preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby took up his drink.</p>\n<p>“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.</p>\n<p>We drank in long, greedy swallows.</p>\n<p>“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom</p>\n<p>genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into</p>\n<p>the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting</p>\n<p>colder every year.</p>",
        "<p>“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look</p>\n<p>at the place.”</p>\n<p>I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in</p>\n<p>the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed</p>\n<p>across the bay.</p>\n<p>“I’m right across from you.”</p>",
        "<p>“So you are.”</p>\n<p>Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy</p>\n<p>refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat</p>\n<p>moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped</p>\n<p>ocean and the abounding blessed isles.</p>\n<p>“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there</p>\n<p>with him for about an hour.”</p>",
        "<p>We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and</p>\n<p>drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.</p>\n<p>“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the</p>\n<p>day after that, and the next thirty years?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it</p>\n<p>gets crisp in the fall.”</p>\n<p>“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and</p>",
        "<p>everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”</p>\n<p>Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding</p>\n<p>its senselessness into forms.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to</p>\n<p>Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a</p>\n<p>garage.”</p>\n<p>“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes</p>",
        "<p>floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”</p>\n<p>Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in</p>\n<p>space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.</p>\n<p>“You always look so cool,” she repeated.</p>\n<p>She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was</p>\n<p>astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and</p>\n<p>then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew</p>",
        "<p>a long time ago.</p>\n<p>“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.</p>\n<p>“You know the advertisement of the man—”</p>\n<p>“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to</p>\n<p>town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”</p>\n<p>He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one</p>\n<p>moved.</p>",
        "<p>“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow?</p>\n<p>If we’re going to town, let’s start.”</p>\n<p>His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips</p>\n<p>the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out</p>\n<p>on to the blazing gravel drive.</p>\n<p>“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going</p>\n<p>to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”</p>",
        "<p>“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”</p>\n<p>He didn’t answer.</p>\n<p>“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”</p>\n<p>They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there</p>\n<p>shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon</p>\n<p>hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed</p>",
        "<p>his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.</p>\n<p>“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.</p>\n<p>“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”</p>\n<p>“Oh.”</p>\n<p>A pause.</p>\n<p>“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.</p>\n<p>“Women get these notions in their heads—”</p>",
        "<p>“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.</p>\n<p>“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.</p>\n<p>Gatsby turned to me rigidly:</p>\n<p>“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”</p>\n<p>“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I</p>\n<p>hesitated.</p>\n<p>“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.</p>",
        "<p>That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that</p>\n<p>was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of</p>\n<p>it, the cymbals’ song of it … High in a white palace the king’s</p>\n<p>daughter, the golden girl …</p>\n<p>Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed</p>\n<p>by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and</p>\n<p>carrying light capes over their arms.</p>",
        "<p>“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green</p>\n<p>leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”</p>\n<p>“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”</p>\n<p>The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.</p>",
        "<p>“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “And</p>\n<p>if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a</p>\n<p>drugstore nowadays.”</p>\n<p>A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom</p>\n<p>frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar</p>\n<p>and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in</p>\n<p>words, passed over Gatsby’s face.</p>",
        "<p>“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s</p>\n<p>car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”</p>\n<p>He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.</p>\n<p>“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”</p>\n<p>She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan</p>\n<p>and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the</p>\n<p>unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive</p>",
        "<p>heat, leaving them out of sight behind.</p>\n<p>“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.</p>\n<p>“See what?”</p>\n<p>He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known</p>\n<p>all along.</p>\n<p>“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am,</p>\n<p>but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to</p>",
        "<p>do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”</p>\n<p>He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back</p>\n<p>from the edge of theoretical abyss.</p>\n<p>“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I</p>\n<p>could have gone deeper if I’d known—”</p>\n<p>“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.</p>\n<p>“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”</p>",
        "<p>“About Gatsby.”</p>\n<p>“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small</p>\n<p>investigation of his past.”</p>\n<p>“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.</p>\n<p>“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink</p>\n<p>suit.”</p>\n<p>“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like</p>\n<p>that.”</p>\n<p>“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?”</p>\n<p>demanded Jordan crossly.</p>\n<p>“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows</p>\n<p>where!”</p>\n<p>We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we</p>",
        "<p>drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded</p>\n<p>eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution</p>\n<p>about gasoline.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.</p>\n<p>“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want to</p>\n<p>get stalled in this baking heat.”</p>\n<p>Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty</p>",
        "<p>stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from</p>\n<p>the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.</p>\n<p>“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we</p>\n<p>stopped for—to admire the view?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”</p>\n<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>\n<p>“I’m all run down.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on</p>\n<p>the phone.”</p>\n<p>With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,</p>\n<p>breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his</p>\n<p>face was green.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money</p>\n<p>pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your</p>",
        "<p>old car.”</p>\n<p>“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.</p>\n<p>“Like to buy it?”</p>\n<p>“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money</p>\n<p>on the other.”</p>\n<p>“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”</p>",
        "<p>“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go</p>\n<p>West.”</p>\n<p>“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.</p>\n<p>“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment</p>\n<p>against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she</p>\n<p>wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”</p>\n<p>The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a</p>",
        "<p>waving hand.</p>\n<p>“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.</p>\n<p>“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked</p>\n<p>Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering</p>\n<p>you about the car.”</p>\n<p>“What do I owe you?”</p>\n<p>“Dollar twenty.”</p>",
        "<p>The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a</p>\n<p>bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t</p>\n<p>alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life</p>\n<p>apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically</p>\n<p>sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel</p>\n<p>discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there</p>\n<p>was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as</p>",
        "<p>the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that</p>\n<p>he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor</p>\n<p>girl with child.</p>\n<p>“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over tomorrow</p>\n<p>afternoon.”</p>\n<p>That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare</p>\n<p>of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of</p>",
        "<p>something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.</p>\n<p>Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that</p>\n<p>other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than</p>\n<p>twenty feet away.</p>\n<p>In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved</p>\n<p>aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So</p>\n<p>engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and</p>",
        "<p>one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a</p>\n<p>slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it</p>\n<p>was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle</p>\n<p>Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized</p>\n<p>that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on</p>\n<p>Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.</p>\n<p>There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we</p>",
        "<p>drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his</p>\n<p>mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping</p>\n<p>precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the</p>\n<p>accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving</p>\n<p>Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an</p>\n<p>hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in</p>\n<p>sight of the easygoing blue coupé.</p>",
        "<p>“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested</p>\n<p>Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away.</p>\n<p>There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of</p>\n<p>funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”</p>\n<p>The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but</p>\n<p>before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy</p>\n<p>signalled us to draw up alongside.</p>",
        "<p>“Where are we going?” she cried.</p>\n<p>“How about the movies?”</p>\n<p>“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you</p>\n<p>after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some</p>\n<p>corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”</p>\n<p>“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave</p>\n<p>out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of</p>",
        "<p>Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”</p>\n<p>Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if</p>\n<p>the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I</p>\n<p>think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his</p>\n<p>life forever.</p>\n<p>But they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging</p>\n<p>the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.</p>",
        "<p>The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into</p>\n<p>that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in</p>\n<p>the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around</p>\n<p>my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.</p>\n<p>The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five</p>\n<p>bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as</p>\n<p>“a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it</p>",
        "<p>was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and</p>\n<p>thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …</p>\n<p>The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four</p>\n<p>o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery</p>\n<p>from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,</p>\n<p>fixing her hair.</p>\n<p>“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone</p>",
        "<p>laughed.</p>\n<p>“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.</p>\n<p>“There aren’t any more.”</p>\n<p>“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”</p>\n<p>“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently.</p>\n<p>“You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”</p>\n<p>He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the</p>",
        "<p>table.</p>\n<p>“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one</p>\n<p>that wanted to come to town.”</p>\n<p>There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its</p>\n<p>nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse</p>\n<p>me”—but this time no one laughed.</p>\n<p>“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.</p>",
        "<p>“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in</p>\n<p>an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.</p>\n<p>“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.</p>\n<p>“What is?”</p>\n<p>“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”</p>\n<p>“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if</p>\n<p>you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.</p>",
        "<p>Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”</p>\n<p>As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound</p>\n<p>and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s</p>\n<p>Wedding March from the ballroom below.</p>\n<p>“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.</p>\n<p>“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.</p>\n<p>“Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”</p>",
        "<p>“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.</p>\n<p>“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a</p>\n<p>fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”</p>\n<p>“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived</p>\n<p>just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy</p>\n<p>told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.”  After</p>\n<p>a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There</p>",
        "<p>wasn’t any connection.”</p>\n<p>“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.</p>\n<p>“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he</p>\n<p>left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”</p>\n<p>The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer</p>\n<p>floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of</p>\n<p>“Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.</p>",
        "<p>“We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and</p>\n<p>dance.”</p>\n<p>“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a</p>\n<p>friend of Daisy’s.”</p>\n<p>“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in</p>\n<p>the private car.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa</p>\n<p>Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room</p>\n<p>for him.”</p>\n<p>Jordan smiled.</p>\n<p>“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of</p>\n<p>your class at Yale.”</p>\n<p>Tom and I looked at each other blankly.</p>",
        "<p>“Biloxi?”</p>\n<p>“First place, we didn’t have any president—”</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.</p>\n<p>“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”</p>\n<p>“Not exactly.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”</p>\n<p>“Yes—I went there.”</p>",
        "<p>A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:</p>\n<p>“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”</p>\n<p>Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice</p>\n<p>but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing</p>\n<p>of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.</p>\n<p>“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.</p>\n<p>“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”</p>",
        "<p>“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I</p>\n<p>can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”</p>\n<p>Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all</p>\n<p>looking at Gatsby.</p>\n<p>“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the</p>\n<p>armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in</p>\n<p>England or France.”</p>",
        "<p>I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those</p>\n<p>renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.</p>\n<p>Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.</p>\n<p>“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep.</p>\n<p>Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint!”</p>\n<p>“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more</p>\n<p>question.”</p>",
        "<p>“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.</p>\n<p>“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”</p>\n<p>They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.</p>\n<p>“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the</p>\n<p>other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”</p>\n<p>“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest</p>\n<p>thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your</p>",
        "<p>wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people</p>\n<p>begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next</p>\n<p>they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between</p>\n<p>black and white.”</p>\n<p>Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone</p>\n<p>on the last barrier of civilization.</p>\n<p>“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.</p>",
        "<p>“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose</p>\n<p>you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any</p>\n<p>friends—in the modern world.”</p>\n<p>Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he</p>\n<p>opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so</p>\n<p>complete.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy</p>",
        "<p>guessed at his intention.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go</p>\n<p>home. Why don’t we all go home?”</p>\n<p>“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”</p>\n<p>“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you.</p>\n<p>She loves me.”</p>",
        "<p>“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.</p>\n<p>Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.</p>\n<p>“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you</p>\n<p>because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a</p>\n<p>terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”</p>\n<p>At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted</p>\n<p>with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had</p>",
        "<p>anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously</p>\n<p>of their emotions.</p>\n<p>“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal</p>\n<p>note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”</p>\n<p>“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five</p>\n<p>years—and you didn’t know.”</p>\n<p>Tom turned to Daisy sharply.</p>",
        "<p>“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”</p>\n<p>“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved</p>\n<p>each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to</p>\n<p>laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that</p>\n<p>you didn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a</p>\n<p>clergyman and leaned back in his chair.</p>",
        "<p>“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five</p>\n<p>years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I</p>\n<p>see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries</p>\n<p>to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy</p>\n<p>loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish</p>",
        "<p>ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded</p>\n<p>sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off</p>\n<p>on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in</p>\n<p>my heart I love her all the time.”</p>\n<p>“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,</p>\n<p>dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do</p>\n<p>you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you</p>",
        "<p>to the story of that little spree.”</p>\n<p>Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.</p>\n<p>“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter</p>\n<p>any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s</p>\n<p>all wiped out forever.”</p>\n<p>She looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”</p>\n<p>“You never loved him.”</p>",
        "<p>She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,</p>\n<p>as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she</p>\n<p>had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done</p>\n<p>now. It was too late.</p>\n<p>“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.</p>\n<p>“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>",
        "<p>From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were</p>\n<p>drifting up on hot waves of air.</p>\n<p>“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your</p>\n<p>shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone … “Daisy?”</p>\n<p>“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.</p>\n<p>She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried</p>\n<p>to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette</p>",
        "<p>and the burning match on the carpet.</p>\n<p>“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t</p>\n<p>that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob</p>\n<p>helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.</p>\n<p>“You loved me too?” he repeated.</p>\n<p>“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were</p>",
        "<p>alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know,</p>\n<p>things that neither of us can ever forget.”</p>\n<p>The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.</p>\n<p>“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited</p>\n<p>now—”</p>\n<p>“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful</p>\n<p>voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”</p>",
        "<p>“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.</p>\n<p>She turned to her husband.</p>\n<p>“As if it mattered to you,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now</p>\n<p>on.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re</p>\n<p>not going to take care of her any more.”</p>",
        "<p>“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to</p>\n<p>control himself now. “Why’s that?”</p>\n<p>“Daisy’s leaving you.”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense.”</p>\n<p>“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.</p>\n<p>“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.</p>\n<p>“Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he</p>",
        "<p>put on her finger.”</p>\n<p>“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that</p>\n<p>hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve</p>\n<p>made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it</p>\n<p>further tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.</p>",
        "<p>“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke</p>\n<p>rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street</p>\n<p>drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the</p>\n<p>counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a</p>\n<p>bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”</p>\n<p>“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter</p>\n<p>Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”</p>",
        "<p>“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for</p>\n<p>a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the</p>\n<p>subject of you.”</p>\n<p>“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old</p>\n<p>sport.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said</p>\n<p>nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but</p>",
        "<p>Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”</p>\n<p>That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.</p>\n<p>“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,</p>\n<p>“but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me</p>\n<p>about.”</p>\n<p>I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her</p>\n<p>husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but</p>",
        "<p>absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to</p>\n<p>Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said</p>\n<p>in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had</p>\n<p>“killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in</p>\n<p>just that fantastic way.</p>\n<p>It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying</p>\n<p>everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been</p>",
        "<p>made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into</p>\n<p>herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the</p>\n<p>afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,</p>\n<p>struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across</p>\n<p>the room.</p>\n<p>The voice begged again to go.</p>\n<p>“Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”</p>",
        "<p>Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage</p>\n<p>she had had, were definitely gone.</p>\n<p>“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”</p>\n<p>She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous</p>\n<p>scorn.</p>\n<p>“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous</p>\n<p>little flirtation is over.”</p>",
        "<p>They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,</p>\n<p>isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.</p>\n<p>After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of</p>\n<p>whisky in the towel.</p>\n<p>“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?”</p>\n<p>I didn’t answer.</p>\n<p>“Nick?” He asked again.</p>",
        "<p>“What?”</p>\n<p>“Want any?”</p>\n<p>“No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday.”</p>\n<p>I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a</p>\n<p>new decade.</p>\n<p>It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started</p>\n<p>for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but</p>",
        "<p>his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on</p>\n<p>the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy</p>\n<p>has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments</p>\n<p>fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of</p>\n<p>loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning</p>\n<p>briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside</p>\n<p>me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten</p>",
        "<p>dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face</p>\n<p>fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of</p>\n<p>thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.</p>\n<p>So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.</p>\n<p>The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the</p>\n<p>ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept</p>\n<p>through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the</p>",
        "<p>garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale</p>\n<p>as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go</p>\n<p>to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if</p>\n<p>he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent</p>\n<p>racket broke out overhead.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.</p>\n<p>“She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re</p>",
        "<p>going to move away.”</p>\n<p>Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and</p>\n<p>Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.</p>\n<p>Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he</p>\n<p>sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars</p>\n<p>that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably</p>\n<p>laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not</p>",
        "<p>his own.</p>\n<p>So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson</p>\n<p>wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious</p>\n<p>glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain</p>\n<p>times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some</p>\n<p>workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis</p>\n<p>took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he</p>",
        "<p>didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside</p>\n<p>again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation</p>\n<p>because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in</p>\n<p>the garage.</p>\n<p>“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty</p>\n<p>little coward!”</p>\n<p>A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and</p>",
        "<p>shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.</p>\n<p>The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out</p>\n<p>of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then</p>\n<p>disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of</p>\n<p>its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The</p>\n<p>other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards</p>\n<p>beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life</p>",
        "<p>violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark</p>\n<p>blood with the dust.</p>\n<p>Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open</p>\n<p>her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left</p>\n<p>breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen</p>\n<p>for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at</p>\n<p>the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the</p>",
        "<p>tremendous vitality she had stored so long.</p>\n<p>We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still</p>\n<p>some distance away.</p>\n<p>“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at</p>\n<p>last.”</p>\n<p>He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as</p>\n<p>we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage</p>",
        "<p>door made him automatically put on the brakes.</p>\n<p>“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”</p>\n<p>I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly</p>\n<p>from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked</p>\n<p>toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered</p>\n<p>over and over in a gasping moan.</p>\n<p>“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.</p>",
        "<p>He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the</p>\n<p>garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal</p>\n<p>basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a</p>\n<p>violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way</p>\n<p>through.</p>\n<p>The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it</p>\n<p>was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals</p>",
        "<p>deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.</p>\n<p>Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another</p>\n<p>blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on</p>\n<p>a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending</p>\n<p>over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking</p>\n<p>down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I</p>\n<p>couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed</p>",
        "<p>clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the</p>\n<p>raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to</p>\n<p>the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low</p>\n<p>voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his</p>\n<p>shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly</p>\n<p>from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk</p>\n<p>back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,</p>",
        "<p>horrible call:</p>\n<p>“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”</p>\n<p>Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around</p>\n<p>the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to</p>\n<p>the policeman.</p>\n<p>“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”</p>\n<p>“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”</p>",
        "<p>“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.</p>\n<p>“r—” said the policeman, “o—”</p>\n<p>“g—”</p>\n<p>“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>“What you want, fella?”</p>\n<p>“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”</p>\n<p>“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”</p>",
        "<p>“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.</p>\n<p>“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”</p>\n<p>“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”</p>\n<p>“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.</p>\n<p>“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but</p>\n<p>stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one</p>\n<p>comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles</p>",
        "<p>an hour.”</p>\n<p>“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.</p>\n<p>“Hasn’t got any name.”</p>\n<p>A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.</p>\n<p>“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”</p>\n<p>“See the accident?” asked the policeman.</p>\n<p>“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going</p>",
        "<p>fifty, sixty.”</p>\n<p>“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his</p>\n<p>name.”</p>\n<p>Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in</p>\n<p>the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his</p>\n<p>grasping cries:</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind</p>",
        "<p>of car it was!”</p>\n<p>Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten</p>\n<p>under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in</p>\n<p>front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing</p>\n<p>gruffness.</p>\n<p>Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then</p>",
        "<p>would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.</p>\n<p>“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute</p>\n<p>ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking</p>\n<p>about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you</p>\n<p>hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”</p>\n<p>Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the</p>\n<p>policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent</p>",
        "<p>eyes.</p>\n<p>“What’s all that?” he demanded.</p>\n<p>“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on</p>\n<p>Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow</p>\n<p>car.”</p>\n<p>Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.</p>\n<p>“And what colour’s your car?”</p>",
        "<p>“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.</p>\n<p>Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and</p>\n<p>the policeman turned away.</p>\n<p>“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”</p>\n<p>Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set</p>\n<p>him down in a chair, and came back.</p>",
        "<p>“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped</p>\n<p>authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced</p>\n<p>at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the</p>\n<p>door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the</p>\n<p>table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”</p>\n<p>Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we</p>\n<p>pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,</p>",
        "<p>case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.</p>\n<p>Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down</p>\n<p>hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I</p>\n<p>heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down</p>\n<p>his face.</p>\n<p>“The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”</p>\n<p>The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark</p>",
        "<p>rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the</p>\n<p>second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.</p>\n<p>“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and</p>\n<p>frowned slightly.</p>\n<p>“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can</p>\n<p>do tonight.”</p>\n<p>A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.</p>",
        "<p>As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of</p>\n<p>the situation in a few brisk phrases.</p>\n<p>“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting</p>\n<p>you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some</p>\n<p>supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”</p>\n<p>“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait</p>\n<p>outside.”</p>",
        "<p>Jordan put her hand on my arm.</p>\n<p>“Won’t you come in, Nick?”</p>\n<p>“No, thanks.”</p>\n<p>I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan</p>\n<p>lingered for a moment more.</p>\n<p>“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.</p>\n<p>I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day,</p>",
        "<p>and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of</p>\n<p>this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the</p>\n<p>porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head</p>\n<p>in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s</p>\n<p>voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from</p>\n<p>the house, intending to wait by the gate.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped</p>",
        "<p>from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird</p>\n<p>by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity</p>\n<p>of his pink suit under the moon.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>“Just standing here, old sport.”</p>\n<p>Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was</p>\n<p>going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to</p>",
        "<p>see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in</p>\n<p>the dark shrubbery.</p>\n<p>“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>He hesitated.</p>\n<p>“Was she killed?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>",
        "<p>“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock</p>\n<p>should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”</p>\n<p>He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.</p>\n<p>“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in</p>\n<p>my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be</p>\n<p>sure.”</p>\n<p>I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to</p>",
        "<p>tell him he was wrong.</p>\n<p>“Who was the woman?” he inquired.</p>\n<p>“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did</p>\n<p>it happen?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I</p>\n<p>guessed at the truth.</p>\n<p>“Was Daisy driving?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see,</p>\n<p>when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would</p>\n<p>steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were</p>\n<p>passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but</p>\n<p>it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were</p>\n<p>somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward</p>\n<p>the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second</p>",
        "<p>my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her</p>\n<p>instantly.”</p>\n<p>“It ripped her open—”</p>\n<p>“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I</p>\n<p>tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency</p>\n<p>brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.</p>\n<p>“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to</p>",
        "<p>wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness</p>\n<p>this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries</p>\n<p>any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”</p>\n<p>“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t trust him, old sport.”</p>\n<p>“How long are you going to wait?”</p>\n<p>“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”</p>",
        "<p>A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy</p>\n<p>had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might</p>\n<p>think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright</p>\n<p>windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground</p>\n<p>floor.</p>\n<p>“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a</p>\n<p>commotion.”</p>",
        "<p>I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel</p>\n<p>softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains</p>\n<p>were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where</p>\n<p>we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small</p>\n<p>rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind</p>\n<p>was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.</p>\n<p>Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,</p>",
        "<p>with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of</p>\n<p>ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his</p>\n<p>earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a</p>\n<p>while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.</p>\n<p>They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the</p>\n<p>ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air</p>\n<p>of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said</p>",
        "<p>that they were conspiring together.</p>\n<p>As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the</p>\n<p>dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in</p>\n<p>the drive.</p>\n<p>“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get</p>\n<p>some sleep.”</p>",
        "<p>He shook his head.</p>\n<p>“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”</p>\n<p>He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his</p>\n<p>scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of</p>\n<p>the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the</p>\n<p>moonlight—watching over nothing.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>\n<p>I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the</p>\n<p>Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,</p>\n<p>frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive,</p>\n<p>and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I</p>\n<p>had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning</p>\n<p>would be too late.</p>",
        "<p>Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was</p>\n<p>leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.</p>\n<p>“Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I waited, and about four o’clock</p>\n<p>she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned</p>\n<p>out the light.”</p>\n<p>His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when</p>\n<p>we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside</p>",
        "<p>curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of</p>\n<p>dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of</p>\n<p>splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable</p>\n<p>amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they</p>\n<p>hadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar</p>\n<p>table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French</p>\n<p>windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.</p>",
        "<p>“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace</p>\n<p>your car.”</p>\n<p>“Go away now, old sport?”</p>\n<p>“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”</p>\n<p>He wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he</p>\n<p>knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and</p>\n<p>I couldn’t bear to shake him free.</p>",
        "<p>It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with</p>\n<p>Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass</p>\n<p>against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played</p>\n<p>out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without</p>\n<p>reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.</p>\n<p>She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed</p>\n<p>capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with</p>",
        "<p>indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly</p>\n<p>desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from</p>\n<p>Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a</p>\n<p>beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless</p>\n<p>intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her</p>\n<p>as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,</p>\n<p>a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other</p>",
        "<p>bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its</p>\n<p>corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already</p>\n<p>in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s</p>\n<p>shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely</p>\n<p>withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved</p>\n<p>Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all</p>\n<p>about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still</p>",
        "<p>vibrant emotions.</p>\n<p>But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal</p>\n<p>accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was</p>\n<p>at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the</p>\n<p>invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he</p>\n<p>made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and</p>\n<p>unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took</p>",
        "<p>her because he had no real right to touch her hand.</p>\n<p>He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under</p>\n<p>false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom</p>\n<p>millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he</p>\n<p>let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as</p>\n<p>herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of</p>\n<p>fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing</p>",
        "<p>behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government</p>\n<p>to be blown anywhere about the world.</p>\n<p>But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had</p>\n<p>imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but</p>\n<p>now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a</p>\n<p>grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize</p>\n<p>just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her</p>",
        "<p>rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt</p>\n<p>married to her, that was all.</p>\n<p>When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,</p>\n<p>who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought</p>\n<p>luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as</p>\n<p>she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She</p>\n<p>had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming</p>",
        "<p>than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and</p>\n<p>mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many</p>\n<p>clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the</p>\n<p>hot struggles of the poor.</p>\n<p>“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,</p>\n<p>old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she</p>\n<p>didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot</p>",
        "<p>because I knew different things from her … Well, there I was, way off</p>\n<p>my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden</p>\n<p>I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have</p>\n<p>a better time telling her what I was going to do?”</p>\n<p>On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his</p>\n<p>arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the</p>\n<p>room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his</p>",
        "<p>arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon</p>\n<p>had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory</p>\n<p>for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer</p>\n<p>in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with</p>\n<p>another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder</p>\n<p>or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were</p>\n<p>asleep.</p>",
        "<p>He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he</p>\n<p>went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his</p>\n<p>majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the</p>\n<p>armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or</p>\n<p>misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there</p>\n<p>was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see</p>\n<p>why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world</p>",
        "<p>outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her</p>\n<p>and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.</p>\n<p>For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids</p>\n<p>and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of</p>\n<p>the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new</p>\n<p>tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the</p>\n<p>“Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver</p>",
        "<p>slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were</p>\n<p>always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,</p>\n<p>while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the</p>\n<p>sad horns around the floor.</p>\n<p>Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the</p>\n<p>season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with</p>\n<p>half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and</p>",
        "<p>chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor</p>\n<p>beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a</p>\n<p>decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision</p>\n<p>must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable</p>\n<p>practicality—that was close at hand.</p>\n<p>That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom</p>\n<p>Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his</p>",
        "<p>position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain</p>\n<p>struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was</p>\n<p>still at Oxford.</p>\n<p>It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of</p>\n<p>the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,</p>\n<p>gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew</p>\n<p>and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a</p>",
        "<p>slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,</p>\n<p>lovely day.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window</p>\n<p>and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was</p>\n<p>very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that</p>\n<p>frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap</p>\n<p>sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”</p>",
        "<p>He sat down gloomily.</p>\n<p>“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were</p>\n<p>first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”</p>\n<p>Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.</p>\n<p>“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”</p>\n<p>What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his</p>\n<p>conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?</p>",
        "<p>He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their</p>\n<p>wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to</p>\n<p>Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week,</p>\n<p>walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through</p>\n<p>the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which</p>\n<p>they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always</p>\n<p>seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea</p>",
        "<p>of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded</p>\n<p>with a melancholy beauty.</p>\n<p>He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found</p>\n<p>her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless</p>\n<p>now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a</p>\n<p>folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar</p>\n<p>buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow</p>",
        "<p>trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have</p>\n<p>seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.</p>\n<p>The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it</p>\n<p>sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing</p>\n<p>city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand</p>\n<p>desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of</p>\n<p>the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too</p>",
        "<p>fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part</p>\n<p>of it, the freshest and the best, forever.</p>\n<p>It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the</p>\n<p>porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there</p>\n<p>was an autumn flavour in the air. The gardener, the last one of</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start</p>",
        "<p>falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.</p>\n<p>“You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”</p>\n<p>I looked at my watch and stood up.</p>\n<p>“Twelve minutes to my train.”</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of</p>\n<p>work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I</p>",
        "<p>missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.</p>\n<p>“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.</p>\n<p>“Do, old sport.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll call you about noon.”</p>\n<p>We walked slowly down the steps.</p>\n<p>“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he</p>\n<p>hoped I’d corroborate this.</p>",
        "<p>“I suppose so.”</p>\n<p>“Well, goodbye.”</p>\n<p>We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I</p>\n<p>remembered something and turned around.</p>\n<p>“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the</p>\n<p>whole damn bunch put together.”</p>\n<p>I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever</p>",
        "<p>gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he</p>\n<p>nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and</p>\n<p>understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact</p>\n<p>all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of</p>\n<p>colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I</p>\n<p>first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and</p>\n<p>drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his</p>",
        "<p>corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his</p>\n<p>incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.</p>\n<p>I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for</p>\n<p>that—I and the others.</p>\n<p>“Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”</p>\n<p>Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an</p>\n<p>interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.</p>",
        "<p>Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat</p>\n<p>breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me</p>\n<p>up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between</p>\n<p>hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other</p>\n<p>way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool,</p>\n<p>as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the</p>\n<p>office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.</p>",
        "<p>“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going</p>\n<p>down to Southampton this afternoon.”</p>\n<p>Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act</p>\n<p>annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.</p>\n<p>“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”</p>\n<p>“How could it have mattered then?”</p>\n<p>Silence for a moment. Then:</p>",
        "<p>“However—I want to see you.”</p>\n<p>“I want to see you, too.”</p>\n<p>“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this</p>\n<p>afternoon?”</p>\n<p>“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”</p>\n<p>“Very well.”</p>\n<p>“It’s impossible this afternoon. Various—”</p>",
        "<p>We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking</p>\n<p>any longer. I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I</p>\n<p>know I didn’t care. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table</p>\n<p>that day if I never talked to her again in this world.</p>\n<p>I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I</p>\n<p>tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was</p>\n<p>being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my</p>",
        "<p>timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I</p>\n<p>leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.</p>\n<p>When I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed</p>\n<p>deliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there’d be a</p>\n<p>curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark</p>\n<p>spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what</p>\n<p>had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he</p>",
        "<p>could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was</p>\n<p>forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at</p>\n<p>the garage after we left there the night before.</p>\n<p>They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have</p>\n<p>broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she</p>\n<p>was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had</p>\n<p>already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she</p>",
        "<p>immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the</p>\n<p>affair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in</p>\n<p>the wake of her sister’s body.</p>\n<p>Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front</p>\n<p>of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on</p>\n<p>the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and</p>\n<p>everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.</p>",
        "<p>Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis</p>\n<p>and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later</p>\n<p>two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger</p>\n<p>to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own</p>\n<p>place and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with</p>\n<p>Wilson until dawn.</p>\n<p>About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering</p>",
        "<p>changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He</p>\n<p>announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car</p>\n<p>belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his</p>\n<p>wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose</p>\n<p>swollen.</p>\n<p>But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,</p>\n<p>my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt</p>",
        "<p>to distract him.</p>\n<p>“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit</p>\n<p>still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been</p>\n<p>married?”</p>\n<p>“Twelve years.”</p>\n<p>“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a</p>\n<p>question. Did you ever have any children?”</p>",
        "<p>The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and</p>\n<p>whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it</p>\n<p>sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.</p>\n<p>He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was</p>\n<p>stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably</p>\n<p>around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from</p>\n<p>time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.</p>",
        "<p>“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you</p>\n<p>haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church</p>\n<p>and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t belong to any.”</p>\n<p>“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must</p>\n<p>have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen,</p>\n<p>George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”</p>",
        "<p>“That was a long time ago.”</p>\n<p>The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment</p>\n<p>he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came</p>\n<p>back into his faded eyes.</p>\n<p>“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.</p>\n<p>“Which drawer?”</p>\n<p>“That drawer—that one.”</p>",
        "<p>Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it</p>\n<p>but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided</p>\n<p>silver. It was apparently new.</p>\n<p>“This?” he inquired, holding it up.</p>\n<p>Wilson stared and nodded.</p>\n<p>“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I</p>\n<p>knew it was something funny.”</p>",
        "<p>“You mean your wife bought it?”</p>\n<p>“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”</p>\n<p>Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen</p>\n<p>reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably</p>\n<p>Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,</p>\n<p>because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter</p>\n<p>left several explanations in the air.</p>",
        "<p>“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.</p>\n<p>“Who did?”</p>\n<p>“I have a way of finding out.”</p>\n<p>“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to</p>\n<p>you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit</p>\n<p>quiet till morning.”</p>\n<p>“He murdered her.”</p>",
        "<p>“It was an accident, George.”</p>\n<p>Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened</p>\n<p>slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”</p>\n<p>“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I</p>\n<p>don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know</p>\n<p>it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he</p>\n<p>wouldn’t stop.”</p>",
        "<p>Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there</p>\n<p>was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had</p>\n<p>been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any</p>\n<p>particular car.</p>\n<p>“How could she of been like that?”</p>\n<p>“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question.</p>\n<p>“Ah-h-h—”</p>",
        "<p>He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his</p>\n<p>hand.</p>\n<p>“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”</p>\n<p>This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:</p>\n<p>there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later</p>\n<p>when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window,</p>\n<p>and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue</p>",
        "<p>enough outside to snap off the light.</p>\n<p>Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey</p>\n<p>clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the</p>\n<p>faint dawn wind.</p>\n<p>“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she</p>\n<p>might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the</p>\n<p>window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and</p>",
        "<p>leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what</p>\n<p>you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but</p>\n<p>you can’t fool God!’ ”</p>\n<p>Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at</p>\n<p>the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and</p>\n<p>enormous, from the dissolving night.</p>\n<p>“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.</p>",
        "<p>“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him</p>\n<p>turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson</p>\n<p>stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding</p>\n<p>into the twilight.</p>\n<p>By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a</p>\n<p>car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before</p>\n<p>who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which</p>",
        "<p>he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and</p>\n<p>Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and</p>\n<p>hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.</p>\n<p>His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to</p>\n<p>Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that</p>\n<p>he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and</p>\n<p>walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far</p>",
        "<p>there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who</p>\n<p>had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared</p>\n<p>oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared</p>\n<p>from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,</p>\n<p>that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time</p>\n<p>going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On</p>\n<p>the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and</p>",
        "<p>perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to</p>\n<p>know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the</p>\n<p>way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.</p>\n<p>At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the</p>\n<p>butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the</p>\n<p>pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had</p>\n<p>amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to</p>",
        "<p>pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be</p>\n<p>taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the</p>\n<p>front right fender needed repair.</p>\n<p>Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he</p>\n<p>stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he</p>\n<p>needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among</p>\n<p>the yellowing trees.</p>",
        "<p>No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep</p>\n<p>and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone</p>\n<p>to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t</p>\n<p>believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was</p>\n<p>true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a</p>\n<p>high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have</p>\n<p>looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered</p>",
        "<p>as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight</p>\n<p>was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without</p>\n<p>being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted</p>\n<p>fortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward</p>\n<p>him through the amorphous trees.</p>\n<p>The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the</p>\n<p>shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything</p>",
        "<p>much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house</p>\n<p>and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that</p>\n<p>alarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a</p>\n<p>word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried</p>\n<p>down to the pool.</p>\n<p>There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the</p>\n<p>fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.</p>",
        "<p>With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden</p>\n<p>mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that</p>\n<p>scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental</p>\n<p>course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves</p>\n<p>revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red</p>\n<p>circle in the water.</p>\n<p>It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener</p>",
        "<p>saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was</p>\n<p>complete.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter IX</h3>\n<p>After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and</p>\n<p>the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and</p>\n<p>newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretched</p>\n<p>across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but</p>\n<p>little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and</p>\n<p>there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the</p>",
        "<p>pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the</p>\n<p>expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and</p>\n<p>the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper</p>\n<p>reports next morning.</p>\n<p>Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,</p>\n<p>eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought</p>\n<p>to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale</p>",
        "<p>would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might</p>\n<p>have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount</p>\n<p>of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes</p>\n<p>under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never</p>\n<p>seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,</p>\n<p>that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced</p>\n<p>herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very</p>",
        "<p>suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a</p>\n<p>man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its</p>\n<p>simplest form. And it rested there.</p>\n<p>But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself</p>\n<p>on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the</p>\n<p>catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every</p>\n<p>practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and</p>",
        "<p>confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or</p>\n<p>speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because</p>\n<p>no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense</p>\n<p>personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.</p>\n<p>I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her</p>\n<p>instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away</p>\n<p>early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.</p>",
        "<p>“Left no address?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Say when they’d be back?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. Can’t say.”</p>\n<p>I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where</p>",
        "<p>he lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t</p>\n<p>worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”</p>\n<p>Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave me</p>\n<p>his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the</p>\n<p>time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the</p>\n<p>phone.</p>\n<p>“Will you ring again?”</p>",
        "<p>“I’ve rung three times.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very important.”</p>\n<p>“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”</p>\n<p>I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they</p>\n<p>were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled</p>\n<p>it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with</p>\n<p>shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:</p>",
        "<p>“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got</p>\n<p>to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”</p>\n<p>Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going</p>\n<p>upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d</p>\n<p>never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was</p>\n<p>nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,</p>\n<p>staring down from the wall.</p>",
        "<p>Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,</p>\n<p>which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next</p>\n<p>train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure</p>\n<p>he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a</p>\n<p>wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem</p>\n<p>arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and</p>\n<p>newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began</p>",
        "<p>to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby</p>\n<p>and me against them all.</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of</p>\n<p>my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a</p>\n<p>mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down</p>\n<p>now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get</p>\n<p>mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little</p>",
        "<p>later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when</p>\n<p>I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and</p>\n<p>out.</p>\n<p>Yours truly</p>\n<p>Meyer Wolfshiem</p>\n<p>and then hasty addenda beneath:</p>\n<p>Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.</p>",
        "<p>When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was</p>\n<p>calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came</p>\n<p>through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.</p>\n<p>“This is Slagle speaking …”</p>\n<p>“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.</p>\n<p>“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”</p>\n<p>“There haven’t been any wires.”</p>",
        "<p>“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when</p>\n<p>he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New</p>\n<p>York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know</p>\n<p>about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”</p>\n<p>“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr.</p>\n<p>Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”</p>\n<p>There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an</p>",
        "<p>exclamation … then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.</p>\n<p>I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz</p>\n<p>arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was</p>\n<p>leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.</p>\n<p>It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,</p>\n<p>bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His</p>\n<p>eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and</p>",
        "<p>umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse</p>\n<p>grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on</p>\n<p>the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him</p>\n<p>sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and</p>\n<p>the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.</p>\n<p>“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the</p>\n<p>Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”</p>",
        "<p>“I didn’t know how to reach you.”</p>\n<p>His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.</p>\n<p>“It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”</p>\n<p>“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”</p>\n<p>“Carraway.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”</p>",
        "<p>I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him</p>\n<p>there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into</p>\n<p>the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly</p>\n<p>away.</p>\n<p>After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth</p>\n<p>ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and</p>\n<p>unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the</p>",
        "<p>quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the</p>\n<p>first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great</p>\n<p>rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be</p>\n<p>mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he</p>\n<p>took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been</p>\n<p>deferred until he came.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”</p>",
        "<p>“Gatz is my name.”</p>\n<p>“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in</p>\n<p>the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”</p>\n<p>“We were close friends.”</p>\n<p>“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man,</p>",
        "<p>but he had a lot of brain power here.”</p>\n<p>He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.</p>\n<p>“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J.</p>\n<p>Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”</p>\n<p>“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the</p>\n<p>bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.</p>",
        "<p>That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to</p>\n<p>know who I was before he would give his name.</p>\n<p>“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is Klipspringer.”</p>\n<p>I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a</p>\n<p>sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. They</p>",
        "<p>were hard to find.</p>\n<p>“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house.</p>\n<p>I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see</p>\n<p>anybody, but if I do.”</p>\n<p>His tone made me suspicious.</p>\n<p>“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is—”</p>\n<p>“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about saying you’ll come?”</p>\n<p>“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with</p>\n<p>some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with</p>\n<p>them tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of</p>\n<p>course I’ll do my best to get away.”</p>\n<p>I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he</p>",
        "<p>went on nervously:</p>\n<p>“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if</p>\n<p>it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see,</p>\n<p>they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My</p>\n<p>address is care of B. F.—”</p>\n<p>I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.</p>\n<p>After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I</p>",
        "<p>telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was</p>\n<p>my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at</p>\n<p>Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known</p>\n<p>better than to call him.</p>\n<p>The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer</p>\n<p>Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that I</p>\n<p>pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The</p>",
        "<p>Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone</p>\n<p>inside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an</p>\n<p>argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess</p>\n<p>appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile</p>\n<p>eyes.</p>\n<p>“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”</p>\n<p>The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to</p>",
        "<p>whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.</p>\n<p>“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”</p>\n<p>At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!”</p>\n<p>from the other side of the door.</p>\n<p>“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him</p>\n<p>when he gets back.”</p>",
        "<p>“But I know he’s there.”</p>\n<p>She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up</p>\n<p>and down her hips.</p>\n<p>“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she</p>\n<p>scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago,</p>\n<p>he’s in Chicago.”</p>\n<p>I mentioned Gatsby.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your</p>\n<p>name?”</p>\n<p>She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the</p>\n<p>doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking</p>\n<p>in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered</p>\n<p>me a cigar.</p>\n<p>“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major</p>",
        "<p>just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.</p>\n<p>He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he</p>\n<p>couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he</p>\n<p>came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a</p>\n<p>job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some</p>\n<p>lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food</p>\n<p>in half an hour.”</p>",
        "<p>“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>“Start him! I made him.”</p>\n<p>“Oh.”</p>\n<p>“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right</p>\n<p>away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told</p>\n<p>me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join</p>\n<p>the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did</p>",
        "<p>some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like</p>\n<p>that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”</p>\n<p>I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series</p>\n<p>transaction in 1919.</p>\n<p>“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend,</p>\n<p>so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”</p>\n<p>“I’d like to come.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, come then.”</p>\n<p>The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head</p>\n<p>his eyes filled with tears.</p>\n<p>“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”</p>\n<p>“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any</p>\n<p>way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend</p>",
        "<p>of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may</p>\n<p>think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”</p>\n<p>I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,</p>\n<p>so I stood up.</p>\n<p>“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.</p>\n<p>For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he</p>\n<p>only nodded and shook my hand.</p>",
        "<p>“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and</p>\n<p>not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let</p>\n<p>everything alone.”</p>\n<p>When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West</p>\n<p>Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found</p>\n<p>Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his</p>\n<p>son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he</p>",
        "<p>had something to show me.</p>\n<p>“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling</p>\n<p>fingers. “Look there.”</p>\n<p>It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty</p>\n<p>with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Look</p>\n<p>there!” and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so</p>\n<p>often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.</p>",
        "<p>“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up</p>\n<p>well.”</p>\n<p>“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”</p>\n<p>“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in</p>\n<p>now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see</p>\n<p>now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of</p>\n<p>him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”</p>",
        "<p>He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another</p>\n<p>minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and</p>\n<p>pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong</p>\n<p>Cassidy.</p>\n<p>“Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On</p>",

He always had some resolves like this</p>\n<p>or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He</p>",
        "<p>was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat</p>\n<p>him for it.”</p>\n<p>He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then</p>\n<p>looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the</p>\n<p>list for my own use.</p>\n<p>A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and</p>\n<p>I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby’s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and</p>\n<p>stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he</p>\n<p>spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced</p>\n<p>several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait</p>\n<p>for half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.</p>\n<p>About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery</p>\n<p>and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse,</p>",
        "<p>horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the</p>\n<p>limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman</p>\n<p>from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we</p>\n<p>started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then</p>\n<p>the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I</p>\n<p>looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found</p>\n<p>marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months</p>",
        "<p>before.</p>\n<p>I’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the</p>\n<p>funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and</p>\n<p>he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled</p>\n<p>from Gatsby’s grave.</p>\n<p>I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already</p>\n<p>too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that</p>",
        "<p>Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur</p>\n<p>“Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed</p>\n<p>man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.</p>\n<p>We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke</p>\n<p>to me by the gate.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.</p>\n<p>“Neither could anybody else.”</p>",
        "<p>“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the</p>\n<p>hundreds.”</p>\n<p>He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.</p>\n<p>“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.</p>\n<p>One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school</p>\n<p>and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than</p>\n<p>Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a</p>",
        "<p>December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into</p>\n<p>their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember</p>\n<p>the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the</p>\n<p>chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught</p>\n<p>sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you</p>\n<p>going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long</p>\n<p>green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky</p>",
        "<p>yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking</p>\n<p>cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.</p>\n<p>When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,</p>\n<p>began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and</p>\n<p>the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild</p>\n<p>brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we</p>\n<p>walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware</p>",
        "<p>of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we</p>\n<p>melted indistinguishably into it again.</p>\n<p>That’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede</p>\n<p>towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street</p>\n<p>lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly</p>\n<p>wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a</p>\n<p>little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent</p>",
        "<p>from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are</p>\n<p>still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this</p>\n<p>has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and</p>\n<p>Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some</p>\n<p>deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.</p>\n<p>Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware</p>\n<p>of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the</p>",
        "<p>Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the</p>\n<p>children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of</p>\n<p>distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic</p>\n<p>dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at</p>\n<p>once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging</p>\n<p>sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress</p>\n<p>suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a</p>",
        "<p>drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over</p>\n<p>the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a</p>\n<p>house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one</p>\n<p>cares.</p>\n<p>After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted</p>\n<p>beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle</p>\n<p>leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the</p>",
        "<p>line I decided to come back home.</p>\n<p>There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant</p>\n<p>thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to</p>\n<p>leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent</p>\n<p>sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and</p>\n<p>around what had happened to us together, and what had happened</p>\n<p>afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big</p>",
        "<p>chair.</p>\n<p>She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like</p>\n<p>a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the</p>\n<p>colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the</p>\n<p>fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without</p>\n<p>comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though</p>\n<p>there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I</p>",
        "<p>pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t</p>\n<p>making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up</p>\n<p>to say goodbye.</p>\n<p>“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw</p>\n<p>me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it</p>\n<p>was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”</p>\n<p>We shook hands.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about</p>\n<p>driving a car?”</p>\n<p>“Why—not exactly.”</p>\n<p>“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?</p>\n<p>Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me</p>\n<p>to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,</p>\n<p>straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”</p>",
        "<p>“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and</p>\n<p>call it honour.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously</p>\n<p>sorry, I turned away.</p>\n<p>One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead</p>\n<p>of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a</p>\n<p>little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving</p>",
        "<p>sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as</p>\n<p>I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into</p>\n<p>the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back,</p>\n<p>holding out his hand.</p>\n<p>“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. You know what I think of you.”</p>\n<p>“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know</p>",
        "<p>what’s the matter with you.”</p>\n<p>“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”</p>\n<p>He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about</p>\n<p>those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after</p>\n<p>me and grabbed my arm.</p>\n<p>“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were</p>\n<p>getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in</p>",
        "<p>he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if</p>\n<p>I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his</p>\n<p>pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly.</p>\n<p>“What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw</p>\n<p>dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough</p>\n<p>one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even</p>\n<p>stopped his car.”</p>",
        "<p>There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it</p>\n<p>wasn’t true.</p>\n<p>“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when</p>\n<p>I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits</p>\n<p>sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By</p>\n<p>God it was awful—”</p>\n<p>I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done</p>",
        "<p>was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and</p>\n<p>confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up</p>\n<p>things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their</p>\n<p>vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let</p>\n<p>other people clean up the mess they had made …</p>\n<p>I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as</p>\n<p>though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery</p>",
        "<p>store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff</p>\n<p>buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.</p>\n<p>Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had</p>\n<p>grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never</p>\n<p>took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and</p>\n<p>pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to</p>\n<p>East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story</p>",
        "<p>about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when</p>\n<p>I got off the train.</p>\n<p>I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,</p>\n<p>dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still</p>\n<p>hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,</p>\n<p>and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a</p>\n<p>material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I</p>",
        "<p>didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away</p>\n<p>at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.</p>\n<p>On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,</p>\n<p>I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once</p>\n<p>more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a</p>\n<p>piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,</p>\n<p>drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the</p>",
        "<p>beach and sprawled out on the sand.</p>\n<p>Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any</p>\n<p>lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the</p>\n<p>Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to</p>\n<p>melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that</p>\n<p>flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new</p>\n<p>world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s</p>",
        "<p>house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all</p>\n<p>human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his</p>\n<p>breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic</p>\n<p>contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the</p>\n<p>last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for</p>\n<p>wonder.</p>\n<p>And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of</p>",
        "<p>Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of</p>\n<p>Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream</p>\n<p>must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He</p>\n<p>did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that</p>\n<p>vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic</p>\n<p>rolled on under the night.</p>\n<p>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by</p>",
        "<p>year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no</p>\n<p>matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … And</p>\n<p>one fine morning—</p>\n<p>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into</p>\n<p>the past.</p>"
