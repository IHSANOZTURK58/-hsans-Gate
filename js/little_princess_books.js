        "<p>Anne</p>\n<p>A Little Princess</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>Sara</p>\n<p>Once on a dark winter's day, when the yellow fog hung so thick and</p>\n<p>heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted and the shop</p>\n<p>windows blazed with gas as they do at night, an odd-looking little girl</p>\n<p>sat in a cab with her father and was driven rather slowly through the</p>\n<p>big thoroughfares.</p>\n",
        "<p>She sat with her feet tucked under her, and leaned against her father,</p>\n<p>who held her in his arm, as she stared out of the window at the passing</p>\n<p>people with a queer old-fashioned thoughtfulness in her big eyes.</p>\n<p>She was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look</p>\n<p>on her small face.</p>\n<p>It would have been an old look for a child of</p>\n<p>twelve, and Sara Crewe was only seven.</p>\n<p>The fact was, however, that she</p>\n<p>was always dreaming and thinking odd things and could not herself</p>\n",
        "<p>remember any time when she had not been thinking things about grown-up</p>\n<p>people and the world they belonged to.</p>\n<p>She felt as if she had lived a</p>\n<p>long, long time.</p>\n<p>At this moment she was remembering the voyage she had just made from</p>\n<p>Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe.</p>\n<p>She was thinking of the big</p>\n<p>ship, of the Lascars passing silently to and fro on it, of the children</p>\n<p>playing about on the hot deck, and of some young officers' wives who</p>\n",
        "<p>used to try to make her talk to them and laugh at the things she said.</p>\n<p>Principally, she was thinking of what a queer thing it was that at one</p>\n<p>time one was in India in the blazing sun, and then in the middle of the</p>\n<p>ocean, and then driving in a strange vehicle through strange streets</p>\n<p>where the day was as dark as the night.</p>\n<p>She found this so puzzling</p>\n<p>that she moved closer to her father.</p>\n<p>\"Papa,\" she said in a low, mysterious little voice which was almost a</p>\n<p>whisper, \"papa.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"What is it, darling?\"  Captain Crewe answered, holding her closer and</p>\n<p>looking down into her face.</p>\n<p>\"What is Sara thinking of?\"</p>\n<p>\"Is this the place?\"  Sara whispered, cuddling still closer to him.</p>\n<p>\"Is</p>\n<p>it, papa?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, little Sara, it is.</p>\n<p>We have reached it at last.\"  And though she</p>\n<p>was only seven years old, she knew that he felt sad when he said it.</p>\n",
        "<p>It seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her mind for</p>\n<p>\"the place,\" as she always called it.</p>\n<p>Her mother had died when she was</p>\n<p>born, so she had never known or missed her.</p>\n<p>Her young, handsome, rich,</p>\n<p>petting father seemed to be the only relation she had in the world.</p>\n<p>They had always played together and been fond of each other.</p>\n<p>She only</p>\n<p>knew he was rich because she had heard people say so when they thought</p>\n",
        "<p>she was not listening, and she had also heard them say that when she</p>\n<p>grew up she would be rich, too.</p>\n<p>She did not know all that being rich</p>\n<p>meant.</p>\n<p>She had always lived in a beautiful bungalow, and had been used</p>\n<p>to seeing many servants who made salaams to her and called her \"Missee</p>\n<p>Sahib,\" and gave her her own way in everything.</p>\n<p>She had had toys and</p>\n<p>pets and an ayah who worshipped her, and she had gradually learned that</p>\n",
        "<p>people who were rich had these things.</p>\n<p>That, however, was all she knew</p>\n<p>about it.</p>\n<p>During her short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing</p>\n<p>was \"the place\" she was to be taken to some day.</p>\n<p>The climate of India</p>\n<p>was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away</p>\n<p>from it--generally to England and to school.</p>\n<p>She had seen other</p>\n",
        "<p>children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about</p>\n<p>the letters they received from them.</p>\n<p>She had known that she would be</p>\n<p>obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father's stories of the</p>\n<p>voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by</p>\n<p>the thought that he could not stay with her.</p>\n<p>\"Couldn't you go to that place with me, papa?\" she had asked when she</p>\n<p>was five years old.</p>\n<p>\"Couldn't you go to school, too?</p>\n",
        "<p>I would help you</p>\n<p>with your lessons.\"</p>\n<p>\"But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little Sara,\" he</p>\n<p>had always said.</p>\n<p>\"You will go to a nice house where there will be a</p>\n<p>lot of little girls, and you will play together, and I will send you</p>\n<p>plenty of books, and you will grow so fast that it will seem scarcely a</p>\n<p>year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take</p>\n<p>care of papa.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>She had liked to think of that.</p>\n<p>To keep the house for her father; to</p>\n<p>ride with him, and sit at the head of his table when he had dinner</p>\n<p>parties; to talk to him and read his books--that would be what she</p>\n<p>would like most in the world, and if one must go away to \"the place\" in</p>\n<p>England to attain it, she must make up her mind to go.</p>\n<p>She did not care</p>\n<p>very much for other little girls, but if she had plenty of books she</p>\n<p>could console herself.</p>\n",
        "<p>She liked books more than anything else, and</p>\n<p>was, in fact, always inventing stories of beautiful things and telling</p>\n<p>them to herself.</p>\n<p>Sometimes she had told them to her father, and he had</p>\n<p>liked them as much as she did.</p>\n<p>\"Well, papa,\" she said softly, \"if we are here I suppose we must be</p>\n<p>resigned.\"</p>\n<p>He laughed at her old-fashioned speech and kissed her.</p>\n<p>He was really</p>\n",
        "<p>not at all resigned himself, though he knew he must keep that a secret.</p>\n<p>His quaint little Sara had been a great companion to him, and he felt</p>\n<p>he should be a lonely fellow when, on his return to India, he went into</p>\n<p>his bungalow knowing he need not expect to see the small figure in its</p>\n<p>white frock come forward to meet him.</p>\n<p>So he held her very closely in</p>\n<p>his arms as the cab rolled into the big, dull square in which stood the</p>\n<p>house which was their destination.</p>\n<p>It was a big, dull, brick house, exactly like all the others in its</p>\n",
        "<p>row, but that on the front door there shone a brass plate on which was</p>\n<p>engraved in black letters:</p>\n<p>MISS MINCHIN,</p>\n<p>Select Seminary for Young Ladies.</p>\n<p>\"Here we are, Sara,\" said Captain Crewe, making his voice sound as</p>\n<p>cheerful as possible.</p>\n<p>Then he lifted her out of the cab and they</p>\n<p>mounted the steps and rang the bell.</p>\n<p>Sara often thought afterward that</p>\n",
        "<p>the house was somehow exactly like Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>It was respectable</p>\n<p>and well furnished, but everything in it was ugly; and the very</p>\n<p>armchairs seemed to have hard bones in them.</p>\n<p>In the hall everything</p>\n<p>was hard and polished--even the red cheeks of the moon face on the tall</p>\n<p>clock in the corner had a severe varnished look.</p>\n<p>The drawing room into</p>\n<p>which they were ushered was covered by a carpet with a square pattern</p>\n",
        "<p>upon it, the chairs were square, and a heavy marble timepiece stood</p>\n<p>upon the heavy marble mantel.</p>\n<p>As she sat down in one of the stiff mahogany chairs, Sara cast one of</p>\n<p>her quick looks about her.</p>\n<p>\"I don't like it, papa,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"But then I dare say soldiers--even</p>\n<p>brave ones--don't really LIKE going into battle.\"</p>\n<p>Captain Crewe laughed outright at this.</p>\n<p>He was young and full of fun,</p>\n",
        "<p>and he never tired of hearing Sara's queer speeches.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, little Sara,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"What shall I do when I have no one to say</p>\n<p>solemn things to me?</p>\n<p>No one else is as solemn as you are.\"</p>\n<p>\"But why do solemn things make you laugh so?\" inquired Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Because you are such fun when you say them,\" he answered, laughing</p>\n<p>still more.</p>\n<p>And then suddenly he swept her into his arms and kissed</p>\n",
        "<p>her very hard, stopping laughing all at once and looking almost as if</p>\n<p>tears had come into his eyes.</p>\n<p>It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room.</p>\n<p>She was very like</p>\n<p>her house, Sara felt: tall and dull, and respectable and ugly.</p>\n<p>She had</p>\n<p>large, cold, fishy eyes, and a large, cold, fishy smile.</p>\n<p>It spread</p>\n<p>itself into a very large smile when she saw Sara and Captain Crewe.</p>\n",
        "<p>She had heard a great many desirable things of the young soldier from</p>\n<p>the lady who had recommended her school to him.</p>\n<p>Among other things, she</p>\n<p>had heard that he was a rich father who was willing to spend a great</p>\n<p>deal of money on his little daughter.</p>\n<p>\"It will be a great privilege to have charge of such a beautiful and</p>\n<p>promising child, Captain Crewe,\" she said, taking Sara's hand and</p>\n<p>stroking it.</p>\n<p>\"Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness.</p>\n",
        "<h3>A</h3>\n<p>clever child is a great treasure in an establishment like mine.\"</p>\n<p>Sara stood quietly, with her eyes fixed upon Miss Minchin's face.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>was thinking something odd, as usual.</p>\n<p>\"Why does she say I am a beautiful child?\" she was thinking.</p>\n<p>\"I am not</p>\n<p>beautiful at all.</p>\n<p>Colonel Grange's little girl, Isobel, is beautiful.</p>\n",
        "<p>She has dimples and rose-colored cheeks, and long hair the color of</p>\n<p>gold.</p>\n<p>I have short black hair and green eyes; besides which, I am a</p>\n<p>thin child and not fair in the least.</p>\n<p>I am one of the ugliest children</p>\n<p>I ever saw.</p>\n<p>She is beginning by telling a story.\"</p>\n<p>She was mistaken, however, in thinking she was an ugly child.</p>\n<p>She was</p>\n",
        "<p>not in the least like Isobel Grange, who had been the beauty of the</p>\n<p>regiment, but she had an odd charm of her own.</p>\n<p>She was a slim, supple</p>\n<p>creature, rather tall for her age, and had an intense, attractive</p>\n<p>little face.</p>\n<p>Her hair was heavy and quite black and only curled at the</p>\n<p>tips; her eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big,</p>\n<p>wonderful eyes with long, black lashes, and though she herself did not</p>\n<p>like the color of them, many other people did.</p>\n",
        "<p>Still she was very firm</p>\n<p>in her belief that she was an ugly little girl, and she was not at all</p>\n<p>elated by Miss Minchin's flattery.</p>\n<p>\"I should be telling a story if I said she was beautiful,\" she thought;</p>\n<p>\"and I should know I was telling a story.</p>\n<p>I believe I am as ugly as</p>\n<p>she is--in my way.</p>\n<p>What did she say that for?\"</p>\n<p>After she had known Miss Minchin longer she learned why she had said</p>\n",
        "<p>it.</p>\n<p>She discovered that she said the same thing to each papa and mamma</p>\n<p>who brought a child to her school.</p>\n<p>Sara stood near her father and listened while he and Miss Minchin</p>\n<p>talked.</p>\n<p>She had been brought to the seminary because Lady Meredith's</p>\n<p>two little girls had been educated there, and Captain Crewe had a great</p>\n<p>respect for Lady Meredith's experience.</p>\n<p>Sara was to be what was known</p>\n",
        "<p>as \"a parlor boarder,\" and she was to enjoy even greater privileges</p>\n<p>than parlor boarders usually did.</p>\n<p>She was to have a pretty bedroom and</p>\n<p>sitting room of her own; she was to have a pony and a carriage, and a</p>\n<p>maid to take the place of the ayah who had been her nurse in India.</p>\n<p>\"I am not in the least anxious about her education,\" Captain Crewe</p>\n<p>said, with his gay laugh, as he held Sara's hand and patted it.</p>\n<p>\"The</p>\n<p>difficulty will be to keep her from learning too fast and too much.</p>\n",
        "<p>She is always sitting with her little nose burrowing into books.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>doesn't read them, Miss Minchin; she gobbles them up as if she were a</p>\n<p>little wolf instead of a little girl.</p>\n<p>She is always starving for new</p>\n<p>books to gobble, and she wants grown-up books--great, big, fat</p>\n<p>ones--French and German as well as English--history and biography and</p>\n<p>poets, and all sorts of things.</p>\n<p>Drag her away from her books when she</p>\n",
        "<p>reads too much.</p>\n<p>Make her ride her pony in the Row or go out and buy a</p>\n<p>new doll.</p>\n<p>She ought to play more with dolls.\"</p>\n<p>\"Papa,\" said Sara, \"you see, if I went out and bought a new doll every</p>\n<p>few days I should have more than I could be fond of.</p>\n<p>Dolls ought to be</p>\n<p>intimate friends.</p>\n<p>Emily is going to be my intimate friend.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Captain Crewe looked at Miss Minchin and Miss Minchin looked at Captain</p>\n<p>Crewe.</p>\n<p>\"Who is Emily?\" she inquired.</p>\n<p>\"Tell her, Sara,\" Captain Crewe said, smiling.</p>\n<p>Sara's green-gray eyes looked very solemn and quite soft as she</p>\n<p>answered.</p>\n<p>\"She is a doll I haven't got yet,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"She is a doll papa is</p>\n<p>going to buy for me.</p>\n",
        "<p>We are going out together to find her.</p>\n<p>I have</p>\n<p>called her Emily.</p>\n<p>She is going to be my friend when papa is gone.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>want her to talk to about him.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin's large, fishy smile became very flattering indeed.</p>\n<p>\"What an original child!\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"What a darling little creature!\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Yes,\" said Captain Crewe, drawing Sara close.</p>\n<p>\"She is a darling</p>\n<p>little creature.</p>\n<p>Take great care of her for me, Miss Minchin.\"</p>\n<p>Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days; in fact, she</p>\n<p>remained with him until he sailed away again to India.</p>\n<p>They went out</p>\n<p>and visited many big shops together, and bought a great many things.</p>\n<p>They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed; but</p>\n",
        "<p>Captain Crewe was a rash, innocent young man and wanted his little girl</p>\n<p>to have everything she admired and everything he admired himself, so</p>\n<p>between them they collected a wardrobe much too grand for a child of</p>\n<p>seven.</p>\n<p>There were velvet dresses trimmed with costly furs, and lace</p>\n<p>dresses, and embroidered ones, and hats with great, soft ostrich</p>\n<p>feathers, and ermine coats and muffs, and boxes of tiny gloves and</p>\n<p>handkerchiefs and silk stockings in such abundant supplies that the</p>\n<p>polite young women behind the counters whispered to each other that the</p>\n",
        "<p>odd little girl with the big, solemn eyes must be at least some foreign</p>\n<p>princess--perhaps the little daughter of an Indian rajah.</p>\n<p>And at last they found Emily, but they went to a number of toy shops</p>\n<p>and looked at a great many dolls before they discovered her.</p>\n<p>\"I want her to look as if she wasn't a doll really,\" Sara said.</p>\n<p>\"I</p>\n<p>want her to look as if she LISTENS when I talk to her.</p>\n<p>The trouble with</p>\n<p>dolls, papa\"--and she put her head on one side and reflected as she</p>\n",
        "<p>said it--\"the trouble with dolls is that they never seem to HEAR.\" So</p>\n<p>they looked at big ones and little ones--at dolls with black eyes and</p>\n<p>dolls with blue--at dolls with brown curls and dolls with golden</p>\n<p>braids, dolls dressed and dolls undressed.</p>\n<p>\"You see,\" Sara said when they were examining one who had no clothes.</p>\n<p>\"If, when I find her, she has no frocks, we can take her to a</p>\n<p>dressmaker and have her things made to fit.</p>\n<p>They will fit better if</p>\n<p>they are tried on.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>After a number of disappointments they decided to walk and look in at</p>\n<p>the shop windows and let the cab follow them.</p>\n<p>They had passed two or</p>\n<p>three places without even going in, when, as they were approaching a</p>\n<p>shop which was really not a very large one, Sara suddenly started and</p>\n<p>clutched her father's arm.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, papa!\" she cried.</p>\n<p>\"There is Emily!\"</p>\n<p>A flush had risen to her face and there was an expression in her</p>\n",
        "<p>green-gray eyes as if she had just recognized someone she was intimate</p>\n<p>with and fond of.</p>\n<p>\"She is actually waiting there for us!\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Let us go in to</p>\n<p>her.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dear me,\" said Captain Crewe, \"I feel as if we ought to have someone</p>\n<p>to introduce us.\"</p>\n<p>\"You must introduce me and I will introduce you,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"But I</p>\n",
        "<p>knew her the minute I saw her--so perhaps she knew me, too.\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps she had known her.</p>\n<p>She had certainly a very intelligent</p>\n<p>expression in her eyes when Sara took her in her arms.</p>\n<p>She was a large</p>\n<p>doll, but not too large to carry about easily; she had naturally</p>\n<p>curling golden-brown hair, which hung like a mantle about her, and her</p>\n<p>eyes were a deep, clear, gray-blue, with soft, thick eyelashes which</p>\n<p>were real eyelashes and not mere painted lines.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Of course,\" said Sara, looking into her face as she held her on her</p>\n<p>knee, \"of course papa, this is Emily.\"</p>\n<p>So Emily was bought and actually taken to a children's outfitter's shop</p>\n<p>and measured for a wardrobe as grand as Sara's own.</p>\n<p>She had lace</p>\n<p>frocks, too, and velvet and muslin ones, and hats and coats and</p>\n<p>beautiful lace-trimmed underclothes, and gloves and handkerchiefs and</p>\n<p>furs.</p>\n<p>\"I should like her always to look as if she was a child with a good</p>\n",
        "<p>mother,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I'm her mother, though I am going to make a</p>\n<p>companion of her.\"</p>\n<p>Captain Crewe would really have enjoyed the shopping tremendously, but</p>\n<p>that a sad thought kept tugging at his heart.</p>\n<p>This all meant that he</p>\n<p>was going to be separated from his beloved, quaint little comrade.</p>\n<p>He got out of his bed in the middle of that night and went and stood</p>\n<p>looking down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily in her arms.</p>\n",
        "<p>Her black</p>\n<p>hair was spread out on the pillow and Emily's golden-brown hair mingled</p>\n<p>with it, both of them had lace-ruffled nightgowns, and both had long</p>\n<p>eyelashes which lay and curled up on their cheeks.</p>\n<p>Emily looked so like</p>\n<p>a real child that Captain Crewe felt glad she was there.</p>\n<p>He drew a big</p>\n<p>sigh and pulled his mustache with a boyish expression.</p>\n<p>\"Heigh-ho, little Sara!\" he said to himself \"I don't believe you know</p>\n",
        "<p>how much your daddy will miss you.\"</p>\n<p>The next day he took her to Miss Minchin's and left her there.</p>\n<p>He was</p>\n<p>to sail away the next morning.</p>\n<p>He explained to Miss Minchin that his</p>\n<p>solicitors, Messrs.</p>\n<p>Barrow & Skipworth, had charge of his affairs in</p>\n<p>England and would give her any advice she wanted, and that they would</p>\n<p>pay the bills she sent in for Sara's expenses.</p>\n",
        "<p>He would write to Sara</p>\n<p>twice a week, and she was to be given every pleasure she asked for.</p>\n<p>\"She is a sensible little thing, and she never wants anything it isn't</p>\n<p>safe to give her,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Then he went with Sara into her little sitting room and they bade each</p>\n<p>other good-by.</p>\n<p>Sara sat on his knee and held the lapels of his coat in</p>\n<p>her small hands, and looked long and hard at his face.</p>\n<p>\"Are you learning me by heart, little Sara?\" he said, stroking her hair.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"No,\" she answered.</p>\n<p>\"I know you by heart.</p>\n<p>You are inside my heart.\"</p>\n<p>And they put their arms round each other and kissed as if they would</p>\n<p>never let each other go.</p>\n<p>When the cab drove away from the door, Sara was sitting on the floor of</p>\n<p>her sitting room, with her hands under her chin and her eyes following</p>\n<p>it until it had turned the corner of the square.</p>\n<p>Emily was sitting by</p>\n",
        "<p>her, and she looked after it, too.</p>\n<p>When Miss Minchin sent her sister,</p>\n<p>Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing, she found she could not</p>\n<p>open the door.</p>\n<p>\"I have locked it,\" said a queer, polite little voice from inside.</p>\n<p>\"I</p>\n<p>want to be quite by myself, if you please.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Amelia was fat and dumpy, and stood very much in awe of her</p>\n<p>sister.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was really the better-natured person of the two, but she</p>\n<p>never disobeyed Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>She went downstairs again, looking</p>\n<p>almost alarmed.</p>\n<p>\"I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned child, sister,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"She</p>\n<p>has locked herself in, and she is not making the least particle of</p>\n<p>noise.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is much better than if she kicked and screamed, as some of them</p>\n",

        "<p>speak French herself, and was desirous of concealing the irritating</p>\n<p>fact.</p>\n<p>She, therefore, had no intention of discussing the matter and</p>\n<p>laying herself open to innocent questioning by a new little pupil.</p>\n<p>\"That is enough,\" she said with polite tartness.</p>\n<p>\"If you have not</p>\n<p>learned, you must begin at once.</p>\n<p>The French master, Monsieur Dufarge,</p>\n<p>will be here in a few minutes.</p>\n",

        "<p>quite innocently appealing.</p>\n<p>She knew that he would understand as soon</p>\n<p>as she spoke.</p>\n<p>She began to explain quite simply in pretty and fluent</p>\n<p>French.</p>\n<p>Madame had not understood.</p>\n<p>She had not learned French</p>\n<p>exactly--not out of books--but her papa and other people had always</p>\n<p>spoken it to her, and she had read it and written it as she had read</p>\n",

        "<p>finished.</p>\n<p>Monsieur Dufarge began to smile, and his smile was one of</p>\n<p>great pleasure.</p>\n<p>To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own</p>\n<p>language so simply and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in</p>\n<p>his native land--which in dark, foggy days in London sometimes seemed</p>\n<p>worlds away.</p>\n<p>When she had finished, he took the phrase book from her,</p>\n<p>with a look almost affectionate.</p>\n",
        "<p>But he spoke to Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, madame,\" he said, \"there is not much I can teach her.</p>\n<p>She has not</p>\n<p>LEARNED French; she is French.</p>\n<p>Her accent is exquisite.\"</p>\n<p>\"You ought to have told me,\" exclaimed Miss Minchin, much mortified,</p>\n<p>turning to Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I--I tried,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I--I suppose I did not begin right.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Miss Minchin knew she had tried, and that it had not been her fault</p>\n<p>that she was not allowed to explain.</p>\n<p>And when she saw that the pupils</p>\n<p>had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were giggling behind</p>\n<p>their French grammars, she felt infuriated.</p>\n<p>\"Silence, young ladies!\" she said severely, rapping upon the desk.</p>\n<p>\"Silence at once!\"</p>\n<p>And she began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her show</p>\n<p>pupil.</p>\n",

        "<p>Her flaxen hair was braided in a tight</p>\n<p>pigtail, tied with a ribbon, and she had pulled this pigtail around her</p>\n<p>neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, resting her elbows on the</p>\n<p>desk, as she stared wonderingly at the new pupil.</p>\n<p>When Monsieur</p>\n<p>Dufarge began to speak to Sara, she looked a little frightened; and</p>\n<p>when Sara stepped forward and, looking at him with the innocent,</p>\n<p>appealing eyes, answered him, without any warning, in French, the fat</p>\n<p>little girl gave a startled jump, and grew quite red in her awed</p>\n",
        "<p>amazement.</p>\n<p>Having wept hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to</p>\n<p>remember that \"la mere\" meant \"the mother,\" and \"le pere,\" \"the</p>\n<p>father,\"--when one spoke sensible English--it was almost too much for</p>\n<p>her suddenly to find herself listening to a child her own age who</p>\n<p>seemed not only quite familiar with these words, but apparently knew</p>\n<p>any number of others, and could mix them up with verbs as if they were</p>\n<p>mere trifles.</p>\n<p>She stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her pigtail so fast that she</p>\n",
        "<p>attracted the attention of Miss Minchin, who, feeling extremely cross</p>\n<p>at the moment, immediately pounced upon her.</p>\n<p>\"Miss St.</p>\n<p>John!\" she exclaimed severely.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean by such</p>\n<p>conduct?</p>\n<p>Remove your elbows!</p>\n<p>Take your ribbon out of your mouth!</p>\n<p>Sit</p>\n",
        "<p>up at once!\"</p>\n<p>Upon which Miss St.</p>\n<p>John gave another jump, and when Lavinia and Jessie</p>\n<p>tittered she became redder than ever--so red, indeed, that she almost</p>\n<p>looked as if tears were coming into her poor, dull, childish eyes; and</p>\n<p>Sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began rather to like her</p>\n<p>and want to be her friend.</p>\n<p>It was a way of hers always to want to</p>\n<p>spring into any fray in which someone was made uncomfortable or unhappy.</p>\n",

        "<p>easy matter to her, and that there was no danger of her ever being</p>\n<p>spoiled by being treated as a show pupil.</p>\n<p>Her French lesson was a</p>\n<p>pathetic thing.</p>\n<p>Her pronunciation made even Monsieur Dufarge smile in</p>\n<p>spite of himself, and Lavinia and Jessie and the more fortunate girls</p>\n<p>either giggled or looked at her in wondering disdain.</p>\n<p>But Sara did not</p>\n<p>laugh.</p>\n",
        "<p>She tried to look as if she did not hear when Miss St.</p>\n<p>John</p>\n<p>called \"le bon pain,\" \"lee bong pang.\"  She had a fine, hot little</p>\n<p>temper of her own, and it made her feel rather savage when she heard</p>\n<p>the titters and saw the poor, stupid, distressed child's face.</p>\n<p>\"It isn't funny, really,\" she said between her teeth, as she bent over</p>\n<p>her book.</p>\n<p>\"They ought not to laugh.\"</p>\n<p>When lessons were over and the pupils gathered together in groups to</p>\n",
        "<p>talk, Sara looked for Miss St.</p>\n<p>John, and finding her bundled rather</p>\n<p>disconsolately in a window-seat, she walked over to her and spoke.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by</p>\n<p>way of beginning an acquaintance, but there was something friendly</p>\n<p>about Sara, and people always felt it.</p>\n<p>\"What is your name?\" she said.</p>\n<p>To explain Miss St.</p>\n",
        "<p>John's amazement one must recall that a new pupil</p>\n<p>is, for a short time, a somewhat uncertain thing; and of this new pupil</p>\n<p>the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep</p>\n<p>quite exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories.</p>\n<p>A new pupil</p>\n<p>with a carriage and a pony and a maid, and a voyage from India to</p>\n<p>discuss, was not an ordinary acquaintance.</p>\n<p>\"My name's Ermengarde St.</p>\n<p>John,\" she answered.</p>\n",

        "<p>John.</p>\n<p>He could not</p>\n<p>understand how a child of his could be a notably and unmistakably dull</p>\n<p>creature who never shone in anything.</p>\n<p>\"Good heavens!\" he had said more than once, as he stared at her, \"there</p>\n<p>are times when I think she is as stupid as her Aunt Eliza!\"</p>\n<p>If her Aunt Eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a thing</p>\n<p>entirely when she had learned it, Ermengarde was strikingly like her.</p>\n<p>She was the monumental dunce of the school, and it could not be denied.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"She must be MADE to learn,\" her father said to Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>Consequently Ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in disgrace</p>\n<p>or in tears.</p>\n<p>She learned things and forgot them; or, if she remembered</p>\n<p>them, she did not understand them.</p>\n<p>So it was natural that, having made</p>\n<p>Sara's acquaintance, she should sit and stare at her with profound</p>\n<p>admiration.</p>\n<p>\"You can speak French, can't you?\" she said respectfully.</p>\n",
        "<p>Sara got on to the window-seat, which was a big, deep one, and, tucking</p>\n<p>up her feet, sat with her hands clasped round her knees.</p>\n<p>\"I can speak it because I have heard it all my life,\" she answered.</p>\n<p>\"You could speak it if you had always heard it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, no, I couldn't,\" said Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"I NEVER could speak it!\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" inquired Sara, curiously.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde shook her head so that the pigtail wobbled.</p>\n<p>\"You heard me just now,\" she said.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I'm always like that.</p>\n<p>I can't SAY</p>\n<p>the words.</p>\n<p>They're so queer.\"</p>\n<p>She paused a moment, and then added with a touch of awe in her voice,</p>\n<p>\"You are CLEVER, aren't you?\"</p>\n<p>Sara looked out of the window into the dingy square, where the sparrows</p>\n<p>were hopping and twittering on the wet, iron railings and the sooty</p>\n<p>branches of the trees.</p>\n",
        "<p>She reflected a few moments.</p>\n<p>She had heard it</p>\n<p>said very often that she was \"clever,\" and she wondered if she was--and</p>\n<p>IF she was, how it had happened.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"I can't tell.\"  Then, seeing a mournful</p>\n<p>look on the round, chubby face, she gave a little laugh and changed the</p>\n<p>subject.</p>\n<p>\"Would you like to see Emily?\" she inquired.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Who is Emily?\"  Ermengarde asked, just as Miss Minchin had done.</p>\n<p>\"Come up to my room and see,\" said Sara, holding out her hand.</p>\n<p>They jumped down from the window-seat together, and went upstairs.</p>\n<p>\"Is it true,\" Ermengarde whispered, as they went through the hall--\"is</p>\n<p>it true that you have a playroom all to yourself?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Sara answered.</p>\n<p>\"Papa asked Miss Minchin to let me have one,</p>\n<p>because--well, it was because when I play I make up stories and tell</p>\n<p>them to myself, and I don't like people to hear me.</p>\n",
        "<p>It spoils it if I</p>\n<p>think people listen.\"</p>\n<p>They had reached the passage leading to Sara's room by this time, and</p>\n<p>Ermengarde stopped short, staring, and quite losing her breath.</p>\n<p>\"You MAKE up stories!\" she gasped.</p>\n<p>\"Can you do that--as well as speak</p>\n<p>French?</p>\n<p>CAN you?\"</p>\n<p>Sara looked at her in simple surprise.</p>\n",

        "<p>Whatsoever she meant, Ermengarde was sure it was</p>\n<p>something delightfully exciting.</p>\n<p>So, quite thrilled with expectation,</p>\n<p>she followed her on tiptoe along the passage.</p>\n<p>They made not the least</p>\n<p>noise until they reached the door.</p>\n<p>Then Sara suddenly turned the</p>\n<p>handle, and threw it wide open.</p>\n<p>Its opening revealed the room quite</p>\n",

        "<p>She was so bewitched by this odd, new companion that she actually</p>\n<p>stared at Sara instead of at Emily--notwithstanding that Emily was the</p>\n<p>most attractive doll person she had ever seen.</p>\n<p>\"Let us sit down,\" said Sara, \"and I will tell you.</p>\n<p>It's so easy that</p>\n<p>when you begin you can't stop.</p>\n<p>You just go on and on doing it always.</p>\n<p>And it's beautiful.</p>\n<p>Emily, you must listen.</p>\n",

        "<p>it had never occurred to you that you COULD love your father, that you</p>\n<p>would do anything desperate to avoid being left alone in his society</p>\n<p>for ten minutes.</p>\n<p>She was, indeed, greatly embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\"I--I scarcely ever see him,\" she stammered.</p>\n<p>\"He is always in the</p>\n<p>library--reading things.\"</p>\n<p>\"I love mine more than all the world ten times over,\" Sara said.</p>\n<p>\"That</p>\n",

        "<p>If Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she led at Miss</p>\n<p>Minchin's Select Seminary for the next few years would not have been at</p>\n<p>all good for her.</p>\n<p>She was treated more as if she were a distinguished</p>\n<p>guest at the establishment than as if she were a mere little girl.</p>\n<p>If</p>\n<p>she had been a self-opinionated, domineering child, she might have</p>\n<p>become disagreeable enough to be unbearable through being so much</p>\n<p>indulged and flattered.</p>\n",
        "<p>If she had been an indolent child, she would</p>\n<p>have learned nothing.</p>\n<p>Privately Miss Minchin disliked her, but she was</p>\n<p>far too worldly a woman to do or say anything which might make such a</p>\n<p>desirable pupil wish to leave her school.</p>\n<p>She knew quite well that if</p>\n<p>Sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was uncomfortable or unhappy,</p>\n<p>Captain Crewe would remove her at once.</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin's opinion was that</p>\n",
        "<p>if a child were continually praised and never forbidden to do what she</p>\n<p>liked, she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was so</p>\n<p>treated.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Sara was praised for her quickness at her</p>\n<p>lessons, for her good manners, for her amiability to her fellow pupils,</p>\n<p>for her generosity if she gave sixpence to a beggar out of her full</p>\n<p>little purse; the simplest thing she did was treated as if it were a</p>\n<p>virtue, and if she had not had a disposition and a clever little brain,</p>\n<p>she might have been a very self-satisfied young person.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the clever</p>\n<p>little brain told her a great many sensible and true things about</p>\n<p>herself and her circumstances, and now and then she talked these things</p>\n<p>over to Ermengarde as time went on.</p>\n<p>\"Things happen to people by accident,\" she used to say.</p>\n<p>\"A lot of nice</p>\n<p>accidents have happened to me.</p>\n<p>It just HAPPENED that I always liked</p>\n<p>lessons and books, and could remember things when I learned them.</p>\n",

        "<p>before.</p>\n<p>From that afternoon Sara was regarded as a goddess and a queen</p>\n<p>by the entire alphabet class.</p>\n<p>Lottie Legh worshipped her to such an extent that if Sara had not been</p>\n<p>a motherly person, she would have found her tiresome.</p>\n<p>Lottie had been</p>\n<p>sent to school by a rather flighty young papa who could not imagine</p>\n<p>what else to do with her.</p>\n<p>Her young mother had died, and as the child</p>\n",
        "<p>had been treated like a favorite doll or a very spoiled pet monkey or</p>\n<p>lap dog ever since the first hour of her life, she was a very appalling</p>\n<p>little creature.</p>\n<p>When she wanted anything or did not want anything she</p>\n<p>wept and howled; and, as she always wanted the things she could not</p>\n<p>have, and did not want the things that were best for her, her shrill</p>\n<p>little voice was usually to be heard uplifted in wails in one part of</p>\n<p>the house or another.</p>\n<p>Her strongest weapon was that in some mysterious way she had found out</p>\n",

        "<p>silenced.</p>\n<p>She refused so strenuously indeed that Miss Minchin was</p>\n<p>obliged to almost shout--in a stately and severe manner--to make</p>\n<p>herself heard.</p>\n<p>\"What IS she crying for?\" she almost yelled.</p>\n<p>\"Oh--oh--oh!\"  Sara heard; \"I haven't got any mam--ma-a!\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Lottie!\" screamed Miss Amelia.</p>\n<p>\"Do stop, darling!</p>\n<p>Don't cry!</p>\n",

        "<p>Lottie and might be able to quiet her.</p>\n<p>When Miss Minchin came out and</p>\n<p>saw her, she looked rather annoyed.</p>\n<p>She realized that her voice, as</p>\n<p>heard from inside the room, could not have sounded either dignified or</p>\n<p>amiable.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Sara!\" she exclaimed, endeavoring to produce a suitable smile.</p>\n<p>\"I stopped,\" explained Sara, \"because I knew it was Lottie--and I</p>\n<p>thought, perhaps--just perhaps, I could make her be quiet.</p>\n",

        "<p>And it was only another little girl.</p>\n<p>But it was the one who owned Emily and all the nice things.</p>\n<p>And she</p>\n<p>was looking at her steadily and as if she was merely thinking.</p>\n<p>Having</p>\n<p>paused for a few seconds to find this out, Lottie thought she must</p>\n<p>begin again, but the quiet of the room and of Sara's odd, interested</p>\n<p>face made her first howl rather half-hearted.</p>\n<p>\"I--haven't--any--ma--ma--ma-a!\" she announced; but her voice was not</p>\n",

        "<p>They can float anywhere they like.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city, but they are</p>\n<p>low enough for the people to go and lean on them, and look down onto</p>\n<p>the earth and smile, and send beautiful messages.\"</p>\n<p>Whatsoever story she had begun to tell, Lottie would, no doubt, have</p>\n<p>stopped crying, and been fascinated into listening; but there was no</p>\n<p>denying that this story was prettier than most others.</p>\n<p>She dragged</p>\n",
        "<p>herself close to Sara, and drank in every word until the end came--far</p>\n<p>too soon.</p>\n<p>When it did come, she was so sorry that she put up her lip</p>\n<p>ominously.</p>\n<p>\"I want to go there,\" she cried.</p>\n<p>\"I--haven't any mamma in this school.\"</p>\n<p>Sara saw the danger signal, and came out of her dream.</p>\n<p>She took hold</p>\n<p>of the chubby hand and pulled her close to her side with a coaxing</p>\n",
        "<p>little laugh.</p>\n<p>\"I will be your mamma,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"We will play that you are my little</p>\n<p>girl.</p>\n<p>And Emily shall be your sister.\"</p>\n<p>Lottie's dimples all began to show themselves.</p>\n<p>\"Shall she?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Sara, jumping to her feet.</p>\n<p>\"Let us go and tell her.</p>\n",
        "<p>And then I will wash your face and brush your hair.\"</p>\n<p>To which Lottie agreed quite cheerfully, and trotted out of the room</p>\n<p>and upstairs with her, without seeming even to remember that the whole</p>\n<p>of the last hour's tragedy had been caused by the fact that she had</p>\n<p>refused to be washed and brushed for lunch and Miss Minchin had been</p>\n<p>called in to use her majestic authority.</p>\n<p>And from that time Sara was an adopted mother.</p>\n<p>5</p>\n<p>Becky</p>\n",
        "<p>Of course the greatest power Sara possessed and the one which gained</p>\n<p>her even more followers than her luxuries and the fact that she was</p>\n<p>\"the show pupil,\" the power that Lavinia and certain other girls were</p>\n<p>most envious of, and at the same time most fascinated by in spite of</p>\n<p>themselves, was her power of telling stories and of making everything</p>\n<p>she talked about seem like a story, whether it was one or not.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has been at school with a teller of stories knows what the</p>\n<p>wonder means--how he or she is followed about and besought in a whisper</p>\n<p>to relate romances; how groups gather round and hang on the outskirts</p>\n",

        "<p>neck so that its wide-open eyes might peer at her through the railings.</p>\n<p>Something in the eagerness and timidity of the smudgy face made her</p>\n<p>look at it, and when she looked she smiled because it was her way to</p>\n<p>smile at people.</p>\n<p>But the owner of the smudgy face and the wide-open eyes evidently was</p>\n<p>afraid that she ought not to have been caught looking at pupils of</p>\n<p>importance.</p>\n<p>She dodged out of sight like a jack-in-the-box and</p>\n<p>scurried back into the kitchen, disappearing so suddenly that if she</p>\n",
        "<p>had not been such a poor little forlorn thing, Sara would have laughed</p>\n<p>in spite of herself.</p>\n<p>That very evening, as Sara was sitting in the</p>\n<p>midst of a group of listeners in a corner of the schoolroom telling one</p>\n<p>of her stories, the very same figure timidly entered the room, carrying</p>\n<p>a coal box much too heavy for her, and knelt down upon the hearth rug</p>\n<p>to replenish the fire and sweep up the ashes.</p>\n<p>She was cleaner than she had been when she peeped through the area</p>\n<p>railings, but she looked just as frightened.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was evidently afraid</p>\n<p>to look at the children or seem to be listening.</p>\n<p>She put on pieces of</p>\n<p>coal cautiously with her fingers so that she might make no disturbing</p>\n<p>noise, and she swept about the fire irons very softly.</p>\n<p>But Sara saw in</p>\n<p>two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on, and</p>\n<p>that she was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here</p>\n<p>and there.</p>\n",
        "<p>And realizing this, she raised her voice and spoke more</p>\n<p>clearly.</p>\n<p>\"The Mermaids swam softly about in the crystal-green water, and dragged</p>\n<p>after them a fishing-net woven of deep-sea pearls,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"The</p>\n<p>Princess sat on the white rock and watched them.\"</p>\n<p>It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a Prince</p>\n<p>Merman, and went to live with him in shining caves under the sea.</p>\n<p>The small drudge before the grate swept the hearth once and then swept</p>\n",
        "<p>it again.</p>\n<p>Having done it twice, she did it three times; and, as she</p>\n<p>was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so lured her to</p>\n<p>listen that she fell under the spell and actually forgot that she had</p>\n<p>no right to listen at all, and also forgot everything else.</p>\n<p>She sat</p>\n<p>down upon her heels as she knelt on the hearth rug, and the brush hung</p>\n<p>idly in her fingers.</p>\n<p>The voice of the storyteller went on and drew her</p>\n",
        "<p>with it into winding grottos under the sea, glowing with soft, clear</p>\n<p>blue light, and paved with pure golden sands.</p>\n<p>Strange sea flowers and</p>\n<p>grasses waved about her, and far away faint singing and music echoed.</p>\n<p>The hearth brush fell from the work-roughened hand, and Lavinia Herbert</p>\n<p>looked round.</p>\n<p>\"That girl has been listening,\" she said.</p>\n<p>The culprit snatched up her brush, and scrambled to her feet.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",
        "<p>caught at the coal box and simply scuttled out of the room like a</p>\n<p>frightened rabbit.</p>\n<p>Sara felt rather hot-tempered.</p>\n<p>\"I knew she was listening,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Why shouldn't she?\"</p>\n<p>Lavinia tossed her head with great elegance.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" she remarked, \"I do not know whether your mamma would like you</p>\n<p>to tell stories to servant girls, but I know MY mamma wouldn't like ME</p>\n<p>to do it.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"My mamma!\" said Sara, looking odd.</p>\n<p>\"I don't believe she would mind in</p>\n<p>the least.</p>\n<p>She knows that stories belong to everybody.\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought,\" retorted Lavinia, in severe recollection, \"that your mamma</p>\n<p>was dead.</p>\n<p>How can she know things?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think she DOESN'T know things?\" said Sara, in her stern little</p>\n<p>voice.</p>\n",
        "<p>Sometimes she had a rather stern little voice.</p>\n<p>\"Sara's mamma knows everything,\" piped in Lottie.</p>\n<p>\"So does my</p>\n<p>mamma--'cept Sara is my mamma at Miss Minchin's--my other one knows</p>\n<p>everything.</p>\n<p>The streets are shining, and there are fields and fields</p>\n<p>of lilies, and everybody gathers them.</p>\n<p>Sara tells me when she puts me</p>\n<p>to bed.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"You wicked thing,\" said Lavinia, turning on Sara; \"making fairy</p>\n<p>stories about heaven.\"</p>\n<p>\"There are much more splendid stories in Revelation,\" returned Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Just look and see!</p>\n<p>How do you know mine are fairy stories?</p>\n<p>But I can</p>\n<p>tell you\"--with a fine bit of unheavenly temper--\"you will never find</p>\n<p>out whether they are or not if you're not kinder to people than you are</p>\n<p>now.</p>\n",
        "<p>Come along, Lottie.\"  And she marched out of the room, rather</p>\n<p>hoping that she might see the little servant again somewhere, but she</p>\n<p>found no trace of her when she got into the hall.</p>\n<p>\"Who is that little girl who makes the fires?\" she asked Mariette that</p>\n<p>night.</p>\n<p>Mariette broke forth into a flow of description.</p>\n<p>Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle Sara might well ask.</p>\n<p>She was a forlorn little</p>\n<p>thing who had just taken the place of scullery maid--though, as to</p>\n",

        "<p>her poor, frightened eyes would jump out of her head.</p>\n<p>\"What is her name?\" asked Sara, who had sat by the table, with her chin</p>\n<p>on her hands, as she listened absorbedly to the recital.</p>\n<p>Her name was Becky.</p>\n<p>Mariette heard everyone below-stairs calling,</p>\n<p>\"Becky, do this,\" and \"Becky, do that,\" every five minutes in the day.</p>\n<p>Sara sat and looked into the fire, reflecting on Becky for some time</p>\n<p>after Mariette left her.</p>\n<p>She made up a story of which Becky was the</p>\n",
        "<p>ill-used heroine.</p>\n<p>She thought she looked as if she had never had quite</p>\n<p>enough to eat.</p>\n<p>Her very eyes were hungry.</p>\n<p>She hoped she should see</p>\n<p>her again, but though she caught sight of her carrying things up or</p>\n<p>down stairs on several occasions, she always seemed in such a hurry and</p>\n<p>so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her.</p>\n<p>But a few weeks later, on another foggy afternoon, when she entered her</p>\n",

        "<p>and she fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>She had really been only about ten minutes</p>\n<p>in the room when Sara entered, but she was in as deep a sleep as if she</p>\n<p>had been, like the Sleeping Beauty, slumbering for a hundred years.</p>\n<p>But she did not look--poor Becky--like a Sleeping Beauty at all.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>looked only like an ugly, stunted, worn-out little scullery drudge.</p>\n<p>Sara seemed as much unlike her as if she were a creature from another</p>\n<p>world.</p>\n",
        "<p>On this particular afternoon she had been taking her dancing lesson,</p>\n<p>and the afternoon on which the dancing master appeared was rather a</p>\n<p>grand occasion at the seminary, though it occurred every week.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>pupils were attired in their prettiest frocks, and as Sara danced</p>\n<p>particularly well, she was very much brought forward, and Mariette was</p>\n<p>requested to make her as diaphanous and fine as possible.</p>\n<p>Today a frock the color of a rose had been put on her, and Mariette had</p>\n<p>bought some real buds and made her a wreath to wear on her black locks.</p>\n",
        "<p>She had been learning a new, delightful dance in which she had been</p>\n<p>skimming and flying about the room, like a large rose-colored</p>\n<p>butterfly, and the enjoyment and exercise had brought a brilliant,</p>\n<p>happy glow into her face.</p>\n<p>When she entered the room, she floated in with a few of the butterfly</p>\n<p>steps--and there sat Becky, nodding her cap sideways off her head.</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" cried Sara, softly, when she saw her.</p>\n<p>\"That poor thing!\"</p>\n<p>It did not occur to her to feel cross at finding her pet chair occupied</p>\n",

        "<p>friend of his school days, he had given him an opportunity to share in</p>\n<p>this enormous fortune by becoming a partner in his scheme.</p>\n<p>This, at</p>\n<p>least, was what Sara gathered from his letters.</p>\n<p>It is true that any</p>\n<p>other business scheme, however magnificent, would have had but small</p>\n<p>attraction for her or for the schoolroom; but \"diamond mines\" sounded</p>\n<p>so like the Arabian Nights that no one could be indifferent.</p>\n<p>Sara</p>\n",
        "<p>thought them enchanting, and painted pictures, for Ermengarde and</p>\n<p>Lottie, of labyrinthine passages in the bowels of the earth, where</p>\n<p>sparkling stones studded the walls and roofs and ceilings, and strange,</p>\n<p>dark men dug them out with heavy picks.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde delighted in the</p>\n<p>story, and Lottie insisted on its being retold to her every evening.</p>\n<p>Lavinia was very spiteful about it, and told Jessie that she didn't</p>\n<p>believe such things as diamond mines existed.</p>\n<p>\"My mamma has a diamond ring which cost forty pounds,\" she said.</p>\n",

        "<p>It happened that Lottie had been seized with a sudden desire to play in</p>\n<p>the schoolroom, and had begged her adopted parent to come with her.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner.</p>\n<p>Sara curled</p>\n<p>herself up in the window-seat, opened a book, and began to read.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>was a book about the French Revolution, and she was soon lost in a</p>\n<p>harrowing picture of the prisoners in the Bastille--men who had spent</p>\n",

        "<p>\"Stop this minute, you cry-baby!</p>\n<p>Stop this minute!\"  Lavinia commanded.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not a cry-baby ...</p>\n<p>I'm not!\" wailed Lottie.</p>\n<p>\"Sara, Sa--ra!\"</p>\n<p>\"If she doesn't stop, Miss Minchin will hear her,\" cried Jessie.</p>\n<p>\"Lottie darling, I'll give you a penny!\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want your penny,\" sobbed Lottie; and she looked down at the</p>\n<p>fat knee, and, seeing a drop of blood on it, burst forth again.</p>\n",

        "<p>Several</p>\n<p>times she had found that she could not think of a satisfactory reply</p>\n<p>when she was dealing with Sara.</p>\n<p>The reason for this was that, somehow,</p>\n<p>the rest always seemed to be vaguely in sympathy with her opponent.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>saw now that they were pricking up their ears interestedly.</p>\n<p>The truth</p>\n<p>was, they liked princesses, and they all hoped they might hear</p>\n",

        "<p>The</p>\n<p>acquaintance begun on the foggy afternoon when she had jumped up</p>\n<p>terrified from her sleep in the comfortable chair, had ripened and</p>\n<p>grown, though it must be confessed that Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia</p>\n<p>knew very little about it.</p>\n<p>They were aware that Sara was \"kind\" to the</p>\n<p>scullery maid, but they knew nothing of certain delightful moments</p>\n<p>snatched perilously when, the upstairs rooms being set in order with</p>\n<p>lightning rapidity, Sara's sitting room was reached, and the heavy coal</p>\n",

        "<p>\"Well,\" hesitated Sara, \"I don't think it would be good if they stayed</p>\n<p>always, but I do believe they will be satisfying.\"</p>\n<p>They were satisfying--and so were beef sandwiches, bought at a</p>\n<p>cook-shop--and so were rolls and Bologna sausage.</p>\n<p>In time, Becky began</p>\n<p>to lose her hungry, tired feeling, and the coal box did not seem so</p>\n<p>unbearably heavy.</p>\n<p>However heavy it was, and whatsoever the temper of the cook, and the</p>\n<p>hardness of the work heaped upon her shoulders, she had always the</p>\n",

        "<p>Becky gave a hysteric but joyful sniff, and her eyes looked quite moist</p>\n<p>with delight.</p>\n<p>\"It ain't nothin' but flannin, an' the flannin ain't new; but I wanted</p>\n<p>to give yer somethin' an' I made it of nights.</p>\n<p>I knew yer could PRETEND</p>\n<p>it was satin with diamond pins in.</p>\n<p>_I_ tried to when I was makin' it.</p>\n<p>The card, miss,\" rather doubtfully; \"'t warn't wrong of me to pick it</p>\n<p>up out o' the dust-bin, was it?</p>\n",
        "<p>Miss 'Meliar had throwed it away.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>hadn't no card o' my own, an' I knowed it wouldn't be a proper presink</p>\n<p>if I didn't pin a card on--so I pinned Miss 'Meliar's.\"</p>\n<p>Sara flew at her and hugged her.</p>\n<p>She could not have told herself or</p>\n<p>anyone else why there was a lump in her throat.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Becky!\" she cried out, with a queer little laugh, \"I love you,</p>\n<p>Becky--I do, I do!\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Oh, miss!\" breathed Becky.</p>\n<p>\"Thank yer, miss, kindly; it ain't good</p>\n<p>enough for that.</p>\n<p>The--the flannin wasn't new.\"</p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p>The Diamond Mines Again</p>\n<p>When Sara entered the holly-hung schoolroom in the afternoon, she did</p>\n<p>so as the head of a sort of procession.</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin, in her grandest</p>\n",
        "<p>silk dress, led her by the hand.</p>\n<p>A manservant followed, carrying the</p>\n<p>box containing the Last Doll, a housemaid carried a second box, and</p>\n<p>Becky brought up the rear, carrying a third and wearing a clean apron</p>\n<p>and a new cap.</p>\n<p>Sara would have much preferred to enter in the usual</p>\n<p>way, but Miss Minchin had sent for her, and, after an interview in her</p>\n<p>private sitting room, had expressed her wishes.</p>\n<p>\"This is not an ordinary occasion,\" she said.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I do not desire that it</p>\n<p>should be treated as one.\"</p>\n<p>So Sara was led grandly in and felt shy when, on her entry, the big</p>\n<p>girls stared at her and touched each other's elbows, and the little</p>\n<p>ones began to squirm joyously in their seats.</p>\n<p>\"Silence, young ladies!\" said Miss Minchin, at the murmur which arose.</p>\n<p>\"James, place the box on the table and remove the lid.</p>\n<p>Emma, put yours</p>\n<p>upon a chair.</p>\n",
        "<p>Becky!\" suddenly and severely.</p>\n<p>Becky had quite forgotten herself in her excitement, and was grinning</p>\n<p>at Lottie, who was wriggling with rapturous expectation.</p>\n<p>She almost</p>\n<p>dropped her box, the disapproving voice so startled her, and her</p>\n<p>frightened, bobbing curtsy of apology was so funny that Lavinia and</p>\n<p>Jessie tittered.</p>\n<p>\"It is not your place to look at the young ladies,\" said Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"You forget yourself.</p>\n",
        "<p>Put your box down.\"</p>\n<p>Becky obeyed with alarmed haste and hastily backed toward the door.</p>\n<p>\"You may leave us,\" Miss Minchin announced to the servants with a wave</p>\n<p>of her hand.</p>\n<p>Becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the superior servants to pass</p>\n<p>out first.</p>\n<p>She could not help casting a longing glance at the box on</p>\n<p>the table.</p>\n<p>Something made of blue satin was peeping from between the</p>\n",
        "<p>folds of tissue paper.</p>\n<p>\"If you please, Miss Minchin,\" said Sara, suddenly, \"mayn't Becky stay?\"</p>\n<p>It was a bold thing to do.</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin was betrayed into something</p>\n<p>like a slight jump.</p>\n<p>Then she put her eyeglass up, and gazed at her</p>\n<p>show pupil disturbedly.</p>\n<p>\"Becky!\" she exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\"My dearest Sara!\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Sara advanced a step toward her.</p>\n<p>\"I want her because I know she will like to see the presents,\" she</p>\n<p>explained.</p>\n<p>\"She is a little girl, too, you know.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin was scandalized.</p>\n<p>She glanced from one figure to the other.</p>\n<p>\"My dear Sara,\" she said, \"Becky is the scullery maid.</p>\n<p>Scullery</p>\n<p>maids--er--are not little girls.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>It really had not occurred to her to think of them in that light.</p>\n<p>Scullery maids were machines who carried coal scuttles and made fires.</p>\n<p>\"But Becky is,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"And I know she would enjoy herself.</p>\n<p>Please let her stay--because it is my birthday.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin replied with much dignity:</p>\n<p>\"As you ask it as a birthday favor--she may stay.</p>\n<p>Rebecca, thank Miss</p>\n<p>Sara for her great kindness.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Becky had been backing into the corner, twisting the hem of her apron</p>\n<p>in delighted suspense.</p>\n<p>She came forward, bobbing curtsies, but between</p>\n<p>Sara's eyes and her own there passed a gleam of friendly understanding,</p>\n<p>while her words tumbled over each other.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, if you please, miss!</p>\n<p>I'm that grateful, miss!</p>\n<p>I did want to see</p>\n<p>the doll, miss, that I did.</p>\n",
        "<p>Thank you, miss.</p>\n<p>And thank you,</p>\n<p>ma'am,\"--turning and making an alarmed bob to Miss Minchin--\"for</p>\n<p>letting me take the liberty.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin waved her hand again--this time it was in the direction of</p>\n<p>the corner near the door.</p>\n<p>\"Go and stand there,\" she commanded.</p>\n<p>\"Not too near the young ladies.\"</p>\n<p>Becky went to her place, grinning.</p>\n",
        "<p>She did not care where she was</p>\n<p>sent, so that she might have the luck of being inside the room, instead</p>\n<p>of being downstairs in the scullery, while these delights were going</p>\n<p>on.</p>\n<p>She did not even mind when Miss Minchin cleared her throat</p>\n<p>ominously and spoke again.</p>\n<p>\"Now, young ladies, I have a few words to say to you,\" she announced.</p>\n<p>\"She's going to make a speech,\" whispered one of the girls.</p>\n<p>\"I wish it</p>\n",
        "<p>was over.\"</p>\n<p>Sara felt rather uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>As this was her party, it was probable</p>\n<p>that the speech was about her.</p>\n<p>It is not agreeable to stand in a</p>\n<p>schoolroom and have a speech made about you.</p>\n<p>\"You are aware, young ladies,\" the speech began--for it was a</p>\n<p>speech--\"that dear Sara is eleven years old today.\"</p>\n<p>\"DEAR Sara!\" murmured Lavinia.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Several of you here have also been eleven years old, but Sara's</p>\n<p>birthdays are rather different from other little girls' birthdays.</p>\n<p>When</p>\n<p>she is older she will be heiress to a large fortune, which it will be</p>\n<p>her duty to spend in a meritorious manner.\"</p>\n<p>\"The diamond mines,\" giggled Jessie, in a whisper.</p>\n<p>Sara did not hear her; but as she stood with her green-gray eyes fixed</p>\n<p>steadily on Miss Minchin, she felt herself growing rather hot.</p>\n<p>When</p>\n",
        "<p>Miss Minchin talked about money, she felt somehow that she always hated</p>\n<p>her--and, of course, it was disrespectful to hate grown-up people.</p>\n<p>\"When her dear papa, Captain Crewe, brought her from India and gave her</p>\n<p>into my care,\" the speech proceeded, \"he said to me, in a jesting way,</p>\n<p>'I am afraid she will be very rich, Miss Minchin.' My reply was, 'Her</p>\n<p>education at my seminary, Captain Crewe, shall be such as will adorn</p>\n<p>the largest fortune.'  Sara has become my most accomplished pupil.</p>\n<p>Her</p>\n<p>French and her dancing are a credit to the seminary.</p>\n",
        "<p>Her</p>\n<p>manners--which have caused you to call her Princess Sara--are perfect.</p>\n<p>Her amiability she exhibits by giving you this afternoon's party.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>hope you appreciate her generosity.</p>\n<p>I wish you to express your</p>\n<p>appreciation of it by saying aloud all together, 'Thank you, Sara!'\"</p>\n<p>The entire schoolroom rose to its feet as it had done the morning Sara</p>\n<p>remembered so well.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Thank you, Sara!\" it said, and it must be confessed that Lottie jumped</p>\n<p>up and down.</p>\n<p>Sara looked rather shy for a moment.</p>\n<p>She made a</p>\n<p>curtsy--and it was a very nice one.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" she said, \"for coming to my party.\"</p>\n<p>\"Very pretty, indeed, Sara,\" approved Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"That is what a</p>\n<p>real princess does when the populace applauds her.</p>\n",
        "<p>Lavinia\"--scathingly--\"the sound you just made was extremely like a</p>\n<p>snort.</p>\n<p>If you are jealous of your fellow-pupil, I beg you will express</p>\n<p>your feelings in some more lady-like manner.</p>\n<p>Now I will leave you to</p>\n<p>enjoy yourselves.\"</p>\n<p>The instant she had swept out of the room the spell her presence always</p>\n<p>had upon them was broken.</p>\n<p>The door had scarcely closed before every</p>\n",
        "<p>seat was empty.</p>\n<p>The little girls jumped or tumbled out of theirs; the</p>\n<p>older ones wasted no time in deserting theirs.</p>\n<p>There was a rush toward</p>\n<p>the boxes.</p>\n<p>Sara had bent over one of them with a delighted face.</p>\n<p>\"These are books, I know,\" she said.</p>\n<p>The little children broke into a rueful murmur, and Ermengarde looked</p>\n<p>aghast.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Does your papa send you books for a birthday present?\" she exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\"Why, he's as bad as mine.</p>\n<p>Don't open them, Sara.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like them,\" Sara laughed, but she turned to the biggest box.</p>\n<p>When</p>\n<p>she took out the Last Doll it was so magnificent that the children</p>\n<p>uttered delighted groans of joy, and actually drew back to gaze at it</p>\n<p>in breathless rapture.</p>\n<p>\"She is almost as big as Lottie,\" someone gasped.</p>\n",
        "<p>Lottie clapped her hands and danced about, giggling.</p>\n<p>\"She's dressed for the theater,\" said Lavinia.</p>\n<p>\"Her cloak is lined</p>\n<p>with ermine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" cried Ermengarde, darting forward, \"she has an opera-glass in her</p>\n<p>hand--a blue-and-gold one!\"</p>\n<p>\"Here is her trunk,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Let us open it and look at her</p>\n<p>things.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>She sat down upon the floor and turned the key.</p>\n<p>The children crowded</p>\n<p>clamoring around her, as she lifted tray after tray and revealed their</p>\n<p>contents.</p>\n<p>Never had the schoolroom been in such an uproar.</p>\n<p>There were</p>\n<p>lace collars and silk stockings and handkerchiefs; there was a jewel</p>\n<p>case containing a necklace and a tiara which looked quite as if they</p>\n<p>were made of real diamonds; there was a long sealskin and muff, there</p>\n",
        "<p>were ball dresses and walking dresses and visiting dresses; there were</p>\n<p>hats and tea gowns and fans.</p>\n<p>Even Lavinia and Jessie forgot that they</p>\n<p>were too elderly to care for dolls, and uttered exclamations of delight</p>\n<p>and caught up things to look at them.</p>\n<p>\"Suppose,\" Sara said, as she stood by the table, putting a large,</p>\n<p>black-velvet hat on the impassively smiling owner of all these</p>\n<p>splendors--\"suppose she understands human talk and feels proud of being</p>\n<p>admired.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"You are always supposing things,\" said Lavinia, and her air was very</p>\n<p>superior.</p>\n<p>\"I know I am,\" answered Sara, undisturbedly.</p>\n<p>\"I like it.</p>\n<p>There is</p>\n<p>nothing so nice as supposing.</p>\n<p>It's almost like being a fairy.</p>\n<p>If you</p>\n<p>suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"It's all very well to suppose things if you have everything,\" said</p>\n<p>Lavinia.</p>\n<p>\"Could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar and lived</p>\n<p>in a garret?\"</p>\n<p>Sara stopped arranging the Last Doll's ostrich plumes, and looked</p>\n<p>thoughtful.</p>\n<p>\"I BELIEVE I could,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"If one was a beggar, one would have to</p>\n<p>suppose and pretend all the time.</p>\n",
        "<p>But it mightn't be easy.\"</p>\n<p>She often thought afterward how strange it was that just as she had</p>\n<p>finished saying this--just at that very moment--Miss Amelia came into</p>\n<p>the room.</p>\n<p>\"Sara,\" she said, \"your papa's solicitor, Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow, has called to see</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin, and, as she must talk to him alone and the refreshments</p>\n<p>are laid in her parlor, you had all better come and have your feast</p>\n<p>now, so that my sister can have her interview here in the schoolroom.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Refreshments were not likely to be disdained at any hour, and many</p>\n<p>pairs of eyes gleamed.</p>\n<p>Miss Amelia arranged the procession into</p>\n<p>decorum, and then, with Sara at her side heading it, she led it away,</p>\n<p>leaving the Last Doll sitting upon a chair with the glories of her</p>\n<p>wardrobe scattered about her; dresses and coats hung upon chair backs,</p>\n<p>piles of lace-frilled petticoats lying upon their seats.</p>\n<p>Becky, who was not expected to partake of refreshments, had the</p>\n<p>indiscretion to linger a moment to look at these beauties--it really</p>\n",
        "<p>was an indiscretion.</p>\n<p>\"Go back to your work, Becky,\" Miss Amelia had said; but she had</p>\n<p>stopped to pick up reverently first a muff and then a coat, and while</p>\n<p>she stood looking at them adoringly, she heard Miss Minchin upon the</p>\n<p>threshold, and, being smitten with terror at the thought of being</p>\n<p>accused of taking liberties, she rashly darted under the table, which</p>\n<p>hid her by its tablecloth.</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin came into the room, accompanied by a sharp-featured, dry</p>\n<p>little gentleman, who looked rather disturbed.</p>\n",
        "<p>Miss Minchin herself</p>\n<p>also looked rather disturbed, it must be admitted, and she gazed at the</p>\n<p>dry little gentleman with an irritated and puzzled expression.</p>\n<p>She sat down with stiff dignity, and waved him to a chair.</p>\n<p>\"Pray, be seated, Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow did not sit down at once.</p>\n<p>His attention seemed attracted by</p>\n",
        "<p>the Last Doll and the things which surrounded her.</p>\n<p>He settled his</p>\n<p>eyeglasses and looked at them in nervous disapproval.</p>\n<p>The Last Doll</p>\n<p>herself did not seem to mind this in the least.</p>\n<p>She merely sat upright</p>\n<p>and returned his gaze indifferently.</p>\n<p>\"A hundred pounds,\" Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow remarked succinctly.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"All expensive</p>\n<p>material, and made at a Parisian modiste's.</p>\n<p>He spent money lavishly</p>\n<p>enough, that young man.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin felt offended.</p>\n<p>This seemed to be a disparagement of her</p>\n<p>best patron and was a liberty.</p>\n<p>Even solicitors had no right to take liberties.</p>\n<p>\"I beg your pardon, Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Barrow,\" she said stiffly.</p>\n<p>\"I do not</p>\n<p>understand.\"</p>\n<p>\"Birthday presents,\" said Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow in the same critical manner, \"to a</p>\n<p>child eleven years old!</p>\n<p>Mad extravagance, I call it.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin drew herself up still more rigidly.</p>\n<p>\"Captain Crewe is a man of fortune,\" she said.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"The diamond mines</p>\n<p>alone--\"</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow wheeled round upon her.</p>\n<p>\"Diamond mines!\" he broke out.</p>\n<p>\"There are none!</p>\n<p>Never were!\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin actually got up from her chair.</p>\n<p>\"What!\" she cried.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"At any rate,\" answered Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow, quite snappishly, \"it would have</p>\n<p>been much better if there never had been any.\"</p>\n<p>\"Any diamond mines?\" ejaculated Miss Minchin, catching at the back of a</p>\n<p>chair and feeling as if a splendid dream was fading away from her.</p>\n<p>\"Diamond mines spell ruin oftener than they spell wealth,\" said Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow.</p>\n<p>\"When a man is in the hands of a very dear friend and is not a</p>\n",
        "<p>businessman himself, he had better steer clear of the dear friend's</p>\n<p>diamond mines, or gold mines, or any other kind of mines dear friends</p>\n<p>want his money to put into.</p>\n<p>The late Captain Crewe--\"</p>\n<p>Here Miss Minchin stopped him with a gasp.</p>\n<p>\"The LATE Captain Crewe!\" she cried out.</p>\n<p>\"The LATE!</p>\n<p>You don't come to</p>\n<p>tell me that Captain Crewe is--\"</p>\n",

        "<p>Miss Minchin dropped into her chair again.</p>\n<p>The words he had spoken</p>\n<p>filled her with alarm.</p>\n<p>\"What WERE his business troubles?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"What WERE they?\"</p>\n<p>\"Diamond mines,\" answered Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow, \"and dear friends--and ruin.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin lost her breath.</p>\n<p>\"Ruin!\" she gasped out.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Lost every penny.</p>\n<p>That young man had too much money.</p>\n<p>The dear friend</p>\n<p>was mad on the subject of the diamond mine.</p>\n<p>He put all his own money</p>\n<p>into it, and all Captain Crewe's.</p>\n<p>Then the dear friend ran</p>\n<p>away--Captain Crewe was already stricken with fever when the news came.</p>\n<p>The shock was too much for him.</p>\n",
        "<p>He died delirious, raving about his</p>\n<p>little girl--and didn't leave a penny.\"</p>\n<p>Now Miss Minchin understood, and never had she received such a blow in</p>\n<p>her life.</p>\n<p>Her show pupil, her show patron, swept away from the Select</p>\n<p>Seminary at one blow.</p>\n<p>She felt as if she had been outraged and robbed,</p>\n<p>and that Captain Crewe and Sara and Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow were equally to blame.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Do you mean to tell me,\" she cried out, \"that he left NOTHING!</p>\n<p>That</p>\n<p>Sara will have no fortune!</p>\n<p>That the child is a beggar!</p>\n<p>That she is</p>\n<p>left on my hands a little pauper instead of an heiress?\"</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow was a shrewd businessman, and felt it as well to make his</p>\n<p>own freedom from responsibility quite clear without any delay.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"She is certainly left a beggar,\" he replied.</p>\n<p>\"And she is certainly</p>\n<p>left on your hands, ma'am--as she hasn't a relation in the world that</p>\n<p>we know of.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin started forward.</p>\n<p>She looked as if she was going to open</p>\n<p>the door and rush out of the room to stop the festivities going on</p>\n<p>joyfully and rather noisily that moment over the refreshments.</p>\n<p>\"It is monstrous!\" she said.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"She's in my sitting room at this moment,</p>\n<p>dressed in silk gauze and lace petticoats, giving a party at my</p>\n<p>expense.\"</p>\n<p>\"She's giving it at your expense, madam, if she's giving it,\" said Mr.</p>\n<p>Barrow, calmly.</p>\n<p>\"Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible for anything.</p>\n<p>There never was a cleaner sweep made of a man's fortune.</p>\n<p>Captain Crewe</p>\n<p>died without paying OUR last bill--and it was a big one.\"</p>\n",

        "<p>in the life of quite another little girl.</p>\n<p>Every sign of the festivities had been swept away; the holly had been</p>\n<p>removed from the schoolroom walls, and the forms and desks put back</p>\n<p>into their places.</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin's sitting room looked as it always</p>\n<p>did--all traces of the feast were gone, and Miss Minchin had resumed</p>\n<p>her usual dress.</p>\n<p>The pupils had been ordered to lay aside their party</p>\n<p>frocks; and this having been done, they had returned to the schoolroom</p>\n",
        "<p>and huddled together in groups, whispering and talking excitedly.</p>\n<p>\"Tell Sara to come to my room,\" Miss Minchin had said to her sister.</p>\n<p>\"And explain to her clearly that I will have no crying or unpleasant</p>\n<p>scenes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sister,\" replied Miss Amelia, \"she is the strangest child I ever saw.</p>\n<p>She has actually made no fuss at all.</p>\n<p>You remember she made none when</p>\n<p>Captain Crewe went back to India.</p>\n<p>When I told her what had happened,</p>\n",
        "<p>she just stood quite still and looked at me without making a sound.</p>\n<p>Her eyes seemed to get bigger and bigger, and she went quite pale.</p>\n<p>When I had finished, she still stood staring for a few seconds, and</p>\n<p>then her chin began to shake, and she turned round and ran out of the</p>\n<p>room and upstairs.</p>\n<p>Several of the other children began to cry, but she</p>\n<p>did not seem to hear them or to be alive to anything but just what I</p>\n<p>was saying.</p>\n<p>It made me feel quite queer not to be answered; and when</p>\n",
        "<p>you tell anything sudden and strange, you expect people will say</p>\n<p>SOMETHING--whatever it is.\"</p>\n<p>Nobody but Sara herself ever knew what had happened in her room after</p>\n<p>she had run upstairs and locked her door.</p>\n<p>In fact, she herself</p>\n<p>scarcely remembered anything but that she walked up and down, saying</p>\n<p>over and over again to herself in a voice which did not seem her own,</p>\n<p>\"My papa is dead!</p>\n<p>My papa is dead!\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Once she stopped before Emily, who sat watching her from her chair, and</p>\n<p>cried out wildly, \"Emily!</p>\n<p>Do you hear?</p>\n<p>Do you hear--papa is dead?</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>is dead in India--thousands of miles away.\"</p>\n<p>When she came into Miss Minchin's sitting room in answer to her</p>\n<p>summons, her face was white and her eyes had dark rings around them.</p>\n<p>Her mouth was set as if she did not wish it to reveal what she had</p>\n",
        "<p>suffered and was suffering.</p>\n<p>She did not look in the least like the</p>\n<p>rose-colored butterfly child who had flown about from one of her</p>\n<p>treasures to the other in the decorated schoolroom.</p>\n<p>She looked instead</p>\n<p>a strange, desolate, almost grotesque little figure.</p>\n<p>She had put on, without Mariette's help, the cast-aside black-velvet</p>\n<p>frock.</p>\n<p>It was too short and tight, and her slender legs looked long</p>\n",
        "<p>and thin, showing themselves from beneath the brief skirt.</p>\n<p>As she had</p>\n<p>not found a piece of black ribbon, her short, thick, black hair tumbled</p>\n<p>loosely about her face and contrasted strongly with its pallor.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>held Emily tightly in one arm, and Emily was swathed in a piece of</p>\n<p>black material.</p>\n<p>\"Put down your doll,\" said Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean by bringing</p>\n",
        "<p>her here?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" Sara answered.</p>\n<p>\"I will not put her down.</p>\n<p>She is all I have.</p>\n<p>My</p>\n<p>papa gave her to me.\"</p>\n<p>She had always made Miss Minchin feel secretly uncomfortable, and she</p>\n<p>did so now.</p>\n<p>She did not speak with rudeness so much as with a cold</p>\n",
        "<p>steadiness with which Miss Minchin felt it difficult to cope--perhaps</p>\n<p>because she knew she was doing a heartless and inhuman thing.</p>\n<p>\"You will have no time for dolls in future,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"You will have</p>\n<p>to work and improve yourself and make yourself useful.\"</p>\n<p>Sara kept her big, strange eyes fixed on her, and said not a word.</p>\n<p>\"Everything will be very different now,\" Miss Minchin went on.</p>\n<p>\"I</p>\n<p>suppose Miss Amelia has explained matters to you.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Yes,\" answered Sara.</p>\n<p>\"My papa is dead.</p>\n<p>He left me no money.</p>\n<p>I am</p>\n<p>quite poor.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are a beggar,\" said Miss Minchin, her temper rising at the</p>\n<p>recollection of what all this meant.</p>\n<p>\"It appears that you have no</p>\n<p>relations and no home, and no one to take care of you.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>For a moment the thin, pale little face twitched, but Sara again said</p>\n<p>nothing.</p>\n<p>\"What are you staring at?\" demanded Miss Minchin, sharply.</p>\n<p>\"Are you so</p>\n<p>stupid that you cannot understand?</p>\n<p>I tell you that you are quite alone</p>\n<p>in the world, and have no one to do anything for you, unless I choose</p>\n<p>to keep you here out of charity.\"</p>\n<p>\"I understand,\" answered Sara, in a low tone; and there was a sound as</p>\n",
        "<p>if she had gulped down something which rose in her throat.</p>\n<p>\"I</p>\n<p>understand.\"</p>\n<p>\"That doll,\" cried Miss Minchin, pointing to the splendid birthday gift</p>\n<p>seated near--\"that ridiculous doll, with all her nonsensical,</p>\n<p>extravagant things--I actually paid the bill for her!\"</p>\n<p>Sara turned her head toward the chair.</p>\n<p>\"The Last Doll,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"The Last Doll.\"  And her little mournful</p>\n",
        "<p>voice had an odd sound.</p>\n<p>\"The Last Doll, indeed!\" said Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"And she is mine, not</p>\n<p>yours.</p>\n<p>Everything you own is mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Please take it away from me, then,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I do not want it.\"</p>\n<p>If she had cried and sobbed and seemed frightened, Miss Minchin might</p>\n<p>almost have had more patience with her.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was a woman who liked to</p>\n<p>domineer and feel her power, and as she looked at Sara's pale little</p>\n<p>steadfast face and heard her proud little voice, she quite felt as if</p>\n<p>her might was being set at naught.</p>\n<p>\"Don't put on grand airs,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"The time for that sort of thing</p>\n<p>is past.</p>\n<p>You are not a princess any longer.</p>\n<p>Your carriage and your</p>\n",

        "<p>What can I do?\"</p>\n<p>\"You can do anything you are told,\" was the answer.</p>\n<p>\"You are a sharp</p>\n<p>child, and pick up things readily.</p>\n<p>If you make yourself useful I may</p>\n<p>let you stay here.</p>\n<p>You speak French well, and you can help with the</p>\n<p>younger children.\"</p>\n<p>\"May I?\" exclaimed Sara.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Oh, please let me!</p>\n<p>I know I can teach them.</p>\n<p>I like them, and they like me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't talk nonsense about people liking you,\" said Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"You</p>\n<p>will have to do more than teach the little ones.</p>\n<p>You will run errands</p>\n<p>and help in the kitchen as well as in the schoolroom.</p>\n<p>If you don't</p>\n",
        "<p>please me, you will be sent away.</p>\n<p>Remember that.</p>\n<p>Now go.\"</p>\n<p>Sara stood still just a moment, looking at her.</p>\n<p>In her young soul, she</p>\n<p>was thinking deep and strange things.</p>\n<p>Then she turned to leave the</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>\"Stop!\" said Miss Minchin.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Don't you intend to thank me?\"</p>\n<p>Sara paused, and all the deep, strange thoughts surged up in her breast.</p>\n<p>\"What for?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"For my kindness to you,\" replied Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"For my kindness in</p>\n<p>giving you a home.\"</p>\n<p>Sara made two or three steps toward her.</p>\n<p>Her thin little chest heaved</p>\n<p>up and down, and she spoke in a strange un-childishly fierce way.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"You are not kind,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"You are NOT kind, and it is NOT a</p>\n<p>home.\"  And she had turned and run out of the room before Miss Minchin</p>\n<p>could stop her or do anything but stare after her with stony anger.</p>\n<p>She went up the stairs slowly, but panting for breath and she held</p>\n<p>Emily tightly against her side.</p>\n<p>\"I wish she could talk,\" she said to herself.</p>\n<p>\"If she could speak--if</p>\n<p>she could speak!\"</p>\n",
        "<p>She meant to go to her room and lie down on the tiger-skin, with her</p>\n<p>cheek upon the great cat's head, and look into the fire and think and</p>\n<p>think and think.</p>\n<p>But just before she reached the landing Miss Amelia</p>\n<p>came out of the door and closed it behind her, and stood before it,</p>\n<p>looking nervous and awkward.</p>\n<p>The truth was that she felt secretly</p>\n<p>ashamed of the thing she had been ordered to do.</p>\n<p>\"You--you are not to go in there,\" she said.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Not go in?\" exclaimed Sara, and she fell back a pace.</p>\n<p>\"That is not your room now,\" Miss Amelia answered, reddening a little.</p>\n<p>Somehow, all at once, Sara understood.</p>\n<p>She realized that this was the</p>\n<p>beginning of the change Miss Minchin had spoken of.</p>\n<p>\"Where is my room?\" she asked, hoping very much that her voice did not</p>\n<p>shake.</p>\n<p>\"You are to sleep in the attic next to Becky.\"</p>\n<p>Sara knew where it was.</p>\n",

        "<p>frock, climbing the stairs to the attic, was quite a different creature.</p>\n<p>When she reached the attic door and opened it, her heart gave a dreary</p>\n<p>little thump.</p>\n<p>Then she shut the door and stood against it and looked</p>\n<p>about her.</p>\n<p>Yes, this was another world.</p>\n<p>The room had a slanting roof and was</p>\n<p>whitewashed.</p>\n<p>The whitewash was dingy and had fallen off in places.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was a rusty grate, an old iron bedstead, and a hard bed covered</p>\n<p>with a faded coverlet.</p>\n<p>Some pieces of furniture too much worn to be</p>\n<p>used downstairs had been sent up.</p>\n<p>Under the skylight in the roof,</p>\n<p>which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky, there stood</p>\n<p>an old battered red footstool.</p>\n<p>Sara went to it and sat down.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",
        "<p>seldom cried.</p>\n<p>She did not cry now.</p>\n<p>She laid Emily across her knees</p>\n<p>and put her face down upon her and her arms around her, and sat there,</p>\n<p>her little black head resting on the black draperies, not saying one</p>\n<p>word, not making one sound.</p>\n<p>And as she sat in this silence there came a low tap at the door--such a</p>\n<p>low, humble one that she did not at first hear it, and, indeed, was not</p>\n<p>roused until the door was timidly pushed open and a poor tear-smeared</p>\n",
        "<p>face appeared peeping round it.</p>\n<p>It was Becky's face, and Becky had</p>\n<p>been crying furtively for hours and rubbing her eyes with her kitchen</p>\n<p>apron until she looked strange indeed.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, miss,\" she said under her breath.</p>\n<p>\"Might I--would you allow</p>\n<p>me--jest to come in?\"</p>\n<p>Sara lifted her head and looked at her.</p>\n<p>She tried to begin a smile,</p>\n",
        "<p>and somehow she could not.</p>\n<p>Suddenly--and it was all through the loving</p>\n<p>mournfulness of Becky's streaming eyes--her face looked more like a</p>\n<p>child's not so much too old for her years.</p>\n<p>She held out her hand and</p>\n<p>gave a little sob.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Becky,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"I told you we were just the same--only two</p>\n<p>little girls--just two little girls.</p>\n",

        "<p>Instead of being a sort of small royal</p>\n<p>personage among them, she no longer seemed to be one of their number at</p>\n<p>all.</p>\n<p>She was kept so constantly at work that she scarcely ever had an</p>\n<p>opportunity of speaking to any of them, and she could not avoid seeing</p>\n<p>that Miss Minchin preferred that she should live a life apart from that</p>\n<p>of the occupants of the schoolroom.</p>\n<p>\"I will not have her forming intimacies and talking to the other</p>\n<p>children,\" that lady said.</p>\n",

        "<p>She</p>\n<p>worked like a drudge; she tramped through the wet streets, carrying</p>\n<p>parcels and baskets; she labored with the childish inattention of the</p>\n<p>little ones' French lessons; as she became shabbier and more</p>\n<p>forlorn-looking, she was told that she had better take her meals</p>\n<p>downstairs; she was treated as if she was nobody's concern, and her</p>\n<p>heart grew proud and sore, but she never told anyone what she felt.</p>\n<p>\"Soldiers don't complain,\" she would say between her small, shut teeth,</p>\n<p>\"I am not going to do it; I will pretend this is part of a war.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>But there were hours when her child heart might almost have broken with</p>\n<p>loneliness but for three people.</p>\n<p>The first, it must be owned, was Becky--just Becky.</p>\n<p>Throughout all</p>\n<p>that first night spent in the garret, she had felt a vague comfort in</p>\n<p>knowing that on the other side of the wall in which the rats scuffled</p>\n<p>and squeaked there was another young human creature.</p>\n<p>And during the</p>\n<p>nights that followed the sense of comfort grew.</p>\n",
        "<p>They had little chance</p>\n<p>to speak to each other during the day.</p>\n<p>Each had her own tasks to</p>\n<p>perform, and any attempt at conversation would have been regarded as a</p>\n<p>tendency to loiter and lose time.</p>\n<p>\"Don't mind me, miss,\" Becky</p>\n<p>whispered during the first morning, \"if I don't say nothin' polite.</p>\n<p>Some un'd be down on us if I did.</p>\n<p>I MEANS 'please' an' 'thank you' an'</p>\n",

        "<p>some time passed before they saw each other much or exchanged visits.</p>\n<p>Becky's heart told her that it was best that people in trouble should</p>\n<p>be left alone.</p>\n<p>The second of the trio of comforters was Ermengarde, but odd things</p>\n<p>happened before Ermengarde found her place.</p>\n<p>When Sara's mind seemed to awaken again to the life about her, she</p>\n<p>realized that she had forgotten that an Ermengarde lived in the world.</p>\n<p>The two had always been friends, but Sara had felt as if she were years</p>\n<p>the older.</p>\n",
        "<p>It could not be contested that Ermengarde was as dull as</p>\n<p>she was affectionate.</p>\n<p>She clung to Sara in a simple, helpless way; she</p>\n<p>brought her lessons to her that she might be helped; she listened to</p>\n<p>her every word and besieged her with requests for stories.</p>\n<p>But she had</p>\n<p>nothing interesting to say herself, and she loathed books of every</p>\n<p>description.</p>\n<p>She was, in fact, not a person one would remember when</p>\n",
        "<p>one was caught in the storm of a great trouble, and Sara forgot her.</p>\n<p>It had been all the easier to forget her because she had been suddenly</p>\n<p>called home for a few weeks.</p>\n<p>When she came back she did not see Sara</p>\n<p>for a day or two, and when she met her for the first time she</p>\n<p>encountered her coming down a corridor with her arms full of garments</p>\n<p>which were to be taken downstairs to be mended.</p>\n<p>Sara herself had</p>\n<p>already been taught to mend them.</p>\n",
        "<p>She looked pale and unlike herself,</p>\n<p>and she was attired in the queer, outgrown frock whose shortness showed</p>\n<p>so much thin black leg.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde was too slow a girl to be equal to such a situation.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>could not think of anything to say.</p>\n<p>She knew what had happened, but,</p>\n<p>somehow, she had never imagined Sara could look like this--so odd and</p>\n<p>poor and almost like a servant.</p>\n",
        "<p>It made her quite miserable, and she</p>\n<p>could do nothing but break into a short hysterical laugh and</p>\n<p>exclaim--aimlessly and as if without any meaning, \"Oh, Sara, is that</p>\n<p>you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Sara, and suddenly a strange thought passed through her</p>\n<p>mind and made her face flush.</p>\n<p>She held the pile of garments in her</p>\n<p>arms, and her chin rested upon the top of it to keep it steady.</p>\n<p>Something in the look of her straight-gazing eyes made Ermengarde lose</p>\n",
        "<p>her wits still more.</p>\n<p>She felt as if Sara had changed into a new kind</p>\n<p>of girl, and she had never known her before.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was because she</p>\n<p>had suddenly grown poor and had to mend things and work like Becky.</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" she stammered.</p>\n<p>\"How--how are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know,\" Sara replied.</p>\n<p>\"How are you?\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I'm--I'm quite well,\" said Ermengarde, overwhelmed with shyness.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>spasmodically she thought of something to say which seemed more</p>\n<p>intimate.</p>\n<p>\"Are you--are you very unhappy?\" she said in a rush.</p>\n<p>Then Sara was guilty of an injustice.</p>\n<p>Just at that moment her torn</p>\n<p>heart swelled within her, and she felt that if anyone was as stupid as</p>\n<p>that, one had better get away from her.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"What do you think?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Do you think I am very happy?\" And she</p>\n<p>marched past her without another word.</p>\n<p>In course of time she realized that if her wretchedness had not made</p>\n<p>her forget things, she would have known that poor, dull Ermengarde was</p>\n<p>not to be blamed for her unready, awkward ways.</p>\n<p>She was always</p>\n<p>awkward, and the more she felt, the more stupid she was given to being.</p>\n<p>But the sudden thought which had flashed upon her had made her</p>\n",
        "<p>over-sensitive.</p>\n<p>\"She is like the others,\" she had thought.</p>\n<p>\"She does not really want</p>\n<p>to talk to me.</p>\n<p>She knows no one does.\"</p>\n<p>So for several weeks a barrier stood between them.</p>\n<p>When they met by</p>\n<p>chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too stiff and</p>\n<p>embarrassed to speak.</p>\n",
        "<p>Sometimes they nodded to each other in passing,</p>\n<p>but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting.</p>\n<p>\"If she would rather not talk to me,\" Sara thought, \"I will keep out of</p>\n<p>her way.</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin makes that easy enough.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each other</p>\n<p>at all.</p>\n<p>At that time it was noticed that Ermengarde was more stupid</p>\n<p>than ever, and that she looked listless and unhappy.</p>\n",
        "<p>She used to sit</p>\n<p>in the window-seat, huddled in a heap, and stare out of the window</p>\n<p>without speaking.</p>\n<p>Once Jessie, who was passing, stopped to look at her</p>\n<p>curiously.</p>\n<p>\"What are you crying for, Ermengarde?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not crying,\" answered Ermengarde, in a muffled, unsteady voice.</p>\n<p>\"You are,\" said Jessie.</p>\n<p>\"A great big tear just rolled down the bridge</p>\n",
        "<p>of your nose and dropped off at the end of it.</p>\n<p>And there goes another.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said Ermengarde, \"I'm miserable--and no one need interfere.\"</p>\n<p>And she turned her plump back and took out her handkerchief and boldly</p>\n<p>hid her face in it.</p>\n<p>That night, when Sara went to her attic, she was later than usual.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went to</p>\n<p>bed, and after that she had gone to her lessons in the lonely</p>\n",
        "<p>schoolroom.</p>\n<p>When she reached the top of the stairs, she was surprised</p>\n<p>to see a glimmer of light coming from under the attic door.</p>\n<p>\"Nobody goes there but myself,\" she thought quickly, \"but someone has</p>\n<p>lighted a candle.\"</p>\n<p>Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and it was not burning in the</p>\n<p>kitchen candlestick she was expected to use, but in one of those</p>\n<p>belonging to the pupils' bedrooms.</p>\n<p>The someone was sitting upon the</p>\n",
        "<p>battered footstool, and was dressed in her nightgown and wrapped up in</p>\n<p>a red shawl.</p>\n<p>It was Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"Ermengarde!\" cried Sara.</p>\n<p>She was so startled that she was almost</p>\n<p>frightened.</p>\n<p>\"You will get into trouble.\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde stumbled up from her footstool.</p>\n<p>She shuffled across the</p>\n",
        "<p>attic in her bedroom slippers, which were too large for her.</p>\n<p>Her eyes</p>\n<p>and nose were pink with crying.</p>\n<p>\"I know I shall--if I'm found out.\"  she said.</p>\n<p>\"But I don't care--I</p>\n<p>don't care a bit.</p>\n<p>Oh, Sara, please tell me.</p>\n<p>What is the matter?</p>\n<p>Why</p>\n",
        "<p>don't you like me any more?\"</p>\n<p>Something in her voice made the familiar lump rise in Sara's throat.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>was so affectionate and simple--so like the old Ermengarde who had</p>\n<p>asked her to be \"best friends.\"  It sounded as if she had not meant</p>\n<p>what she had seemed to mean during these past weeks.</p>\n<p>\"I do like you,\" Sara answered.</p>\n<p>\"I thought--you see, everything is</p>\n<p>different now.</p>\n",
        "<p>I thought you--were different.\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\"Why, it was you who were different!\" she cried.</p>\n<p>\"You didn't want to</p>\n<p>talk to me.</p>\n<p>I didn't know what to do.</p>\n<p>It was you who were different</p>\n<p>after I came back.\"</p>\n<p>Sara thought a moment.</p>\n",
        "<p>She saw she had made a mistake.</p>\n<p>\"I AM different,\" she explained, \"though not in the way you think.</p>\n<p>Miss</p>\n<p>Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls.</p>\n<p>Most of them don't want</p>\n<p>to talk to me.</p>\n<p>I thought--perhaps--you didn't.</p>\n<p>So I tried to keep out</p>\n<p>of your way.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Oh, Sara,\" Ermengarde almost wailed in her reproachful dismay.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>then after one more look they rushed into each other's arms.</p>\n<p>It must</p>\n<p>be confessed that Sara's small black head lay for some minutes on the</p>\n<p>shoulder covered by the red shawl.</p>\n<p>When Ermengarde had seemed to</p>\n<p>desert her, she had felt horribly lonely.</p>\n<p>Afterward they sat down upon the floor together, Sara clasping her</p>\n",
        "<p>knees with her arms, and Ermengarde rolled up in her shawl.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde</p>\n<p>looked at the odd, big-eyed little face adoringly.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't bear it any more,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"I dare say you could live</p>\n<p>without me, Sara; but I couldn't live without you.</p>\n<p>I was nearly DEAD.</p>\n<p>So tonight, when I was crying under the bedclothes, I thought all at</p>\n<p>once of creeping up here and just begging you to let us be friends</p>\n",

        "<p>\"I don't see any good in them,\" said Ermengarde stoutly.</p>\n<p>\"Neither do I--to speak the truth,\" admitted Sara, frankly.</p>\n<p>\"But I</p>\n<p>suppose there MIGHT be good in things, even if we don't see it.</p>\n<p>There</p>\n<p>MIGHT\"--doubtfully--\"be good in Miss Minchin.\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde looked round the attic with a rather fearsome curiosity.</p>\n<p>\"Sara,\" she said, \"do you think you can bear living here?\"</p>\n<p>Sara looked round also.</p>\n",

        "<p>No one but Sara could have done it.</p>\n<p>A well-known glow came into Sara's eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" she said, hugging her knees, \"that will be a good place to</p>\n<p>pretend about.</p>\n<p>I am a prisoner in the Bastille.</p>\n<p>I have been here for</p>\n<p>years and years--and years; and everybody has forgotten about me.</p>\n<p>Miss</p>\n<p>Minchin is the jailer--and Becky\"--a sudden light adding itself to the</p>\n",
        "<p>glow in her eyes--\"Becky is the prisoner in the next cell.\"</p>\n<p>She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I shall pretend that,\" she said; \"and it will be a great comfort.\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde was at once enraptured and awed.</p>\n<p>\"And will you tell me all about it?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"May I creep up here at</p>\n<p>night, whenever it is safe, and hear the things you have made up in the</p>\n<p>day?</p>\n<p>It will seem as if we were more 'best friends' than ever.\"</p>\n",

        "<p>She looked as if she was going to cry.</p>\n<p>And Sara hurriedly consoled her.</p>\n<p>\"Beggars have nowhere to live,\" she said courageously.</p>\n<p>\"I have a place</p>\n<p>to live in.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where do you live?\" persisted Lottie.</p>\n<p>\"The new girl sleeps in your</p>\n<p>room, and it isn't pretty any more.\"</p>\n<p>\"I live in another room,\" said Sara.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Is it a nice one?\" inquired Lottie.</p>\n<p>\"I want to go and see it.\"</p>\n<p>\"You must not talk,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Miss Minchin is looking at us.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>will be angry with me for letting you whisper.\"</p>\n<p>She had found out already that she was to be held accountable for</p>\n<p>everything which was objected to.</p>\n<p>If the children were not attentive,</p>\n",
        "<p>if they talked, if they were restless, it was she who would be reproved.</p>\n<p>But Lottie was a determined little person.</p>\n<p>If Sara would not tell her</p>\n<p>where she lived, she would find out in some other way.</p>\n<p>She talked to</p>\n<p>her small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened when</p>\n<p>they were gossiping; and acting upon certain information they had</p>\n<p>unconsciously let drop, she started late one afternoon on a voyage of</p>\n<p>discovery, climbing stairs she had never known the existence of, until</p>\n",
        "<p>she reached the attic floor.</p>\n<p>There she found two doors near each other,</p>\n<p>and opening one, she saw her beloved Sara standing upon an old table</p>\n<p>and looking out of a window.</p>\n<p>\"Sara!\" she cried, aghast.</p>\n<p>\"Mamma Sara!\"  She was aghast because the</p>\n<p>attic was so bare and ugly and seemed so far away from all the world.</p>\n<p>Her short legs had seemed to have been mounting hundreds of stairs.</p>\n<p>Sara turned round at the sound of her voice.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was her turn to be</p>\n<p>aghast.</p>\n<p>What would happen now?</p>\n<p>If Lottie began to cry and any one</p>\n<p>chanced to hear, they were both lost.</p>\n<p>She jumped down from her table</p>\n<p>and ran to the child.</p>\n<p>\"Don't cry and make a noise,\" she implored.</p>\n<p>\"I shall be scolded if you</p>\n",
        "<p>do, and I have been scolded all day.</p>\n<p>It's--it's not such a bad room,</p>\n<p>Lottie.\"</p>\n<p>\"Isn't it?\" gasped Lottie, and as she looked round it she bit her lip.</p>\n<p>She was a spoiled child yet, but she was fond enough of her adopted</p>\n<p>parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake.</p>\n<p>Then,</p>\n<p>somehow, it was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might</p>\n<p>turn out to be nice.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Why isn't it, Sara?\" she almost whispered.</p>\n<p>Sara hugged her close and tried to laugh.</p>\n<p>There was a sort of comfort</p>\n<p>in the warmth of the plump, childish body.</p>\n<p>She had had a hard day and</p>\n<p>had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes.</p>\n<p>\"You can see all sorts of things you can't see downstairs,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"What sort of things?\" demanded Lottie, with that curiosity Sara could</p>\n<p>always awaken even in bigger girls.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Chimneys--quite close to us--with smoke curling up in wreaths and</p>\n<p>clouds and going up into the sky--and sparrows hopping about and</p>\n<p>talking to each other just as if they were people--and other attic</p>\n<p>windows where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they</p>\n<p>belong to.</p>\n<p>And it all feels as high up--as if it was another world.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, let me see it!\" cried Lottie.</p>\n<p>\"Lift me up!\"</p>\n<p>Sara lifted her up, and they stood on the old table together and leaned</p>\n",
        "<p>on the edge of the flat window in the roof, and looked out.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has not done this does not know what a different world they</p>\n<p>saw.</p>\n<p>The slates spread out on either side of them and slanted down</p>\n<p>into the rain gutter-pipes.</p>\n<p>The sparrows, being at home there,</p>\n<p>twittered and hopped about quite without fear.</p>\n<p>Two of them perched on</p>\n<p>the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until</p>\n",
        "<p>one pecked the other and drove him away.</p>\n<p>The garret window next to</p>\n<p>theirs was shut because the house next door was empty.</p>\n<p>\"I wish someone lived there,\" Sara said.</p>\n<p>\"It is so close that if there</p>\n<p>was a little girl in the attic, we could talk to each other through the</p>\n<p>windows and climb over to see each other, if we were not afraid of</p>\n<p>falling.\"</p>\n<p>The sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the street,</p>\n",
        "<p>that Lottie was enchanted.</p>\n<p>From the attic window, among the chimney</p>\n<p>pots, the things which were happening in the world below seemed almost</p>\n<p>unreal.</p>\n<p>One scarcely believed in the existence of Miss Minchin and</p>\n<p>Miss Amelia and the schoolroom, and the roll of wheels in the square</p>\n<p>seemed a sound belonging to another existence.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Sara!\" cried Lottie, cuddling in her guarding arm.</p>\n<p>\"I like this</p>\n",
        "<p>attic--I like it!</p>\n<p>It is nicer than downstairs!\"</p>\n<p>\"Look at that sparrow,\" whispered Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I wish I had some crumbs to</p>\n<p>throw to him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have some!\" came in a little shriek from Lottie.</p>\n<p>\"I have part of a</p>\n<p>bun in my pocket; I bought it with my penny yesterday, and I saved a</p>\n<p>bit.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>When they threw out a few crumbs the sparrow jumped and flew away to an</p>\n<p>adjacent chimney top.</p>\n<p>He was evidently not accustomed to intimates in</p>\n<p>attics, and unexpected crumbs startled him.</p>\n<p>But when Lottie remained</p>\n<p>quite still and Sara chirped very softly--almost as if she were a</p>\n<p>sparrow herself--he saw that the thing which had alarmed him</p>\n<p>represented hospitality, after all.</p>\n<p>He put his head on one side, and</p>\n",
        "<p>from his perch on the chimney looked down at the crumbs with twinkling</p>\n<p>eyes.</p>\n<p>Lottie could scarcely keep still.</p>\n<p>\"Will he come?</p>\n<p>Will he come?\" she whispered.</p>\n<p>\"His eyes look as if he would,\" Sara whispered back.</p>\n<p>\"He is thinking</p>\n<p>and thinking whether he dare.</p>\n<p>Yes, he will!</p>\n",
        "<p>Yes, he is coming!\"</p>\n<p>He flew down and hopped toward the crumbs, but stopped a few inches</p>\n<p>away from them, putting his head on one side again, as if reflecting on</p>\n<p>the chances that Sara and Lottie might turn out to be big cats and jump</p>\n<p>on him.</p>\n<p>At last his heart told him they were really nicer than they</p>\n<p>looked, and he hopped nearer and nearer, darted at the biggest crumb</p>\n<p>with a lightning peck, seized it, and carried it away to the other side</p>\n<p>of his chimney.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Now he KNOWS\", said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"And he will come back for the others.\"</p>\n<p>He did come back, and even brought a friend, and the friend went away</p>\n<p>and brought a relative, and among them they made a hearty meal over</p>\n<p>which they twittered and chattered and exclaimed, stopping every now</p>\n<p>and then to put their heads on one side and examine Lottie and Sara.</p>\n<p>Lottie was so delighted that she quite forgot her first shocked</p>\n<p>impression of the attic.</p>\n<p>In fact, when she was lifted down from the</p>\n",
        "<p>table and returned to earthly things, as it were, Sara was able to</p>\n<p>point out to her many beauties in the room which she herself would not</p>\n<p>have suspected the existence of.</p>\n<p>\"It is so little and so high above everything,\" she said, \"that it is</p>\n<p>almost like a nest in a tree.</p>\n<p>The slanting ceiling is so funny.</p>\n<p>See,</p>\n<p>you can scarcely stand up at this end of the room; and when the morning</p>\n<p>begins to come I can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through</p>\n",
        "<p>that flat window in the roof.</p>\n<p>It is like a square patch of light.</p>\n<p>If</p>\n<p>the sun is going to shine, little pink clouds float about, and I feel</p>\n<p>as if I could touch them.</p>\n<p>And if it rains, the drops patter and patter</p>\n<p>as if they were saying something nice.</p>\n<p>Then if there are stars, you</p>\n<p>can lie and try to count how many go into the patch.</p>\n",
        "<p>It takes such a</p>\n<p>lot.</p>\n<p>And just look at that tiny, rusty grate in the corner.</p>\n<p>If it was</p>\n<p>polished and there was a fire in it, just think how nice it would be.</p>\n<p>You see, it's really a beautiful little room.\"</p>\n<p>She was walking round the small place, holding Lottie's hand and making</p>\n<p>gestures which described all the beauties she was making herself see.</p>\n<p>She quite made Lottie see them, too.</p>\n",
        "<p>Lottie could always believe in</p>\n<p>the things Sara made pictures of.</p>\n<p>\"You see,\" she said, \"there could be a thick, soft blue Indian rug on</p>\n<p>the floor; and in that corner there could be a soft little sofa, with</p>\n<p>cushions to curl up on; and just over it could be a shelf full of books</p>\n<p>so that one could reach them easily; and there could be a fur rug</p>\n<p>before the fire, and hangings on the wall to cover up the whitewash,</p>\n<p>and pictures.</p>\n<p>They would have to be little ones, but they could be</p>\n",
        "<p>beautiful; and there could be a lamp with a deep rose-colored shade;</p>\n<p>and a table in the middle, with things to have tea with; and a little</p>\n<p>fat copper kettle singing on the hob; and the bed could be quite</p>\n<p>different.</p>\n<p>It could be made soft and covered with a lovely silk</p>\n<p>coverlet.</p>\n<p>It could be beautiful.</p>\n<p>And perhaps we could coax the</p>\n<p>sparrows until we made such friends with them that they would come and</p>\n",
        "<p>peck at the window and ask to be let in.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Sara!\" cried Lottie.</p>\n<p>\"I should like to live here!\"</p>\n<p>When Sara had persuaded her to go downstairs again, and, after setting</p>\n<p>her on her way, had come back to her attic, she stood in the middle of</p>\n<p>it and looked about her.</p>\n<p>The enchantment of her imaginings for Lottie</p>\n<p>had died away.</p>\n<p>The bed was hard and covered with its dingy quilt.</p>\n",
        "<p>The</p>\n<p>whitewashed wall showed its broken patches, the floor was cold and</p>\n<p>bare, the grate was broken and rusty, and the battered footstool,</p>\n<p>tilted sideways on its injured leg, the only seat in the room.</p>\n<p>She sat</p>\n<p>down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>mere fact that Lottie had come and gone away again made things seem a</p>\n<p>little worse--just as perhaps prisoners feel a little more desolate</p>\n",
        "<p>after visitors come and go, leaving them behind.</p>\n<p>\"It's a lonely place,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes it's the loneliest place</p>\n<p>in the world.\"</p>\n<p>She was sitting in this way when her attention was attracted by a</p>\n<p>slight sound near her.</p>\n<p>She lifted her head to see where it came from,</p>\n<p>and if she had been a nervous child she would have left her seat on the</p>\n<p>battered footstool in a great hurry.</p>\n",
        "<p>A large rat was sitting up on his</p>\n<p>hind quarters and sniffing the air in an interested manner.</p>\n<p>Some of</p>\n<p>Lottie's crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their scent had drawn</p>\n<p>him out of his hole.</p>\n<p>He looked so queer and so like a gray-whiskered dwarf or gnome that</p>\n<p>Sara was rather fascinated.</p>\n<p>He looked at her with his bright eyes, as</p>\n<p>if he were asking a question.</p>\n",
        "<p>He was evidently so doubtful that one of</p>\n<p>the child's queer thoughts came into her mind.</p>\n<p>\"I dare say it is rather hard to be a rat,\" she mused.</p>\n<p>\"Nobody likes</p>\n<p>you.</p>\n<p>People jump and run away and scream out, 'Oh, a horrid rat!'  I</p>\n<p>shouldn't like people to scream and jump and say, 'Oh, a horrid Sara!'</p>\n<p>the moment they saw me.</p>\n<p>And set traps for me, and pretend they were</p>\n",
        "<p>dinner.</p>\n<p>It's so different to be a sparrow.</p>\n<p>But nobody asked this rat</p>\n<p>if he wanted to be a rat when he was made.</p>\n<p>Nobody said, 'Wouldn't you</p>\n<p>rather be a sparrow?'\"</p>\n<p>She had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage.</p>\n<p>He was</p>\n<p>very much afraid of her, but perhaps he had a heart like the sparrow</p>\n",
        "<p>and it told him that she was not a thing which pounced.</p>\n<p>He was very</p>\n<p>hungry.</p>\n<p>He had a wife and a large family in the wall, and they had had</p>\n<p>frightfully bad luck for several days.</p>\n<p>He had left the children crying</p>\n<p>bitterly, and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs, so he</p>\n<p>cautiously dropped upon his feet.</p>\n<p>\"Come on,\" said Sara; \"I'm not a trap.</p>\n",
        "<p>You can have them, poor thing!</p>\n<p>Prisoners in the Bastille used to make friends with rats.</p>\n<p>Suppose I</p>\n<p>make friends with you.\"</p>\n<p>How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is</p>\n<p>certain that they do understand.</p>\n<p>Perhaps there is a language which is</p>\n<p>not made of words and everything in the world understands it.</p>\n<p>Perhaps</p>\n",
        "<p>there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without</p>\n<p>even making a sound, to another soul.</p>\n<p>But whatsoever was the reason,</p>\n<p>the rat knew from that moment that he was safe--even though he was a</p>\n<p>rat.</p>\n<p>He knew that this young human being sitting on the red footstool</p>\n<p>would not jump up and terrify him with wild, sharp noises or throw</p>\n<p>heavy objects at him which, if they did not fall and crush him, would</p>\n<p>send him limping in his scurry back to his hole.</p>\n",
        "<p>He was really a very</p>\n<p>nice rat, and did not mean the least harm.</p>\n<p>When he had stood on his</p>\n<p>hind legs and sniffed the air, with his bright eyes fixed on Sara, he</p>\n<p>had hoped that she would understand this, and would not begin by hating</p>\n<p>him as an enemy.</p>\n<p>When the mysterious thing which speaks without saying</p>\n<p>any words told him that she would not, he went softly toward the crumbs</p>\n<p>and began to eat them.</p>\n",
        "<p>As he did it he glanced every now and then at</p>\n<p>Sara, just as the sparrows had done, and his expression was so very</p>\n<p>apologetic that it touched her heart.</p>\n<p>She sat and watched him without making any movement.</p>\n<p>One crumb was</p>\n<p>very much larger than the others--in fact, it could scarcely be called</p>\n<p>a crumb.</p>\n<p>It was evident that he wanted that piece very much, but it</p>\n<p>lay quite near the footstool and he was still rather timid.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I believe he wants it to carry to his family in the wall,\" Sara</p>\n<p>thought.</p>\n<p>\"If I do not stir at all, perhaps he will come and get it.\"</p>\n<p>She scarcely allowed herself to breathe, she was so deeply interested.</p>\n<p>The rat shuffled a little nearer and ate a few more crumbs, then he</p>\n<p>stopped and sniffed delicately, giving a side glance at the occupant of</p>\n<p>the footstool; then he darted at the piece of bun with something very</p>\n<p>like the sudden boldness of the sparrow, and the instant he had</p>\n<p>possession of it fled back to the wall, slipped down a crack in the</p>\n",
        "<p>skirting board, and was gone.</p>\n<p>\"I knew he wanted it for his children,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I do believe I</p>\n<p>could make friends with him.\"</p>\n<p>A week or so afterward, on one of the rare nights when Ermengarde found</p>\n<p>it safe to steal up to the attic, when she tapped on the door with the</p>\n<p>tips of her fingers Sara did not come to her for two or three minutes.</p>\n<p>There was, indeed, such a silence in the room at first that Ermengarde</p>\n<p>wondered if she could have fallen asleep.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then, to her surprise, she</p>\n<p>heard her utter a little, low laugh and speak coaxingly to someone.</p>\n<p>\"There!\"  Ermengarde heard her say.</p>\n<p>\"Take it and go home, Melchisedec!</p>\n<p>Go home to your wife!\"</p>\n<p>Almost immediately Sara opened the door, and when she did so she found</p>\n<p>Ermengarde standing with alarmed eyes upon the threshold.</p>\n<p>\"Who--who ARE you talking to, Sara?\" she gasped out.</p>\n<p>Sara drew her in cautiously, but she looked as if something pleased and</p>\n",
        "<p>amused her.</p>\n<p>\"You must promise not to be frightened--not to scream the least bit, or</p>\n<p>I can't tell you,\" she answered.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde felt almost inclined to scream on the spot, but managed to</p>\n<p>control herself.</p>\n<p>She looked all round the attic and saw no one.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>yet Sara had certainly been speaking TO someone.</p>\n<p>She thought of ghosts.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Is it--something that will frighten me?\" she asked timorously.</p>\n<p>\"Some people are afraid of them,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I was at first--but I am</p>\n<p>not now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Was it--a ghost?\" quaked Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Sara, laughing.</p>\n<p>\"It was my rat.\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde made one bound, and landed in the middle of the little dingy</p>\n<p>bed.</p>\n",
        "<p>She tucked her feet under her nightgown and the red shawl.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>did not scream, but she gasped with fright.</p>\n<p>\"Oh!</p>\n<p>Oh!\" she cried under her breath.</p>\n<p>\"A rat!</p>\n<p>A rat!\"</p>\n<p>\"I was afraid you would be frightened,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"But you needn't</p>\n",
        "<p>be.</p>\n<p>I am making him tame.</p>\n<p>He actually knows me and comes out when I</p>\n<p>call him.</p>\n<p>Are you too frightened to want to see him?\"</p>\n<p>The truth was that, as the days had gone on and, with the aid of scraps</p>\n<p>brought up from the kitchen, her curious friendship had developed, she</p>\n<p>had gradually forgotten that the timid creature she was becoming</p>\n<p>familiar with was a mere rat.</p>\n",
        "<p>At first Ermengarde was too much alarmed to do anything but huddle in a</p>\n<p>heap upon the bed and tuck up her feet, but the sight of Sara's</p>\n<p>composed little countenance and the story of Melchisedec's first</p>\n<p>appearance began at last to rouse her curiosity, and she leaned forward</p>\n<p>over the edge of the bed and watched Sara go and kneel down by the hole</p>\n<p>in the skirting board.</p>\n<p>\"He--he won't run out quickly and jump on the bed, will he?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" answered Sara.</p>\n<p>\"He's as polite as we are.</p>\n",
        "<p>He is just like a</p>\n<p>person.</p>\n<p>Now watch!\"</p>\n<p>She began to make a low, whistling sound--so low and coaxing that it</p>\n<p>could only have been heard in entire stillness.</p>\n<p>She did it several</p>\n<p>times, looking entirely absorbed in it.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde thought she looked</p>\n<p>as if she were working a spell.</p>\n",
        "<p>And at last, evidently in response to</p>\n<p>it, a gray-whiskered, bright-eyed head peeped out of the hole.</p>\n<p>Sara</p>\n<p>had some crumbs in her hand.</p>\n<p>She dropped them, and Melchisedec came</p>\n<p>quietly forth and ate them.</p>\n<p>A piece of larger size than the rest he</p>\n<p>took and carried in the most businesslike manner back to his home.</p>\n<p>\"You see,\" said Sara, \"that is for his wife and children.</p>\n",
        "<p>He is very</p>\n<p>nice.</p>\n<p>He only eats the little bits.</p>\n<p>After he goes back I can always</p>\n<p>hear his family squeaking for joy.</p>\n<p>There are three kinds of squeaks.</p>\n<p>One kind is the children's, and one is Mrs.</p>\n<p>Melchisedec's, and one is</p>\n<p>Melchisedec's own.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Ermengarde began to laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Sara!\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"You ARE queer--but you are nice.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know I am queer,\" admitted Sara, cheerfully; \"and I TRY to be nice.\"</p>\n<p>She rubbed her forehead with her little brown paw, and a puzzled,</p>\n<p>tender look came into her face.</p>\n<p>\"Papa always laughed at me,\" she said;</p>\n<p>\"but I liked it.</p>\n<p>He thought I was queer, but he liked me to make up</p>\n",
        "<p>things.</p>\n<p>I--I can't help making up things.</p>\n<p>If I didn't, I don't</p>\n<p>believe I could live.\"  She paused and glanced around the attic.</p>\n<p>\"I'm</p>\n<p>sure I couldn't live here,\" she added in a low voice.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde was interested, as she always was.</p>\n<p>\"When you talk about</p>\n<p>things,\" she said, \"they seem as if they grew real.</p>\n",
        "<p>You talk about</p>\n<p>Melchisedec as if he was a person.\"</p>\n<p>\"He IS a person,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"He gets hungry and frightened, just as</p>\n<p>we do; and he is married and has children.</p>\n<p>How do we know he doesn't</p>\n<p>think things, just as we do?</p>\n<p>His eyes look as if he was a person.</p>\n<p>That was why I gave him a name.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>She sat down on the floor in her favorite attitude, holding her knees.</p>\n<p>\"Besides,\" she said, \"he is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend.</p>\n<p>I can</p>\n<p>always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away, and it is quite</p>\n<p>enough to support him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is it the Bastille yet?\" asked Ermengarde, eagerly.</p>\n<p>\"Do you always</p>\n<p>pretend it is the Bastille?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nearly always,\" answered Sara.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Sometimes I try to pretend it is</p>\n<p>another kind of place; but the Bastille is generally</p>\n<p>easiest--particularly when it is cold.\"</p>\n<p>Just at that moment Ermengarde almost jumped off the bed, she was so</p>\n<p>startled by a sound she heard.</p>\n<p>It was like two distinct knocks on the</p>\n<p>wall.</p>\n<p>\"What is that?\" she exclaimed.</p>\n<p>Sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically:</p>\n",
        "<p>\"It is the prisoner in the next cell.\"</p>\n<p>\"Becky!\" cried Ermengarde, enraptured.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Listen; the two knocks meant, 'Prisoner, are you</p>\n<p>there?'\"</p>\n<p>She knocked three times on the wall herself, as if in answer.</p>\n<p>\"That means, 'Yes, I am here, and all is well.'\"</p>\n<p>Four knocks came from Becky's side of the wall.</p>\n<p>\"That means,\" explained Sara, \"'Then, fellow-sufferer, we will sleep in</p>\n",
        "<p>peace.</p>\n<p>Good night.'\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde quite beamed with delight.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Sara!\" she whispered joyfully.</p>\n<p>\"It is like a story!\"</p>\n<p>\"It IS a story,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"EVERYTHING'S a story.</p>\n<p>You are a story--I</p>\n<p>am a story.</p>\n",

        "<p>I will give it</p>\n<p>to you.\"</p>\n<p>Sara started, and all at once realized that she looked exactly like</p>\n<p>poor children she had seen, in her better days, waiting on the pavement</p>\n<p>to watch her as she got out of her brougham.</p>\n<p>And she had given them</p>\n<p>pennies many a time.</p>\n<p>Her face went red and then it went pale, and for</p>\n<p>a second she felt as if she could not take the dear little sixpence.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Oh, no!\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, no, thank you; I mustn't take it, indeed!\"</p>\n<p>Her voice was so unlike an ordinary street child's voice and her manner</p>\n<p>was so like the manner of a well-bred little person that Veronica</p>\n<p>Eustacia (whose real name was Janet) and Rosalind Gladys (who was</p>\n<p>really called Nora) leaned forward to listen.</p>\n<p>But Guy Clarence was not to be thwarted in his benevolence.</p>\n<p>He thrust</p>\n<p>the sixpence into her hand.</p>\n",

        "<p>a sort of heartbroken rage seized her.</p>\n<p>She lifted her little savage</p>\n<p>hand and knocked Emily off the chair, bursting into a passion of</p>\n<p>sobbing--Sara who never cried.</p>\n<p>\"You are nothing but a DOLL!\" she cried.</p>\n<p>\"Nothing but a</p>\n<p>doll--doll--doll!</p>\n<p>You care for nothing.</p>\n<p>You are stuffed with sawdust.</p>\n",

        "<p>Sara laughed a little.</p>\n<p>\"I don't believe he worships that idol,\" she said; \"some people like to</p>\n<p>keep them to look at because they are interesting.</p>\n<p>My papa had a</p>\n<p>beautiful one, and he did not worship it.\"</p>\n<p>But Becky was rather inclined to prefer to believe that the new</p>\n<p>neighbor was \"an 'eathen.\"  It sounded so much more romantic than that</p>\n<p>he should merely be the ordinary kind of gentleman who went to church</p>\n<p>with a prayer book.</p>\n",
        "<p>She sat and talked long that night of what he</p>\n<p>would be like, of what his wife would be like if he had one, and of</p>\n<p>what his children would be like if they had children.</p>\n<p>Sara saw that</p>\n<p>privately she could not help hoping very much that they would all be</p>\n<p>black, and would wear turbans, and, above all, that--like their</p>\n<p>parent--they would all be \"'eathens.\"</p>\n<p>\"I never lived next door to no 'eathens, miss,\" she said; \"I should</p>\n<p>like to see what sort o' ways they'd have.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>It was several weeks before her curiosity was satisfied, and then it</p>\n<p>was revealed that the new occupant had neither wife nor children.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>was a solitary man with no family at all, and it was evident that he</p>\n<p>was shattered in health and unhappy in mind.</p>\n<p>A carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house.</p>\n<p>When the</p>\n<p>footman dismounted from the box and opened the door the gentleman who</p>\n<p>was the father of the Large Family got out first.</p>\n",
        "<p>After him there</p>\n<p>descended a nurse in uniform, then came down the steps two</p>\n<p>men-servants.</p>\n<p>They came to assist their master, who, when he was helped</p>\n<p>out of the carriage, proved to be a man with a haggard, distressed</p>\n<p>face, and a skeleton body wrapped in furs.</p>\n<p>He was carried up the</p>\n<p>steps, and the head of the Large Family went with him, looking very</p>\n<p>anxious.</p>\n",
        "<p>Shortly afterward a doctor's carriage arrived, and the doctor</p>\n<p>went in--plainly to take care of him.</p>\n<p>\"There is such a yellow gentleman next door, Sara,\" Lottie whispered at</p>\n<p>the French class afterward.</p>\n<p>\"Do you think he is a Chinee?</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>geography says the Chinee men are yellow.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, he is not Chinese,\" Sara whispered back; \"he is very ill.</p>\n<p>Go on</p>\n",
        "<p>with your exercise, Lottie.</p>\n<p>'Non, monsieur.</p>\n<p>Je n'ai pas le canif de</p>\n<p>mon oncle.'\"</p>\n<p>That was the beginning of the story of the Indian gentleman.</p>\n<p>11</p>\n<p>Ram Dass</p>\n<p>There were fine sunsets even in the square, sometimes.</p>\n<p>One could only</p>\n",
        "<p>see parts of them, however, between the chimneys and over the roofs.</p>\n<p>From the kitchen windows one could not see them at all, and could only</p>\n<p>guess that they were going on because the bricks looked warm and the</p>\n<p>air rosy or yellow for a while, or perhaps one saw a blazing glow</p>\n<p>strike a particular pane of glass somewhere.</p>\n<p>There was, however, one</p>\n<p>place from which one could see all the splendor of them: the piles of</p>\n<p>red or gold clouds in the west; or the purple ones edged with dazzling</p>\n<p>brightness; or the little fleecy, floating ones, tinged with rose-color</p>\n",
        "<p>and looking like flights of pink doves scurrying across the blue in a</p>\n<p>great hurry if there was a wind.</p>\n<p>The place where one could see all</p>\n<p>this, and seem at the same time to breathe a purer air, was, of course,</p>\n<p>the attic window.</p>\n<p>When the square suddenly seemed to begin to glow in</p>\n<p>an enchanted way and look wonderful in spite of its sooty trees and</p>\n<p>railings, Sara knew something was going on in the sky; and when it was</p>\n<p>at all possible to leave the kitchen without being missed or called</p>\n",
        "<p>back, she invariably stole away and crept up the flights of stairs,</p>\n<p>and, climbing on the old table, got her head and body as far out of the</p>\n<p>window as possible.</p>\n<p>When she had accomplished this, she always drew a</p>\n<p>long breath and looked all round her.</p>\n<p>It used to seem as if she had</p>\n<p>all the sky and the world to herself.</p>\n<p>No one else ever looked out of</p>\n<p>the other attics.</p>\n",
        "<p>Generally the skylights were closed; but even if</p>\n<p>they were propped open to admit air, no one seemed to come near them.</p>\n<p>And there Sara would stand, sometimes turning her face upward to the</p>\n<p>blue which seemed so friendly and near--just like a lovely vaulted</p>\n<p>ceiling--sometimes watching the west and all the wonderful things that</p>\n<p>happened there: the clouds melting or drifting or waiting softly to be</p>\n<p>changed pink or crimson or snow-white or purple or pale dove-gray.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they made islands or great mountains enclosing lakes of deep</p>\n<p>turquoise-blue, or liquid amber, or chrysoprase-green; sometimes dark</p>\n",
        "<p>headlands jutted into strange, lost seas; sometimes slender strips of</p>\n<p>wonderful lands joined other wonderful lands together.</p>\n<p>There were</p>\n<p>places where it seemed that one could run or climb or stand and wait to</p>\n<p>see what next was coming--until, perhaps, as it all melted, one could</p>\n<p>float away.</p>\n<p>At least it seemed so to Sara, and nothing had ever been</p>\n<p>quite so beautiful to her as the things she saw as she stood on the</p>\n<p>table--her body half out of the skylight--the sparrows twittering with</p>\n",
        "<p>sunset softness on the slates.</p>\n<p>The sparrows always seemed to her to</p>\n<p>twitter with a sort of subdued softness just when these marvels were</p>\n<p>going on.</p>\n<p>There was such a sunset as this a few days after the Indian gentleman</p>\n<p>was brought to his new home; and, as it fortunately happened that the</p>\n<p>afternoon's work was done in the kitchen and nobody had ordered her to</p>\n<p>go anywhere or perform any task, Sara found it easier than usual to</p>\n<p>slip away and go upstairs.</p>\n",
        "<p>She mounted her table and stood looking out.</p>\n<p>It was a wonderful</p>\n<p>moment.</p>\n<p>There were floods of molten gold covering the west, as if a</p>\n<p>glorious tide was sweeping over the world.</p>\n<p>A deep, rich yellow light</p>\n<p>filled the air; the birds flying across the tops of the houses showed</p>\n<p>quite black against it.</p>\n<p>\"It's a Splendid one,\" said Sara, softly, to herself.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"It makes me</p>\n<p>feel almost afraid--as if something strange was just going to happen.</p>\n<p>The Splendid ones always make me feel like that.\"</p>\n<p>She suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few yards away</p>\n<p>from her.</p>\n<p>It was an odd sound like a queer little squeaky chattering.</p>\n<p>It came from the window of the next attic.</p>\n<p>Someone had come to look at</p>\n<p>the sunset as she had.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was a head and a part of a body emerging</p>\n<p>from the skylight, but it was not the head or body of a little girl or</p>\n<p>a housemaid; it was the picturesque white-swathed form and dark-faced,</p>\n<p>gleaming-eyed, white-turbaned head of a native Indian man-servant--\"a</p>\n<p>Lascar,\" Sara said to herself quickly--and the sound she had heard came</p>\n<p>from a small monkey he held in his arms as if he were fond of it, and</p>\n<p>which was snuggling and chattering against his breast.</p>\n<p>As Sara looked toward him he looked toward her.</p>\n<p>The first thing she</p>\n",
        "<p>thought was that his dark face looked sorrowful and homesick.</p>\n<p>She felt</p>\n<p>absolutely sure he had come up to look at the sun, because he had seen</p>\n<p>it so seldom in England that he longed for a sight of it.</p>\n<p>She looked at</p>\n<p>him interestedly for a second, and then smiled across the slates.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>had learned to know how comforting a smile, even from a stranger, may</p>\n<p>be.</p>\n",
        "<p>Hers was evidently a pleasure to him.</p>\n<p>His whole expression altered,</p>\n<p>and he showed such gleaming white teeth as he smiled back that it was</p>\n<p>as if a light had been illuminated in his dusky face.</p>\n<p>The friendly look</p>\n<p>in Sara's eyes was always very effective when people felt tired or dull.</p>\n<p>It was perhaps in making his salute to her that he loosened his hold on</p>\n<p>the monkey.</p>\n<p>He was an impish monkey and always ready for adventure,</p>\n",
        "<p>and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>suddenly broke loose, jumped on to the slates, ran across them</p>\n<p>chattering, and actually leaped on to Sara's shoulder, and from there</p>\n<p>down into her attic room.</p>\n<p>It made her laugh and delighted her; but she</p>\n<p>knew he must be restored to his master--if the Lascar was his</p>\n<p>master--and she wondered how this was to be done.</p>\n<p>Would he let her</p>\n",
        "<p>catch him, or would he be naughty and refuse to be caught, and perhaps</p>\n<p>get away and run off over the roofs and be lost?</p>\n<p>That would not do at</p>\n<p>all.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he belonged to the Indian gentleman, and the poor man was</p>\n<p>fond of him.</p>\n<p>She turned to the Lascar, feeling glad that she remembered still some</p>\n<p>of the Hindustani she had learned when she lived with her father.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",
        "<p>could make the man understand.</p>\n<p>She spoke to him in the language he</p>\n<p>knew.</p>\n<p>\"Will he let me catch him?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>She thought she had never seen more surprise and delight than the dark</p>\n<p>face expressed when she spoke in the familiar tongue.</p>\n<p>The truth was</p>\n<p>that the poor fellow felt as if his gods had intervened, and the kind</p>\n<p>little voice came from heaven itself.</p>\n",
        "<p>At once Sara saw that he had</p>\n<p>been accustomed to European children.</p>\n<p>He poured forth a flood of</p>\n<p>respectful thanks.</p>\n<p>He was the servant of Missee Sahib.</p>\n<p>The monkey was</p>\n<p>a good monkey and would not bite; but, unfortunately, he was difficult</p>\n<p>to catch.</p>\n<p>He would flee from one spot to another, like the lightning.</p>\n",
        "<p>He was disobedient, though not evil.</p>\n<p>Ram Dass knew him as if he were</p>\n<p>his child, and Ram Dass he would sometimes obey, but not always.</p>\n<p>If</p>\n<p>Missee Sahib would permit Ram Dass, he himself could cross the roof to</p>\n<p>her room, enter the windows, and regain the unworthy little animal.</p>\n<p>But he was evidently afraid Sara might think he was taking a great</p>\n<p>liberty and perhaps would not let him come.</p>\n<p>But Sara gave him leave at once.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Can you get across?\" she inquired.</p>\n<p>\"In a moment,\" he answered her.</p>\n<p>\"Then come,\" she said; \"he is flying from side to side of the room as</p>\n<p>if he was frightened.\"</p>\n<p>Ram Dass slipped through his attic window and crossed to hers as</p>\n<p>steadily and lightly as if he had walked on roofs all his life.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>slipped through the skylight and dropped upon his feet without a sound.</p>\n<p>Then he turned to Sara and salaamed again.</p>\n",
        "<p>The monkey saw him and</p>\n<p>uttered a little scream.</p>\n<p>Ram Dass hastily took the precaution of</p>\n<p>shutting the skylight, and then went in chase of him.</p>\n<p>It was not a very</p>\n<p>long chase.</p>\n<p>The monkey prolonged it a few minutes evidently for the</p>\n<p>mere fun of it, but presently he sprang chattering on to Ram Dass's</p>\n<p>shoulder and sat there chattering and clinging to his neck with a weird</p>\n",
        "<p>little skinny arm.</p>\n<p>Ram Dass thanked Sara profoundly.</p>\n<p>She had seen that his quick native</p>\n<p>eyes had taken in at a glance all the bare shabbiness of the room, but</p>\n<p>he spoke to her as if he were speaking to the little daughter of a</p>\n<p>rajah, and pretended that he observed nothing.</p>\n<p>He did not presume to</p>\n<p>remain more than a few moments after he had caught the monkey, and</p>\n<p>those moments were given to further deep and grateful obeisance to her</p>\n",
        "<p>in return for her indulgence.</p>\n<p>This little evil one, he said, stroking</p>\n<p>the monkey, was, in truth, not so evil as he seemed, and his master,</p>\n<p>who was ill, was sometimes amused by him.</p>\n<p>He would have been made sad</p>\n<p>if his favorite had run away and been lost.</p>\n<p>Then he salaamed once more</p>\n<p>and got through the skylight and across the slates again with as much</p>\n<p>agility as the monkey himself had displayed.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he had gone Sara stood in the middle of her attic and thought of</p>\n<p>many things his face and his manner had brought back to her.</p>\n<p>The sight</p>\n<p>of his native costume and the profound reverence of his manner stirred</p>\n<p>all her past memories.</p>\n<p>It seemed a strange thing to remember that</p>\n<p>she--the drudge whom the cook had said insulting things to an hour</p>\n<p>ago--had only a few years ago been surrounded by people who all treated</p>\n<p>her as Ram Dass had treated her; who salaamed when she went by, whose</p>\n",
        "<p>foreheads almost touched the ground when she spoke to them, who were</p>\n<p>her servants and her slaves.</p>\n<p>It was like a sort of dream.</p>\n<p>It was all</p>\n<p>over, and it could never come back.</p>\n<p>It certainly seemed that there was</p>\n<p>no way in which any change could take place.</p>\n<p>She knew what Miss Minchin</p>\n<p>intended that her future should be.</p>\n",
        "<p>So long as she was too young to be</p>\n<p>used as a regular teacher, she would be used as an errand girl and</p>\n<p>servant and yet expected to remember what she had learned and in some</p>\n<p>mysterious way to learn more.</p>\n<p>The greater number of her evenings she</p>\n<p>was supposed to spend at study, and at various indefinite intervals she</p>\n<p>was examined and knew she would have been severely admonished if she</p>\n<p>had not advanced as was expected of her.</p>\n<p>The truth, indeed, was that</p>\n",
        "<p>Miss Minchin knew that she was too anxious to learn to require</p>\n<p>teachers.</p>\n<p>Give her books, and she would devour them and end by knowing</p>\n<p>them by heart.</p>\n<p>She might be trusted to be equal to teaching a good</p>\n<p>deal in the course of a few years.</p>\n<p>This was what would happen: when</p>\n<p>she was older she would be expected to drudge in the schoolroom as she</p>\n<p>drudged now in various parts of the house; they would be obliged to</p>\n",
        "<p>give her more respectable clothes, but they would be sure to be plain</p>\n<p>and ugly and to make her look somehow like a servant.</p>\n<p>That was all</p>\n<p>there seemed to be to look forward to, and Sara stood quite still for</p>\n<p>several minutes and thought it over.</p>\n<p>Then a thought came back to her which made the color rise in her cheek</p>\n<p>and a spark light itself in her eyes.</p>\n<p>She straightened her thin little</p>\n<p>body and lifted her head.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Whatever comes,\" she said, \"cannot alter one thing.</p>\n<p>If I am a</p>\n<p>princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside.</p>\n<p>It would be</p>\n<p>easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a</p>\n<p>great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>There was Marie Antoinette when she was in prison and her throne</p>\n<p>was gone and she had only a black gown on, and her hair was white, and</p>\n",
        "<p>they insulted her and called her Widow Capet.</p>\n<p>She was a great deal more</p>\n<p>like a queen then than when she was so gay and everything was so grand.</p>\n<p>I like her best then.</p>\n<p>Those howling mobs of people did not frighten</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>She was stronger than they were, even when they cut her head off.\"</p>\n<p>This was not a new thought, but quite an old one, by this time.</p>\n<p>It had</p>\n",
        "<p>consoled her through many a bitter day, and she had gone about the</p>\n<p>house with an expression in her face which Miss Minchin could not</p>\n<p>understand and which was a source of great annoyance to her, as it</p>\n<p>seemed as if the child were mentally living a life which held her above</p>\n<p>the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>It was as if she scarcely heard the rude and</p>\n<p>acid things said to her; or, if she heard them, did not care for them</p>\n<p>at all.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when she was in the midst of some harsh,</p>\n",
        "<p>domineering speech, Miss Minchin would find the still, unchildish eyes</p>\n<p>fixed upon her with something like a proud smile in them.</p>\n<p>At such</p>\n<p>times she did not know that Sara was saying to herself:</p>\n<p>\"You don't know that you are saying these things to a princess, and</p>\n<p>that if I chose I could wave my hand and order you to execution.</p>\n<p>I only</p>\n<p>spare you because I am a princess, and you are a poor, stupid, unkind,</p>\n<p>vulgar old thing, and don't know any better.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>This used to interest and amuse her more than anything else; and queer</p>\n<p>and fanciful as it was, she found comfort in it and it was a good thing</p>\n<p>for her.</p>\n<p>While the thought held possession of her, she could not be</p>\n<p>made rude and malicious by the rudeness and malice of those about her.</p>\n<p>\"A princess must be polite,\" she said to herself.</p>\n<p>And so when the servants, taking their tone from their mistress, were</p>\n<p>insolent and ordered her about, she would hold her head erect and reply</p>\n<p>to them with a quaint civility which often made them stare at her.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"She's got more airs and graces than if she come from Buckingham</p>\n<p>Palace, that young one,\" said the cook, chuckling a little sometimes.</p>\n<p>\"I lose my temper with her often enough, but I will say she never</p>\n<p>forgets her manners.</p>\n<p>'If you please, cook'; 'Will you be so kind,</p>\n<p>cook?'

        "<p>Being sad one night, I lay close to the open skylight and listened.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>vision she related told what this miserable room might be if it had</p>\n<p>comforts in it.</p>\n<p>She seemed to see it as she talked, and she grew</p>\n<p>cheered and warmed as she spoke.</p>\n<p>Then she came to this fancy; and the</p>\n<p>next day, the Sahib being ill and wretched, I told him of the thing to</p>\n<p>amuse him.</p>\n",
        "<p>It seemed then but a dream, but it pleased the Sahib.</p>\n<p>To</p>\n<p>hear of the child's doings gave him entertainment.</p>\n<p>He became interested</p>\n<p>in her and asked questions.</p>\n<p>At last he began to please himself with</p>\n<p>the thought of making her visions real things.\"</p>\n<p>\"You think that it can be done while she sleeps?</p>\n<p>Suppose she</p>\n",
        "<p>awakened,\" suggested the secretary; and it was evident that whatsoever</p>\n<p>the plan referred to was, it had caught and pleased his fancy as well</p>\n<p>as the Sahib Carrisford's.</p>\n<p>\"I can move as if my feet were of velvet,\" Ram Dass replied; \"and</p>\n<p>children sleep soundly--even the unhappy ones.</p>\n<p>I could have entered</p>\n<p>this room in the night many times, and without causing her to turn upon</p>\n<p>her pillow.</p>\n<p>If the other bearer passes to me the things through the</p>\n",

        "<p>They did not remain very long, to the great relief of Melchisedec, who,</p>\n<p>as he probably did not comprehend their conversation, felt their</p>\n<p>movements and whispers ominous.</p>\n<p>The young secretary seemed interested</p>\n<p>in everything.</p>\n<p>He wrote down things about the floor, the fireplace,</p>\n<p>the broken footstool, the old table, the walls--which last he touched</p>\n<p>with his hand again and again, seeming much pleased when he found that</p>\n<p>a number of old nails had been driven in various places.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"You can hang things on them,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Ram Dass smiled mysteriously.</p>\n<p>\"Yesterday, when she was out,\" he said, \"I entered, bringing with me</p>\n<p>small, sharp nails which can be pressed into the wall without blows</p>\n<p>from a hammer.</p>\n<p>I placed many in the plaster where I may need them.</p>\n<p>They are ready.\"</p>\n<p>The Indian gentleman's secretary stood still and looked round him as he</p>\n<p>thrust his tablets back into his pocket.</p>\n",

        "<p>entered it.</p>\n<p>And, after he was quite sure they had gone, Melchisedec</p>\n<p>was greatly relieved, and in the course of a few minutes felt it safe</p>\n<p>to emerge from his hole again and scuffle about in the hope that even</p>\n<p>such alarming human beings as these might have chanced to carry crumbs</p>\n<p>in their pockets and drop one or two of them.</p>\n<p>15</p>\n<p>The Magic</p>\n<p>When Sara had passed the house next door she had seen Ram Dass closing</p>\n",
        "<p>the shutters, and caught her glimpse of this room also.</p>\n<p>\"It is a long time since I saw a nice place from the inside,\" was the</p>\n<p>thought which crossed her mind.</p>\n<p>There was the usual bright fire glowing in the grate, and the Indian</p>\n<p>gentleman was sitting before it.</p>\n<p>His head was resting in his hand, and</p>\n<p>he looked as lonely and unhappy as ever.</p>\n<p>\"Poor man!\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I wonder what you are supposing.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>And this was what he was \"supposing\" at that very moment.</p>\n<p>\"Suppose,\" he was thinking, \"suppose--even if Carmichael traces the</p>\n<p>people to Moscow--the little girl they took from Madame Pascal's school</p>\n<p>in Paris is NOT the one we are in search of.</p>\n<p>Suppose she proves to be</p>\n<p>quite a different child.</p>\n<p>What steps shall I take next?\"</p>\n<p>When Sara went into the house she met Miss Minchin, who had come</p>\n<p>downstairs to scold the cook.</p>\n",

        "<p>She was only too rejoiced to have</p>\n<p>someone to vent her rage on, and Sara was a convenience, as usual.</p>\n<p>\"Why didn't you stay all night?\" she snapped.</p>\n<p>Sara laid her purchases on the table.</p>\n<p>\"Here are the things,\" she said.</p>\n<p>The cook looked them over, grumbling.</p>\n<p>She was in a very savage humor</p>\n<p>indeed.</p>\n<p>\"May I have something to eat?\"  Sara asked rather faintly.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Tea's over and done with,\" was the answer.</p>\n<p>\"Did you expect me to keep</p>\n<p>it hot for you?\"</p>\n<p>Sara stood silent for a second.</p>\n<p>\"I had no dinner,\" she said next, and her voice was quite low.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>made it low because she was afraid it would tremble.</p>\n<p>\"There's some bread in the pantry,\" said the cook.</p>\n<p>\"That's all you'll</p>\n",
        "<p>get at this time of day.\"</p>\n<p>Sara went and found the bread.</p>\n<p>It was old and hard and dry.</p>\n<p>The cook</p>\n<p>was in too vicious a humor to give her anything to eat with it.</p>\n<p>It was</p>\n<p>always safe and easy to vent her spite on Sara.</p>\n<p>Really, it was hard</p>\n<p>for the child to climb the three long flights of stairs leading to her</p>\n",
        "<p>attic.</p>\n<p>She often found them long and steep when she was tired; but</p>\n<p>tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top.</p>\n<p>Several times</p>\n<p>she was obliged to stop to rest.</p>\n<p>When she reached the top landing she</p>\n<p>was glad to see the glimmer of a light coming from under her door.</p>\n<p>That meant that Ermengarde had managed to creep up to pay her a visit.</p>\n<p>There was some comfort in that.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was better than to go into the room</p>\n<p>alone and find it empty and desolate.</p>\n<p>The mere presence of plump,</p>\n<p>comfortable Ermengarde, wrapped in her red shawl, would warm it a</p>\n<p>little.</p>\n<p>Yes; there Ermengarde was when she opened the door.</p>\n<p>She was sitting in</p>\n<p>the middle of the bed, with her feet tucked safely under her.</p>\n<p>She had</p>\n",

        "<p>\"Oh, Sara,\" she cried out, \"I am glad you have come.</p>\n<p>Melchy WOULD</p>\n<p>sniff about so.</p>\n<p>I tried to coax him to go back, but he wouldn't for</p>\n<p>such a long time.</p>\n<p>I like him, you know; but it does frighten me when</p>\n<p>he sniffs right at me.</p>\n<p>Do you think he ever WOULD jump?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" answered Sara.</p>\n",
        "<p>Ermengarde crawled forward on the bed to look at her.</p>\n<p>\"You DO look tired, Sara,\" she said; \"you are quite pale.\"</p>\n<p>\"I AM tired,\" said Sara, dropping on to the lopsided footstool.</p>\n<p>\"Oh,</p>\n<p>there's Melchisedec, poor thing.</p>\n<p>He's come to ask for his supper.\"</p>\n<p>Melchisedec had come out of his hole as if he had been listening for</p>\n<p>her footstep.</p>\n<p>Sara was quite sure he knew it.</p>\n",
        "<p>He came forward with an</p>\n<p>affectionate, expectant expression as Sara put her hand in her pocket</p>\n<p>and turned it inside out, shaking her head.</p>\n<p>\"I'm very sorry,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"I haven't one crumb left.</p>\n<p>Go home,</p>\n<p>Melchisedec, and tell your wife there was nothing in my pocket.</p>\n<p>I'm</p>\n<p>afraid I forgot because the cook and Miss Minchin were so cross.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Melchisedec seemed to understand.</p>\n<p>He shuffled resignedly, if not</p>\n<p>contentedly, back to his home.</p>\n<p>\"I did not expect to see you tonight, Ermie,\" Sara said.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde</p>\n<p>hugged herself in the red shawl.</p>\n<p>\"Miss Amelia has gone out to spend the night with her old aunt,\" she</p>\n<p>explained.</p>\n<p>\"No one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms after</p>\n",

        "<p>Sara looked round and got up at once.</p>\n<p>She ran to the table, and</p>\n<p>picking up the top volume, turned over its leaves quickly.</p>\n<p>For the</p>\n<p>moment she forgot her discomforts.</p>\n<p>\"Ah,\" she cried out, \"how beautiful!</p>\n<p>Carlyle's French Revolution.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>have SO wanted to read that!\"</p>\n",

        "<p>books--I want them!\"  And her eyes grew big, and her chest heaved.</p>\n<p>\"Take them, then,\" said Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"I wish I wanted them--but I</p>\n<p>don't.</p>\n<p>I'm not clever, and my father is, and he thinks I ought to be.\"</p>\n<p>Sara was opening one book after the other.</p>\n<p>\"What are you going to tell</p>\n<p>your father?\" she asked, a slight doubt dawning in her mind.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, he needn't know,\" answered Ermengarde.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"He'll think I've read</p>\n<p>them.\"</p>\n<p>Sara put down her book and shook her head slowly.</p>\n<p>\"That's almost like</p>\n<p>telling lies,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"And lies--well, you see, they are not only</p>\n<p>wicked--they're VULGAR.</p>\n<p>Sometimes\"--reflectively--\"I've thought perhaps</p>\n<p>I might do something wicked--I might suddenly fly into a rage and kill</p>\n",

        "<p>\"If you can't,</p>\n<p>you can't.</p>\n<p>If I can--why, I can; that's all.\"</p>\n<p>She always felt very tender of Ermengarde, and tried not to let her</p>\n<p>feel too strongly the difference between being able to learn anything</p>\n<p>at once, and not being able to learn anything at all.</p>\n<p>As she looked at</p>\n<p>her plump face, one of her wise, old-fashioned thoughts came to her.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps,\" she said, \"to be able to learn things quickly isn't</p>\n",
        "<p>everything.</p>\n<p>To be kind is worth a great deal to other people.</p>\n<p>If Miss</p>\n<p>Minchin knew everything on earth and was like what she is now, she'd</p>\n<p>still be a detestable thing, and everybody would hate her.</p>\n<p>Lots of</p>\n<p>clever people have done harm and have been wicked.</p>\n<p>Look at</p>\n<p>Robespierre--\"</p>\n",
        "<p>She stopped and examined Ermengarde's countenance, which was beginning</p>\n<p>to look bewildered.</p>\n<p>\"Don't you remember?\" she demanded.</p>\n<p>\"I told you</p>\n<p>about him not long ago.</p>\n<p>I believe you've forgotten.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, I don't remember ALL of it,\" admitted Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"Well, you wait a minute,\" said Sara, \"and I'll take off my wet things</p>\n<p>and wrap myself in the coverlet and tell you over again.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>She took off her hat and coat and hung them on a nail against the wall,</p>\n<p>and she changed her wet shoes for an old pair of slippers.</p>\n<p>Then she</p>\n<p>jumped on the bed, and drawing the coverlet about her shoulders, sat</p>\n<p>with her arms round her knees.</p>\n<p>\"Now, listen,\" she said.</p>\n<p>She plunged into the gory records of the French Revolution, and told</p>\n<p>such stories of it that Ermengarde's eyes grew round with alarm and she</p>\n<p>held her breath.</p>\n",
        "<p>But though she was rather terrified, there was a</p>\n<p>delightful thrill in listening, and she was not likely to forget</p>\n<p>Robespierre again, or to have any doubts about the Princesse de</p>\n<p>Lamballe.</p>\n<p>\"You know they put her head on a pike and danced round it,\" Sara</p>\n<p>explained.</p>\n<p>\"And she had beautiful floating blonde hair; and when I</p>\n<p>think of her, I never see her head on her body, but always on a pike,</p>\n<p>with those furious people dancing and howling.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>It was agreed that Mr.</p>\n<p>St.</p>\n<p>John was to be told the plan they had made,</p>\n<p>and for the present the books were to be left in the attic.</p>\n<p>\"Now let's tell each other things,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"How are you getting on</p>\n<p>with your French lessons?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ever so much better since the last time I came up here and you</p>\n<p>explained the conjugations.</p>\n",

        "<p>and though sometimes Sara looked rather pale, and it was not to be</p>\n<p>denied that she had grown very thin, her proud little spirit would not</p>\n<p>admit of complaints.</p>\n<p>She had never confessed that at times she was</p>\n<p>almost ravenous with hunger, as she was tonight.</p>\n<p>She was growing</p>\n<p>rapidly, and her constant walking and running about would have given</p>\n<p>her a keen appetite even if she had had abundant and regular meals of a</p>\n<p>much more nourishing nature than the unappetizing, inferior food</p>\n",
        "<p>snatched at such odd times as suited the kitchen convenience.</p>\n<p>She was</p>\n<p>growing used to a certain gnawing feeling in her young stomach.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose soldiers feel like this when they are on a long and weary</p>\n<p>march,\" she often said to herself.</p>\n<p>She liked the sound of the phrase,</p>\n<p>\"long and weary march.\"  It made her feel rather like a soldier.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>had also a quaint sense of being a hostess in the attic.</p>\n",

        "<p>\"I was 'ungry enough, but 't</p>\n<p>warn't me--never!\"</p>\n<p>\"You deserve to be sent to prison,\" said Miss Minchin's voice.</p>\n<p>\"Picking and stealing!</p>\n<p>Half a meat pie, indeed!\"</p>\n<p>\"'T warn't me,\" wept Becky.</p>\n<p>\"I could 'ave eat a whole un--but I never</p>\n<p>laid a finger on it.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin was out of breath between temper and mounting the stairs.</p>\n",
        "<p>The meat pie had been intended for her special late supper.</p>\n<p>It became</p>\n<p>apparent that she boxed Becky's ears.</p>\n<p>\"Don't tell falsehoods,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Go to your room this instant.\"</p>\n<p>Both Sara and Ermengarde heard the slap, and then heard Becky run in</p>\n<p>her slipshod shoes up the stairs and into her attic.</p>\n<p>They heard her</p>\n<p>door shut, and knew that she threw herself upon her bed.</p>\n",

        "<p>by it.</p>\n<p>Sara was crying!</p>\n<p>The unconquerable Sara!</p>\n<p>It seemed to denote</p>\n<p>something new--some mood she had never known.</p>\n<p>Suppose--suppose--a new</p>\n<p>dread possibility presented itself to her kind, slow, little mind all</p>\n<p>at once.</p>\n<p>She crept off the bed in the dark and found her way to the</p>\n",
        "<p>table where the candle stood.</p>\n<p>She struck a match and lit the candle.</p>\n<p>When she had lighted it, she bent forward and looked at Sara, with her</p>\n<p>new thought growing to definite fear in her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Sara,\" she said in a timid, almost awe-stricken voice, \"are--are--you</p>\n<p>never told me--I don't want to be rude, but--are YOU ever hungry?\"</p>\n<p>It was too much just at that moment.</p>\n<p>The barrier broke down.</p>\n<p>Sara</p>\n",
        "<p>lifted her face from her hands.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" she said in a new passionate way.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I am.</p>\n<p>I'm so hungry</p>\n<p>now that I could almost eat you.</p>\n<p>And it makes it worse to hear poor</p>\n<p>Becky.</p>\n<p>She's hungrier than I am.\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde gasped.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Oh, oh!\" she cried woefully.</p>\n<p>\"And I never knew!\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't want you to know,\" Sara said.</p>\n<p>\"It would have made me feel</p>\n<p>like a street beggar.</p>\n<p>I know I look like a street beggar.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, you don't--you don't!\" Ermengarde broke in.</p>\n<p>\"Your clothes are a</p>\n<p>little queer--but you couldn't look like a street beggar.</p>\n",
        "<p>You haven't</p>\n<p>a street-beggar face.\"</p>\n<p>\"A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity,\" said Sara, with a</p>\n<p>short little laugh in spite of herself.</p>\n<p>\"Here it is.\" And she pulled</p>\n<p>out the thin ribbon from her neck.</p>\n<p>\"He wouldn't have given me his</p>\n<p>Christmas sixpence if I hadn't looked as if I needed it.\"</p>\n<p>Somehow the sight of the dear little sixpence was good for both of</p>\n",
        "<p>them.</p>\n<p>It made them laugh a little, though they both had tears in their</p>\n<p>eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Who was he?\" asked Ermengarde, looking at it quite as if it had not</p>\n<p>been a mere ordinary silver sixpence.</p>\n<p>\"He was a darling little thing going to a party,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"He was</p>\n<p>one of the Large Family, the little one with the round legs--the one I</p>\n<p>call Guy Clarence.</p>\n",
        "<p>I suppose his nursery was crammed with Christmas</p>\n<p>presents and hampers full of cakes and things, and he could see I had</p>\n<p>nothing.\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde gave a little jump backward.</p>\n<p>The last sentences had</p>\n<p>recalled something to her troubled mind and given her a sudden</p>\n<p>inspiration.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Sara!\" she cried.</p>\n<p>\"What a silly thing I am not to have thought of</p>\n",
        "<p>it!\"</p>\n<p>\"Of what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Something splendid!\" said Ermengarde, in an excited hurry.</p>\n<p>\"This very</p>\n<p>afternoon my nicest aunt sent me a box.</p>\n<p>It is full of good things.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>never touched it, I had so much pudding at dinner, and I was so</p>\n<p>bothered about papa's books.\"  Her words began to tumble over each</p>\n",
        "<p>other.</p>\n<p>\"It's got cake in it, and little meat pies, and jam tarts and</p>\n<p>buns, and oranges and red-currant wine, and figs and chocolate.</p>\n<p>I'll</p>\n<p>creep back to my room and get it this minute, and we'll eat it now.\"</p>\n<p>Sara almost reeled.</p>\n<p>When one is faint with hunger the mention of food</p>\n<p>has sometimes a curious effect.</p>\n<p>She clutched Ermengarde's arm.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Do you think--you COULD?\" she ejaculated.</p>\n<p>\"I know I could,\" answered Ermengarde, and she ran to the door--opened</p>\n<p>it softly--put her head out into the darkness, and listened.</p>\n<p>Then she</p>\n<p>went back to Sara.</p>\n<p>\"The lights are out.</p>\n<p>Everybody's in bed.</p>\n<p>I can</p>\n<p>creep--and creep--and no one will hear.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>It was so delightful that they caught each other's hands and a sudden</p>\n<p>light sprang into Sara's eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Ermie!\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Let us PRETEND!</p>\n<p>Let us pretend it's a party!</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>oh, won't you invite the prisoner in the next cell?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes!</p>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n",
        "<p>Let us knock on the wall now.</p>\n<p>The jailer won't hear.\"</p>\n<p>Sara went to the wall.</p>\n<p>Through it she could hear poor Becky crying</p>\n<p>more softly.</p>\n<p>She knocked four times.</p>\n<p>\"That means, 'Come to me through the secret passage under the wall,'</p>\n<p>she explained.</p>\n<p>'I have something to communicate.'\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Five quick knocks answered her.</p>\n<p>\"She is coming,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately the door of the attic opened and Becky appeared.</p>\n<p>Her</p>\n<p>eyes were red and her cap was sliding off, and when she caught sight of</p>\n<p>Ermengarde she began to rub her face nervously with her apron.</p>\n<p>\"Don't mind me a bit, Becky!\" cried Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in,\" said Sara, \"because she is</p>\n<p>going to bring a box of good things up here to us.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Becky's cap almost fell off entirely, she broke in with such excitement.</p>\n<p>\"To eat, miss?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Things that's good to eat?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Sara, \"and we are going to pretend a party.\"</p>\n<p>\"And you shall have as much as you WANT to eat,\" put in Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"I'll go this minute!\"</p>\n<p>She was in such haste that as she tiptoed out of the attic she dropped</p>\n<p>her red shawl and did not know it had fallen.</p>\n<p>No one saw it for a</p>\n",
        "<p>minute or so.</p>\n<p>Becky was too much overpowered by the good luck which</p>\n<p>had befallen her.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, miss!</p>\n<p>oh, miss!\" she gasped; \"I know it was you that asked her to</p>\n<p>let me come.</p>\n<p>It--it makes me cry to think of it.\"  And she went to</p>\n<p>Sara's side and stood and looked at her worshipingly.</p>\n<p>But in Sara's hungry eyes the old light had begun to glow and transform</p>\n",
        "<p>her world for her.</p>\n<p>Here in the attic--with the cold night</p>\n<p>outside--with the afternoon in the sloppy streets barely passed--with</p>\n<p>the memory of the awful unfed look in the beggar child's eyes not yet</p>\n<p>faded--this simple, cheerful thing had happened like a thing of magic.</p>\n<p>She caught her breath.</p>\n<p>\"Somehow, something always happens,\" she cried, \"just before things get</p>\n<p>to the very worst.</p>\n<p>It is as if the Magic did it.</p>\n",
        "<p>If I could only just</p>\n<p>remember that always.</p>\n<p>The worst thing never QUITE comes.\"</p>\n<p>She gave Becky a little cheerful shake.</p>\n<p>\"No, no!</p>\n<p>You mustn't cry!\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"We must make haste and set the</p>\n<p>table.\"</p>\n<p>\"Set the table, miss?\" said Becky, gazing round the room.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"What'll we</p>\n<p>set it with?\"</p>\n<p>Sara looked round the attic, too.</p>\n<p>\"There doesn't seem to be much,\" she answered, half laughing.</p>\n<p>That moment she saw something and pounced upon it.</p>\n<p>It was Ermengarde's</p>\n<p>red shawl which lay upon the floor.</p>\n<p>\"Here's the shawl,\" she cried.</p>\n<p>\"I know she won't mind it.</p>\n",
        "<p>It will make</p>\n<p>such a nice red tablecloth.\"</p>\n<p>They pulled the old table forward, and threw the shawl over it.</p>\n<p>Red is</p>\n<p>a wonderfully kind and comfortable color.</p>\n<p>It began to make the room</p>\n<p>look furnished directly.</p>\n<p>\"How nice a red rug would look on the floor!\" exclaimed Sara.</p>\n<p>\"We must</p>\n",
        "<p>pretend there is one!\"</p>\n<p>Her eye swept the bare boards with a swift glance of admiration.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>rug was laid down already.</p>\n<p>\"How soft and thick it is!\" she said, with the little laugh which Becky</p>\n<p>knew the meaning of; and she raised and set her foot down again</p>\n<p>delicately, as if she felt something under it.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, miss,\" answered Becky, watching her with serious rapture.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",
        "<p>was always quite serious.</p>\n<p>\"What next, now?\" said Sara, and she stood still and put her hands over</p>\n<p>her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Something will come if I think and wait a little\"--in a</p>\n<p>soft, expectant voice.</p>\n<p>\"The Magic will tell me.\"</p>\n<p>One of her favorite fancies was that on \"the outside,\" as she called</p>\n<p>it, thoughts were waiting for people to call them.</p>\n<p>Becky had seen her</p>\n",
        "<p>stand and wait many a time before, and knew that in a few seconds she</p>\n<p>would uncover an enlightened, laughing face.</p>\n<p>In a moment she did.</p>\n<p>\"There!\" she cried.</p>\n<p>\"It has come!</p>\n<p>I know now!</p>\n<p>I must look among the</p>\n<p>things in the old trunk I had when I was a princess.\"</p>\n<p>She flew to its corner and kneeled down.</p>\n",
        "<p>It had not been put in the</p>\n<p>attic for her benefit, but because there was no room for it elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Nothing had been left in it but rubbish.</p>\n<p>But she knew she should find</p>\n<p>something.</p>\n<p>The Magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or</p>\n<p>another.</p>\n<p>In a corner lay a package so insignificant-looking that it had been</p>\n<p>overlooked, and when she herself had found it she had kept it as a</p>\n",
        "<p>relic.</p>\n<p>It contained a dozen small white handkerchiefs.</p>\n<p>She seized</p>\n<p>them joyfully and ran to the table.</p>\n<p>She began to arrange them upon the</p>\n<p>red table-cover, patting and coaxing them into shape with the narrow</p>\n<p>lace edge curling outward, her Magic working its spells for her as she</p>\n<p>did it.</p>\n<p>\"These are the plates,\" she said.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"They are golden plates.</p>\n<p>These are</p>\n<p>the richly embroidered napkins.</p>\n<p>Nuns worked them in convents in Spain.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did they, miss?\" breathed Becky, her very soul uplifted by the</p>\n<p>information.</p>\n<p>\"You must pretend it,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"If you pretend it enough, you will</p>\n<p>see them.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Yes, miss,\" said Becky; and as Sara returned to the trunk she devoted</p>\n<p>herself to the effort of accomplishing an end so much to be desired.</p>\n<p>Sara turned suddenly to find her standing by the table, looking very</p>\n<p>queer indeed.</p>\n<p>She had shut her eyes, and was twisting her face in</p>\n<p>strange convulsive contortions, her hands hanging stiffly clenched at</p>\n<p>her sides.</p>\n<p>She looked as if she was trying to lift some enormous</p>\n<p>weight.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"What is the matter, Becky?\"  Sara cried.</p>\n<p>\"What are you doing?\"</p>\n<p>Becky opened her eyes with a start.</p>\n<p>\"I was a-'pretendin',' miss,\" she answered a little sheepishly; \"I was</p>\n<p>tryin' to see it like you do.</p>\n<p>I almost did,\" with a hopeful grin.</p>\n<p>\"But</p>\n<p>it takes a lot o' stren'th.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps it does if you are not used to it,\" said Sara, with friendly</p>\n",
        "<p>sympathy; \"but you don't know how easy it is when you've done it often.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't try so hard just at first.</p>\n<p>It will come to you after a</p>\n<p>while.</p>\n<p>I'll just tell you what things are.</p>\n<p>Look at these.\"</p>\n<p>She held an old summer hat in her hand which she had fished out of the</p>\n<p>bottom of the trunk.</p>\n<p>There was a wreath of flowers on it.</p>\n",
        "<p>She pulled</p>\n<p>the wreath off.</p>\n<p>\"These are garlands for the feast,\" she said grandly.</p>\n<p>\"They fill all</p>\n<p>the air with perfume.</p>\n<p>There's a mug on the wash-stand, Becky.</p>\n<p>Oh--and</p>\n<p>bring the soap dish for a centerpiece.\"</p>\n<p>Becky handed them to her reverently.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"What are they now, miss?\" she inquired.</p>\n<p>\"You'd think they was made of</p>\n<p>crockery--but I know they ain't.\"</p>\n<p>\"This is a carven flagon,\" said Sara, arranging tendrils of the wreath</p>\n<p>about the mug.</p>\n<p>\"And this\"--bending tenderly over the soap dish and</p>\n<p>heaping it with roses--\"is purest alabaster encrusted with gems.\"</p>\n<p>She touched the things gently, a happy smile hovering about her lips</p>\n<p>which made her look as if she were a creature in a dream.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"My, ain't it lovely!\" whispered Becky.</p>\n<p>\"If we just had something for bonbon dishes,\" Sara murmured.</p>\n<p>\"There!\"--darting to the trunk again.</p>\n<p>\"I remember I saw something this</p>\n<p>minute.\"</p>\n<p>It was only a bundle of wool wrapped in red and white tissue paper, but</p>\n<p>the tissue paper was soon twisted into the form of little dishes, and</p>\n<p>was combined with the remaining flowers to ornament the candlestick</p>\n<p>which was to light the feast.</p>\n",
        "<p>Only the Magic could have made it more</p>\n<p>than an old table covered with a red shawl and set with rubbish from a</p>\n<p>long-unopened trunk.</p>\n<p>But Sara drew back and gazed at it, seeing</p>\n<p>wonders; and Becky, after staring in delight, spoke with bated breath.</p>\n<p>\"This 'ere,\" she suggested, with a glance round the attic--\"is it the</p>\n<p>Bastille now--or has it turned into somethin' different?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yes, yes!\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Quite different.</p>\n",
        "<p>It is a banquet hall!\"</p>\n<p>\"My eye, miss!\" ejaculated Becky.</p>\n<p>\"A blanket 'all!\" and she turned to</p>\n<p>view the splendors about her with awed bewilderment.</p>\n<p>\"A banquet hall,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"A vast chamber where feasts are given.</p>\n<p>It has a vaulted roof, and a minstrels' gallery, and a huge chimney</p>\n<p>filled with blazing oaken logs, and it is brilliant with waxen tapers</p>\n<p>twinkling on every side.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"My eye, Miss Sara!\" gasped Becky again.</p>\n<p>Then the door opened, and Ermengarde came in, rather staggering under</p>\n<p>the weight of her hamper.</p>\n<p>She started back with an exclamation of joy.</p>\n<p>To enter from the chill darkness outside, and find one's self</p>\n<p>confronted by a totally unanticipated festal board, draped with red,</p>\n<p>adorned with white napery, and wreathed with flowers, was to feel that</p>\n<p>the preparations were brilliant indeed.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Sara!\" she cried out.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"You are the cleverest girl I ever saw!\"</p>\n<p>\"Isn't it nice?\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"They are things out of my old trunk.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>asked my Magic, and it told me to go and look.\"</p>\n<p>\"But oh, miss,\" cried Becky, \"wait till she's told you what they are!</p>\n<p>They ain't just--oh, miss, please tell her,\" appealing to Sara.</p>\n<p>So Sara told her, and because her Magic helped her she made her ALMOST</p>\n<p>see it all:  the golden platters--the vaulted spaces--the blazing</p>\n",
        "<p>logs--the twinkling waxen tapers.</p>\n<p>As the things were taken out of the</p>\n<p>hamper--the frosted cakes--the fruits--the bonbons and the wine--the</p>\n<p>feast became a splendid thing.</p>\n<p>\"It's like a real party!\" cried Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"It's like a queen's table,\" sighed Becky.</p>\n<p>Then Ermengarde had a sudden brilliant thought.</p>\n<p>\"I'll tell you what, Sara,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Pretend you are a princess now</p>\n",
        "<p>and this is a royal feast.\"</p>\n<p>\"But it's your feast,\" said Sara; \"you must be the princess, and we</p>\n<p>will be your maids of honor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I can't,\" said Ermengarde.</p>\n<p>\"I'm too fat, and I don't know how.</p>\n<p>YOU be her.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, if you want me to,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>But suddenly she thought of something else and ran to the rusty grate.</p>\n<p>\"There is a lot of paper and rubbish stuffed in here!\" she exclaimed.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"If we light it, there will be a bright blaze for a few minutes, and we</p>\n<p>shall feel as if it was a real fire.\"  She struck a match and lighted</p>\n<p>it up with a great specious glow which illuminated the room.</p>\n<p>\"By the time it stops blazing,\" Sara said, \"we shall forget about its</p>\n<p>not being real.\"</p>\n<p>She stood in the dancing glow and smiled.</p>\n<p>\"Doesn't it LOOK real?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Now we will begin the party.\"</p>\n<p>She led the way to the table.</p>\n",
        "<p>She waved her hand graciously to</p>\n<p>Ermengarde and Becky.</p>\n<p>She was in the midst of her dream.</p>\n<p>\"Advance, fair damsels,\" she said in her happy dream-voice, \"and be</p>\n<p>seated at the banquet table.</p>\n<p>My noble father, the king, who is absent</p>\n<p>on a long journey, has commanded me to feast you.\" She turned her head</p>\n<p>slightly toward the corner of the room.</p>\n<p>\"What, ho, there, minstrels!</p>\n",
        "<p>Strike up with your viols and bassoons.</p>\n<p>Princesses,\" she explained</p>\n<p>rapidly to Ermengarde and Becky, \"always had minstrels to play at their</p>\n<p>feasts.</p>\n<p>Pretend there is a minstrel gallery up there in the corner.</p>\n<p>Now we will begin.\"</p>\n<p>They had barely had time to take their pieces of cake into their</p>\n<p>hands--not one of them had time to do more, when--they all three sprang</p>\n<p>to their feet and turned pale faces toward the</p>\n",
        "<p>door--listening--listening.</p>\n<p>Someone was coming up the stairs.</p>\n<p>There was no mistake about it.</p>\n<p>Each</p>\n<p>of them recognized the angry, mounting tread and knew that the end of</p>\n<p>all things had come.</p>\n<p>\"It's--the missus!\" choked Becky, and dropped her piece of cake upon</p>\n<p>the floor.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Sara, her eyes growing shocked and large in her small white</p>\n",
        "<p>face.</p>\n<p>\"Miss Minchin has found us out.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin struck the door open with a blow of her hand.</p>\n<p>She was pale</p>\n<p>herself, but it was with rage.</p>\n<p>She looked from the frightened faces to</p>\n<p>the banquet table, and from the banquet table to the last flicker of</p>\n<p>the burnt paper in the grate.</p>\n<p>\"I have been suspecting something of this sort,\" she exclaimed; \"but I</p>\n",
        "<p>did not dream of such audacity.</p>\n<p>Lavinia was telling the truth.\"</p>\n<p>So they knew that it was Lavinia who had somehow guessed their secret</p>\n<p>and had betrayed them.</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin strode over to Becky and boxed her</p>\n<p>ears for a second time.</p>\n<p>\"You impudent creature!\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"You leave the house in the</p>\n<p>morning!\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Sara stood quite still, her eyes growing larger, her face paler.</p>\n<p>Ermengarde burst into tears.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, don't send her away,\" she sobbed.</p>\n<p>\"My aunt sent me the hamper.</p>\n<p>We're--only--having a party.\"</p>\n<p>\"So I see,\" said Miss Minchin, witheringly.</p>\n<p>\"With the Princess Sara at</p>\n<p>the head of the table.\"  She turned fiercely on Sara.</p>\n<p>\"It is your</p>\n",

        "<p>There were even blankets enough to share with Becky.</p>\n<p>The narrow couch</p>\n<p>in the next attic was more comfortable that night than its occupant had</p>\n<p>ever dreamed that it could be.</p>\n<p>As she went out of the room, Becky turned upon the threshold and looked</p>\n<p>about her with devouring eyes.</p>\n<p>\"If it ain't here in the mornin', miss,\" she said, \"it's been here</p>\n<p>tonight, anyways, an' I shan't never forget it.\"  She looked at each</p>\n<p>particular thing, as if to commit it to memory.</p>\n",

        "<p>Ermengarde could be</p>\n<p>told the story and trusted to keep it secret.</p>\n<p>If Lottie made any</p>\n<p>discoveries, she could be bound to secrecy also.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Magic</p>\n<p>itself would help to hide its own marvels.</p>\n<p>\"But whatever happens,\" Sara kept saying to herself all day--\"WHATEVER</p>\n<p>happens, somewhere in the world there is a heavenly kind person who is</p>\n<p>my friend--my friend.</p>\n",
        "<p>If I never know who it is--if I never can even</p>\n<p>thank him--I shall never feel quite so lonely.</p>\n<p>Oh, the Magic was GOOD</p>\n<p>to me!\"</p>\n<p>If it was possible for weather to be worse than it had been the day</p>\n<p>before, it was worse this day--wetter, muddier, colder.</p>\n<p>There were</p>\n<p>more errands to be done, the cook was more irritable, and, knowing that</p>\n<p>Sara was in disgrace, she was more savage.</p>\n",
        "<p>But what does anything</p>\n<p>matter when one's Magic has just proved itself one's friend.</p>\n<p>Sara's</p>\n<p>supper of the night before had given her strength, she knew that she</p>\n<p>should sleep well and warmly, and, even though she had naturally begun</p>\n<p>to be hungry again before evening, she felt that she could bear it</p>\n<p>until breakfast-time on the following day, when her meals would surely</p>\n<p>be given to her again.</p>\n<p>It was quite late when she was at last allowed</p>\n",
        "<p>to go upstairs.</p>\n<p>She had been told to go into the schoolroom and study</p>\n<p>until ten o'clock, and she had become interested in her work, and</p>\n<p>remained over her books later.</p>\n<p>When she reached the top flight of stairs and stood before the attic</p>\n<p>door, it must be confessed that her heart beat rather fast.</p>\n<p>\"Of course it MIGHT all have been taken away,\" she whispered, trying to</p>\n<p>be brave.</p>\n<p>\"It might only have been lent to me for just that one awful</p>\n",
        "<p>night.</p>\n<p>But it WAS lent to me--I had it.</p>\n<p>It was real.\"</p>\n<p>She pushed the door open and went in.</p>\n<p>Once inside, she gasped</p>\n<p>slightly, shut the door, and stood with her back against it looking</p>\n<p>from side to side.</p>\n<p>The Magic had been there again.</p>\n<p>It actually had, and it had done even</p>\n",
        "<p>more than before.</p>\n<p>The fire was blazing, in lovely leaping flames, more</p>\n<p>merrily than ever.</p>\n<p>A number of new things had been brought into the</p>\n<p>attic which so altered the look of it that if she had not been past</p>\n<p>doubting she would have rubbed her eyes.</p>\n<p>Upon the low table another</p>\n<p>supper stood--this time with cups and plates for Becky as well as</p>\n<p>herself; a piece of bright, heavy, strange embroidery covered the</p>\n",
        "<p>battered mantel, and on it some ornaments had been placed.</p>\n<p>All the</p>\n<p>bare, ugly things which could be covered with draperies had been</p>\n<p>concealed and made to look quite pretty.</p>\n<p>Some odd materials of rich</p>\n<p>colors had been fastened against the wall with fine, sharp tacks--so</p>\n<p>sharp that they could be pressed into the wood and plaster without</p>\n<p>hammering.</p>\n<p>Some brilliant fans were pinned up, and there were several</p>\n",
        "<p>large cushions, big and substantial enough to use as seats.</p>\n<p>A wooden</p>\n<p>box was covered with a rug, and some cushions lay on it, so that it</p>\n<p>wore quite the air of a sofa.</p>\n<p>Sara slowly moved away from the door and simply sat down and looked and</p>\n<p>looked again.</p>\n<p>\"It is exactly like something fairy come true,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"There isn't</p>\n<p>the least difference.</p>\n",
        "<p>I feel as if I might wish for anything--diamonds</p>\n<p>or bags of gold--and they would appear!</p>\n<p>THAT wouldn't be any stranger</p>\n<p>than this.</p>\n<p>Is this my garret?</p>\n<p>Am I the same cold, ragged, damp Sara?</p>\n<p>And to think I used to pretend and pretend and wish there were fairies!</p>\n<p>The one thing I always wanted was to see a fairy story come true.</p>\n<p>I am</p>\n",
        "<p>LIVING in a fairy story.</p>\n<p>I feel as if I might be a fairy myself, and</p>\n<p>able to turn things into anything else.\"</p>\n<p>She rose and knocked upon the wall for the prisoner in the next cell,</p>\n<p>and the prisoner came.</p>\n<p>When she entered she almost dropped in a heap upon the floor.</p>\n<p>For a</p>\n<p>few seconds she quite lost her breath.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, laws!\" she gasped.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Oh, laws, miss!\"</p>\n<p>\"You see,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>On this night Becky sat on a cushion upon the hearth rug and had a cup</p>\n<p>and saucer of her own.</p>\n<p>When Sara went to bed she found that she had a new thick mattress and</p>\n<p>big downy pillows.</p>\n<p>Her old mattress and pillow had been removed to</p>\n<p>Becky's bedstead, and, consequently, with these additions Becky had</p>\n<p>been supplied with unheard-of comfort.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Where does it all come from?\"  Becky broke forth once.</p>\n<p>\"Laws, who does</p>\n<p>it, miss?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't let us even ASK,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"If it were not that I want to</p>\n<p>say, 'Oh, thank you,' I would rather not know.</p>\n<p>It makes it more</p>\n<p>beautiful.\"</p>\n<p>From that time life became more wonderful day by day.</p>\n",
        "<p>The fairy story</p>\n<p>continued.</p>\n<p>Almost every day something new was done.</p>\n<p>Some new comfort</p>\n<p>or ornament appeared each time Sara opened the door at night, until in</p>\n<p>a short time the attic was a beautiful little room full of all sorts of</p>\n<p>odd and luxurious things.</p>\n<p>The ugly walls were gradually entirely</p>\n<p>covered with pictures and draperies, ingenious pieces of folding</p>\n",
        "<p>furniture appeared, a bookshelf was hung up and filled with books, new</p>\n<p>comforts and conveniences appeared one by one, until there seemed</p>\n<p>nothing left to be desired.</p>\n<p>When Sara went downstairs in the morning,</p>\n<p>the remains of the supper were on the table; and when she returned to</p>\n<p>the attic in the evening, the magician had removed them and left</p>\n<p>another nice little meal.</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin was as harsh and insulting as</p>\n<p>ever, Miss Amelia as peevish, and the servants were as vulgar and rude.</p>\n",
        "<p>Sara was sent on errands in all weathers, and scolded and driven hither</p>\n<p>and thither; she was scarcely allowed to speak to Ermengarde and</p>\n<p>Lottie; Lavinia sneered at the increasing shabbiness of her clothes;</p>\n<p>and the other girls stared curiously at her when she appeared in the</p>\n<p>schoolroom.</p>\n<p>But what did it all matter while she was living in this</p>\n<p>wonderful mysterious story?</p>\n<p>It was more romantic and delightful than</p>\n<p>anything she had ever invented to comfort her starved young soul and</p>\n",
        "<p>save herself from despair.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when she was scolded, she could</p>\n<p>scarcely keep from smiling.</p>\n<p>\"If you only knew!\" she was saying to herself.</p>\n<p>\"If you only knew!\"</p>\n<p>The comfort and happiness she enjoyed were making her stronger, and she</p>\n<p>had them always to look forward to.</p>\n<p>If she came home from her errands</p>\n<p>wet and tired and hungry, she knew she would soon be warm and well fed</p>\n",
        "<p>after she had climbed the stairs.</p>\n<p>During the hardest day she could</p>\n<p>occupy herself blissfully by thinking of what she should see when she</p>\n<p>opened the attic door, and wondering what new delight had been prepared</p>\n<p>for her.</p>\n<p>In a very short time she began to look less thin.</p>\n<p>Color came</p>\n<p>into her cheeks, and her eyes did not seem so much too big for her face.</p>\n<p>\"Sara Crewe looks wonderfully well,\" Miss Minchin remarked</p>\n",
        "<p>disapprovingly to her sister.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered poor, silly Miss Amelia.</p>\n<p>\"She is absolutely fattening.</p>\n<p>She was beginning to look like a little starved crow.\"</p>\n<p>\"Starved!\" exclaimed Miss Minchin, angrily.</p>\n<p>\"There was no reason why</p>\n<p>she should look starved.</p>\n<p>She always had plenty to eat!\"</p>\n<p>\"Of--of course,\" agreed Miss Amelia, humbly, alarmed to find that she</p>\n",
        "<p>had, as usual, said the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>\"There is something very disagreeable in seeing that sort of thing in a</p>\n<p>child of her age,\" said Miss Minchin, with haughty vagueness.</p>\n<p>\"What--sort of thing?\"  Miss Amelia ventured.</p>\n<p>\"It might almost be called defiance,\" answered Miss Minchin, feeling</p>\n<p>annoyed because she knew the thing she resented was nothing like</p>\n<p>defiance, and she did not know what other unpleasant term to use.</p>\n<p>\"The</p>\n<p>spirit and will of any other child would have been entirely humbled and</p>\n",
        "<p>broken by--by the changes she has had to submit to.</p>\n<p>But, upon my word,</p>\n<p>she seems as little subdued as if--as if she were a princess.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you remember,\" put in the unwise Miss Amelia, \"what she said to you</p>\n<p>that day in the schoolroom about what you would do if you found out</p>\n<p>that she was--\"</p>\n<p>\"No, I don't,\" said Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"Don't talk nonsense.\" But she</p>\n<p>remembered very clearly indeed.</p>\n",
        "<p>Very naturally, even Becky was beginning to look plumper and less</p>\n<p>frightened.</p>\n<p>She could not help it.</p>\n<p>She had her share in the secret</p>\n<p>fairy story, too.</p>\n<p>She had two mattresses, two pillows, plenty of</p>\n<p>bed-covering, and every night a hot supper and a seat on the cushions</p>\n<p>by the fire.</p>\n<p>The Bastille had melted away, the prisoners no longer</p>\n",
        "<p>existed.</p>\n<p>Two comforted children sat in the midst of delights.</p>\n<p>Sometimes Sara read aloud from her books, sometimes she learned her own</p>\n<p>lessons, sometimes she sat and looked into the fire and tried to</p>\n<p>imagine who her friend could be, and wished she could say to him some</p>\n<p>of the things in her heart.</p>\n<p>Then it came about that another wonderful thing happened.</p>\n<p>A man came to</p>\n<p>the door and left several parcels.</p>\n",
        "<p>All were addressed in large</p>\n<p>letters, \"To the Little Girl in the right-hand attic.\"</p>\n<p>Sara herself was sent to open the door and take them in.</p>\n<p>She laid the</p>\n<p>two largest parcels on the hall table, and was looking at the address,</p>\n<p>when Miss Minchin came down the stairs and saw her.</p>\n<p>\"Take the things to the young lady to whom they belong,\" she said</p>\n<p>severely.</p>\n<p>\"Don't stand there staring at them.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"They belong to me,\" answered Sara, quietly.</p>\n<p>\"To you?\" exclaimed Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know where they come from,\" said Sara, \"but they are addressed</p>\n<p>to me.</p>\n<p>I sleep in the right-hand attic.</p>\n<p>Becky has the other one.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin came to her side and looked at the parcels with an excited</p>\n<p>expression.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"What is in them?\" she demanded.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know,\" replied Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Open them,\" she ordered.</p>\n<p>Sara did as she was told.</p>\n<p>When the packages were unfolded Miss</p>\n<p>Minchin's countenance wore suddenly a singular expression.</p>\n<p>What she</p>\n<p>saw was pretty and comfortable clothing--clothing of different kinds:</p>\n<p>shoes, stockings, and gloves, and a warm and beautiful coat.</p>\n",
        "<p>There were</p>\n<p>even a nice hat and an umbrella.</p>\n<p>They were all good and expensive</p>\n<p>things, and on the pocket of the coat was pinned a paper, on which were</p>\n<p>written these words:  \"To be worn every day.</p>\n<p>Will be replaced by others</p>\n<p>when necessary.\"</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin was quite agitated.</p>\n<p>This was an incident which suggested</p>\n",
        "<p>strange things to her sordid mind.</p>\n<p>Could it be that she had made a</p>\n<p>mistake, after all, and that the neglected child had some powerful</p>\n<p>though eccentric friend in the background--perhaps some previously</p>\n<p>unknown relation, who had suddenly traced her whereabouts, and chose to</p>\n<p>provide for her in this mysterious and fantastic way?</p>\n<p>Relations were</p>\n<p>sometimes very odd--particularly rich old bachelor uncles, who did not</p>\n<p>care for having children near them.</p>\n",
        "<p>A man of that sort might prefer to</p>\n<p>overlook his young relation's welfare at a distance.</p>\n<p>Such a person,</p>\n<p>however, would be sure to be crotchety and hot-tempered enough to be</p>\n<p>easily offended.</p>\n<p>It would not be very pleasant if there were such a</p>\n<p>one, and he should learn all the truth about the thin, shabby clothes,</p>\n<p>the scant food, and the hard work.</p>\n<p>She felt very queer indeed, and</p>\n",
        "<p>very uncertain, and she gave a side glance at Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" she said, in a voice such as she had never used since the</p>\n<p>little girl lost her father, \"someone is very kind to you.</p>\n<p>As the</p>\n<p>things have been sent, and you are to have new ones when they are worn</p>\n<p>out, you may as well go and put them on and look respectable.</p>\n<p>After you</p>\n<p>are dressed you may come downstairs and learn your lessons in the</p>\n<p>schoolroom.</p>\n",
        "<p>You need not go out on any more errands today.\"</p>\n<p>About half an hour afterward, when the schoolroom door opened and Sara</p>\n<p>walked in, the entire seminary was struck dumb.</p>\n<p>\"My word!\" ejaculated Jessie, jogging Lavinia's elbow.</p>\n<p>\"Look at the</p>\n<p>Princess Sara!\"</p>\n<p>Everybody was looking, and when Lavinia looked she turned quite red.</p>\n<p>It was the Princess Sara indeed.</p>\n<p>At least, since the days when she had</p>\n",
        "<p>been a princess, Sara had never looked as she did now.</p>\n<p>She did not</p>\n<p>seem the Sara they had seen come down the back stairs a few hours ago.</p>\n<p>She was dressed in the kind of frock Lavinia had been used to envying</p>\n<p>her the possession of.</p>\n<p>It was deep and warm in color, and beautifully</p>\n<p>made.</p>\n<p>Her slender feet looked as they had done when Jessie had admired</p>\n<p>them, and the hair, whose heavy locks had made her look rather like a</p>\n",
        "<p>Shetland pony when it fell loose about her small, odd face, was tied</p>\n<p>back with a ribbon.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps someone has left her a fortune,\" Jessie whispered.</p>\n<p>\"I always</p>\n<p>thought something would happen to her.</p>\n<p>She's so queer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps the diamond mines have suddenly appeared again,\" said Lavinia,</p>\n<p>scathingly.</p>\n<p>\"Don't please her by staring at her in that way, you silly</p>\n",
        "<p>thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sara,\" broke in Miss Minchin's deep voice, \"come and sit here.\"</p>\n<p>And while the whole schoolroom stared and pushed with elbows, and</p>\n<p>scarcely made any effort to conceal its excited curiosity, Sara went to</p>\n<p>her old seat of honor, and bent her head over her books.</p>\n<p>That night, when she went to her room, after she and Becky had eaten</p>\n<p>their supper she sat and looked at the fire seriously for a long time.</p>\n<p>\"Are you making something up in your head, miss?\"  Becky inquired with</p>\n<p>respectful softness.</p>\n",
        "<p>When Sara sat in silence and looked into the</p>\n<p>coals with dreaming eyes it generally meant that she was making a new</p>\n<p>story.</p>\n<p>But this time she was not, and she shook her head.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" she answered.</p>\n<p>\"I am wondering what I ought to do.\"</p>\n<p>Becky stared--still respectfully.</p>\n<p>She was filled with something</p>\n<p>approaching reverence for everything Sara did and said.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I can't help thinking about my friend,\" Sara explained.</p>\n<p>\"If he wants</p>\n<p>to keep himself a secret, it would be rude to try and find out who he</p>\n<p>is.</p>\n<p>But I do so want him to know how thankful I am to him--and how</p>\n<p>happy he has made me.</p>\n<p>Anyone who is kind wants to know when people</p>\n<p>have been made happy.</p>\n<p>They care for that more than for being thanked.</p>\n",
        "<p>I wish--I do wish--\"</p>\n<p>She stopped short because her eyes at that instant fell upon something</p>\n<p>standing on a table in a corner.</p>\n<p>It was something she had found in the</p>\n<p>room when she came up to it only two days before.</p>\n<p>It was a little</p>\n<p>writing-case fitted with paper and envelopes and pens and ink.</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" she exclaimed, \"why did I not think of that before?\"</p>\n<p>She rose and went to the corner and brought the case back to the fire.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I can write to him,\" she said joyfully, \"and leave it on the table.</p>\n<p>Then perhaps the person who takes the things away will take it, too.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>won't ask him anything.</p>\n<p>He won't mind my thanking him, I feel sure.\"</p>\n<p>So she wrote a note.</p>\n<p>This is what she said:</p>\n<p>I hope you will not think it is impolite that I should write this note</p>\n<p>to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret.</p>\n",
        "<p>Please believe I do</p>\n<p>not mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all; only I want</p>\n<p>to thank you for being so kind to me--so heavenly kind--and making</p>\n<p>everything like a fairy story.</p>\n<p>I am so grateful to you, and I am so</p>\n<p>happy--and so is Becky.</p>\n<p>Becky feels just as thankful as I do--it is</p>\n<p>all just as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me.</p>\n<p>We used to</p>\n",
        "<p>be so lonely and cold and hungry, and now--oh, just think what you have</p>\n<p>done for us!</p>\n<p>Please let me say just these words.</p>\n<p>It seems as if I</p>\n<p>OUGHT to say them.</p>\n<p>THANK you--THANK you--THANK you!</p>\n<p>THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE ATTIC.</p>\n<p>The next morning she left this on the little table, and in the evening</p>\n<p>it had been taken away with the other things; so she knew the Magician</p>\n",
        "<p>had received it, and she was happier for the thought.</p>\n<p>She was reading</p>\n<p>one of her new books to Becky just before they went to their respective</p>\n<p>beds, when her attention was attracted by a sound at the skylight.</p>\n<p>When she looked up from her page she saw that Becky had heard the sound</p>\n<p>also, as she had turned her head to look and was listening rather</p>\n<p>nervously.</p>\n<p>\"Something's there, miss,\" she whispered.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Sara, slowly.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"It sounds--rather like a cat--trying to get</p>\n<p>in.\"</p>\n<p>She left her chair and went to the skylight.</p>\n<p>It was a queer little</p>\n<p>sound she heard--like a soft scratching.</p>\n<p>She suddenly remembered</p>\n<p>something and laughed.</p>\n<p>She remembered a quaint little intruder who had</p>\n<p>made his way into the attic once before.</p>\n",
        "<p>She had seen him that very</p>\n<p>afternoon, sitting disconsolately on a table before a window in the</p>\n<p>Indian gentleman's house.</p>\n<p>\"Suppose,\" she whispered in pleased excitement--\"just suppose it was</p>\n<p>the monkey who got away again.</p>\n<p>Oh, I wish it was!\"</p>\n<p>She climbed on a chair, very cautiously raised the skylight, and peeped</p>\n<p>out.</p>\n<p>It had been snowing all day, and on the snow, quite near her,</p>\n",
        "<p>crouched a tiny, shivering figure, whose small black face wrinkled</p>\n<p>itself piteously at sight of her.</p>\n<p>\"It is the monkey,\" she cried out.</p>\n<p>\"He has crept out of the Lascar's</p>\n<p>attic, and he saw the light.\"</p>\n<p>Becky ran to her side.</p>\n<p>\"Are you going to let him in, miss?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Sara answered joyfully.</p>\n<p>\"It's too cold for monkeys to be out.</p>\n",
        "<p>They're delicate.</p>\n<p>I'll coax him in.\"</p>\n<p>She put a hand out delicately, speaking in a coaxing voice--as she</p>\n<p>spoke to the sparrows and to Melchisedec--as if she were some friendly</p>\n<p>little animal herself.</p>\n<p>\"Come along, monkey darling,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"I won't hurt you.\"</p>\n<p>He knew she would not hurt him.</p>\n<p>He knew it before she laid her soft,</p>\n",

        "<p>I do love little animal things.\"</p>\n<p>He was evidently glad to get to the fire, and when she sat down and</p>\n<p>held him on her knee he looked from her to Becky with mingled interest</p>\n<p>and appreciation.</p>\n<p>\"He IS plain-looking, miss, ain't he?\" said Becky.</p>\n<p>\"He looks like a very ugly baby,\" laughed Sara.</p>\n<p>\"I beg your pardon,</p>\n<p>monkey; but I'm glad you are not a baby.</p>\n<p>Your mother COULDN'T be proud</p>\n",
        "<p>of you, and no one would dare to say you looked like any of your</p>\n<p>relations.</p>\n<p>Oh, I do like you!\"</p>\n<p>She leaned back in her chair and reflected.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps he's sorry he's so ugly,\" she said, \"and it's always on his</p>\n<p>mind.</p>\n<p>I wonder if he HAS a mind.</p>\n<p>Monkey, my love, have you a mind?\"</p>\n<p>But the monkey only put up a tiny paw and scratched his head.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"What shall you do with him?\"  Becky asked.</p>\n<p>\"I shall let him sleep with me tonight, and then take him back to the</p>\n<p>Indian gentleman tomorrow.</p>\n<p>I am sorry to take you back, monkey; but</p>\n<p>you must go.</p>\n<p>You ought to be fondest of your own family; and I'm not a</p>\n<p>REAL relation.\"</p>\n<p>And when she went to bed she made him a nest at her feet, and he curled</p>\n<p>up and slept there as if he were a baby and much pleased with his</p>\n",

        "<p>When he felt at last sure that he had found them and had gone to</p>\n<p>their house, he had been told that they were absent on a journey.</p>\n<p>His</p>\n<p>efforts to reach them had been unavailing, so he had decided to remain</p>\n<p>in Moscow until their return.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford sat in his reclining</p>\n<p>chair, and Janet sat on the floor beside him.</p>\n<p>He was very fond of</p>\n",
        "<p>Janet.</p>\n<p>Nora had found a footstool, and Donald was astride the tiger's</p>\n<p>head which ornamented the rug made of the animal's skin.</p>\n<p>It must be</p>\n<p>owned that he was riding it rather violently.</p>\n<p>\"Don't chirrup so loud, Donald,\" Janet said.</p>\n<p>\"When you come to cheer</p>\n<p>an ill person up you don't cheer him up at the top of your voice.</p>\n<p>Perhaps cheering up is too loud, Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Carrisford?\" turning to the Indian</p>\n<p>gentleman.</p>\n<p>But he only patted her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"No, it isn't,\" he answered.</p>\n<p>\"And it keeps me from thinking too much.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to be quiet,\" Donald shouted.</p>\n<p>\"We'll all be as quiet as</p>\n<p>mice.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mice don't make a noise like that,\" said Janet.</p>\n",
        "<p>Donald made a bridle of his handkerchief and bounced up and down on the</p>\n<p>tiger's head.</p>\n<p>\"A whole lot of mice might,\" he said cheerfully.</p>\n<p>\"A thousand mice</p>\n<p>might.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't believe fifty thousand mice would,\" said Janet, severely; \"and</p>\n<p>we have to be as quiet as one mouse.\"</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford laughed and patted her shoulder again.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Papa won't be very long now,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"May we talk about the lost</p>\n<p>little girl?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't think I could talk much about anything else just now,\" the</p>\n<p>Indian gentleman answered, knitting his forehead with a tired look.</p>\n<p>\"We like her so much,\" said Nora.</p>\n<p>\"We call her the little un-fairy</p>\n<p>princess.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" the Indian gentleman inquired, because the fancies of the Large</p>\n",
        "<p>Family always made him forget things a little.</p>\n<p>It was Janet who answered.</p>\n<p>\"It is because, though she is not exactly a fairy, she will be so rich</p>\n<p>when she is found that she will be like a princess in a fairy tale.</p>\n<p>We</p>\n<p>called her the fairy princess at first, but it didn't quite suit.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is it true,\" said Nora, \"that her papa gave all his money to a friend</p>\n<p>to put in a mine that had diamonds in it, and then the friend thought</p>\n<p>he had lost it all and ran away because he felt as if he was a robber?\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"But he wasn't really, you know,\" put in Janet, hastily.</p>\n<p>The Indian gentleman took hold of her hand quickly.</p>\n<p>\"No, he wasn't really,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I am sorry for the friend,\" Janet said; \"I can't help it.</p>\n<p>He didn't</p>\n<p>mean to do it, and it would break his heart.</p>\n<p>I am sure it would break</p>\n<p>his heart.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are an understanding little woman, Janet,\" the Indian gentleman</p>\n",
        "<p>said, and he held her hand close.</p>\n<p>\"Did you tell Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford,\" Donald shouted again, \"about the</p>\n<p>little-girl-who-isn't-a-beggar?</p>\n<p>Did you tell him she has new nice</p>\n<p>clothes?</p>\n<p>P'r'aps she's been found by somebody when she was lost.\"</p>\n<p>\"There's a cab!\" exclaimed Janet.</p>\n<p>\"It's stopping before the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>It</p>\n<p>is papa!\"</p>\n<p>They all ran to the windows to look out.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, it's papa,\" Donald proclaimed.</p>\n<p>\"But there is no little girl.\"</p>\n<p>All three of them incontinently fled from the room and tumbled into the</p>\n<p>hall.</p>\n<p>It was in this way they always welcomed their father.</p>\n<p>They were</p>\n",
        "<p>to be heard jumping up and down, clapping their hands, and being caught</p>\n<p>up and kissed.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford made an effort to rise and sank back again.</p>\n<p>\"It is no use,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"What a wreck I am!\"</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael's voice approached the door.</p>\n<p>\"No, children,\" he was saying; \"you may come in after I have talked to</p>\n",
        "<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford.</p>\n<p>Go and play with Ram Dass.\"</p>\n<p>Then the door opened and he came in.</p>\n<p>He looked rosier than ever, and</p>\n<p>brought an atmosphere of freshness and health with him; but his eyes</p>\n<p>were disappointed and anxious as they met the invalid's look of eager</p>\n<p>question even as they grasped each other's hands.</p>\n<p>\"What news?\"  Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Carrisford asked.</p>\n<p>\"The child the Russian people</p>\n<p>adopted?\"</p>\n<p>\"She is not the child we are looking for,\" was Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael's answer.</p>\n<p>\"She is much younger than Captain Crewe's little girl.</p>\n<p>Her name is</p>\n<p>Emily Carew.</p>\n<p>I have seen and talked to her.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Russians were able to</p>\n<p>give me every detail.\"</p>\n<p>How wearied and miserable the Indian gentleman looked!</p>\n<p>His hand</p>\n<p>dropped from Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael's.</p>\n<p>\"Then the search has to be begun over again,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"That is all.</p>\n<p>Please sit down.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael took a seat.</p>\n<p>Somehow, he had gradually grown fond of</p>\n<p>this unhappy man.</p>\n<p>He was himself so well and happy, and so surrounded</p>\n<p>by cheerfulness and love, that desolation and broken health seemed</p>\n<p>pitifully unbearable things.</p>\n<p>If there had been the sound of just one</p>\n<p>gay little high-pitched voice in the house, it would have been so much</p>\n",
        "<p>less forlorn.</p>\n<p>And that a man should be compelled to carry about in his</p>\n<p>breast the thought that he had seemed to wrong and desert a child was</p>\n<p>not a thing one could face.</p>\n<p>\"Come, come,\" he said in his cheery voice; \"we'll find her yet.\"</p>\n<p>\"We must begin at once.</p>\n<p>No time must be lost,\" Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford fretted.</p>\n<p>\"Have you any new suggestion to make--any whatsoever?\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael felt rather restless, and he rose and began to pace the</p>\n<p>room with a thoughtful, though uncertain face.</p>\n<p>\"Well, perhaps,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what it may be worth.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>fact is, an idea occurred to me as I was thinking the thing over in the</p>\n<p>train on the journey from Dover.\"</p>\n<p>\"What was it?</p>\n",
        "<p>If she is alive, she is somewhere.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes; she is SOMEWHERE.</p>\n<p>We have searched the schools in Paris.</p>\n<p>Let us</p>\n<p>give up Paris and begin in London.</p>\n<p>That was my idea--to search London.\"</p>\n<p>\"There are schools enough in London,\" said Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford.</p>\n<p>Then he</p>\n",
        "<p>slightly started, roused by a recollection.</p>\n<p>\"By the way, there is one</p>\n<p>next door.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then we will begin there.</p>\n<p>We cannot begin nearer than next door.\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Carrisford.</p>\n<p>\"There is a child there who interests me; but</p>\n<p>she is not a pupil.</p>\n<p>And she is a little dark, forlorn creature, as</p>\n",
        "<p>unlike poor Crewe as a child could be.\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Magic was at work again at that very moment--the beautiful</p>\n<p>Magic.</p>\n<p>It really seemed as if it might be so.</p>\n<p>What was it that brought</p>\n<p>Ram Dass into the room--even as his master spoke--salaaming</p>\n<p>respectfully, but with a scarcely concealed touch of excitement in his</p>\n<p>dark, flashing eyes?</p>\n<p>\"Sahib,\" he said, \"the child herself has come--the child the sahib felt</p>\n",
        "<p>pity for.</p>\n<p>She brings back the monkey who had again run away to her</p>\n<p>attic under the roof.</p>\n<p>I have asked that she remain.</p>\n<p>It was my thought</p>\n<p>that it would please the sahib to see and speak with her.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who is she?\" inquired Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael.</p>\n<p>\"God knows,\" Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Carrrisford answered.</p>\n<p>\"She is the child I spoke of.</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>little drudge at the school.\"  He waved his hand to Ram Dass, and</p>\n<p>addressed him.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I should like to see her.</p>\n<p>Go and bring her in.\"</p>\n<p>Then he turned to Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"While you have been away,\" he</p>\n<p>explained, \"I have been desperate.</p>\n<p>The days were so dark and long.</p>\n<p>Ram</p>\n<p>Dass told me of this child's miseries, and together we invented a</p>\n<p>romantic plan to help her.</p>\n<p>I suppose it was a childish thing to do;</p>\n<p>but it gave me something to plan and think of.</p>\n<p>Without the help of an</p>\n",
        "<p>agile, soft-footed Oriental like Ram Dass, however, it could not have</p>\n<p>been done.\"</p>\n<p>Then Sara came into the room.</p>\n<p>She carried the monkey in her arms, and</p>\n<p>he evidently did not intend to part from her, if it could be helped.</p>\n<p>He was clinging to her and chattering, and the interesting excitement</p>\n<p>of finding herself in the Indian gentleman's room had brought a flush</p>\n<p>to Sara's cheeks.</p>\n<p>\"Your monkey ran away again,\" she said, in her pretty voice.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"He came</p>\n<p>to my garret window last night, and I took him in because it was so</p>\n<p>cold.</p>\n<p>I would have brought him back if it had not been so late.</p>\n<p>I knew</p>\n<p>you were ill and might not like to be disturbed.\"</p>\n<p>The Indian gentleman's hollow eyes dwelt on her with curious interest.</p>\n<p>\"That was very thoughtful of you,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Sara looked toward Ram Dass, who stood near the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Shall I give him to the Lascar?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"How do you know he is a Lascar?\" said the Indian gentleman, smiling a</p>\n<p>little.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I know Lascars,\" Sara said, handing over the reluctant monkey.</p>\n<p>\"I</p>\n<p>was born in India.\"</p>\n<p>The Indian gentleman sat upright so suddenly, and with such a change of</p>\n<p>expression, that she was for a moment quite startled.</p>\n<p>\"You were born in India,\" he exclaimed, \"were you?</p>\n",
        "<p>Come here.\" And he</p>\n<p>held out his hand.</p>\n<p>Sara went to him and laid her hand in his, as he seemed to want to take</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>She stood still, and her green-gray eyes met his wonderingly.</p>\n<p>Something seemed to be the matter with him.</p>\n<p>\"You live next door?\" he demanded.</p>\n<p>\"Yes; I live at Miss Minchin's seminary.\"</p>\n<p>\"But you are not one of her pupils?\"</p>\n",
        "<p>A strange little smile hovered about Sara's mouth.</p>\n<p>She hesitated a</p>\n<p>moment.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think I know exactly WHAT I am,\" she replied.</p>\n<p>\"Why not?\"</p>\n<p>\"At first I was a pupil, and a parlor boarder; but now--\"</p>\n<p>\"You were a pupil!</p>\n<p>What are you now?\"</p>\n<p>The queer little sad smile was on Sara's lips again.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I sleep in the attic, next to the scullery maid,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"I run</p>\n<p>errands for the cook--I do anything she tells me; and I teach the</p>\n<p>little ones their lessons.\"</p>\n<p>\"Question her, Carmichael,\" said Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford, sinking back as if he</p>\n<p>had lost his strength.</p>\n<p>\"Question her; I cannot.\"</p>\n<p>The big, kind father of the Large Family knew how to question little</p>\n",
        "<p>girls.</p>\n<p>Sara realized how much practice he had had when he spoke to her</p>\n<p>in his nice, encouraging voice.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean by 'At first,' my child?\" he inquired.</p>\n<p>\"When I was first taken there by my papa.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where is your papa?\"</p>\n<p>\"He died,\" said Sara, very quietly.</p>\n<p>\"He lost all his money and there</p>\n<p>was none left for me.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was no one to take care of me or to pay</p>\n<p>Miss Minchin.\"</p>\n<p>\"Carmichael!\" the Indian gentleman cried out loudly.</p>\n<p>\"Carmichael!\"</p>\n<p>\"We must not frighten her,\" Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael said aside to him in a</p>\n<p>quick, low voice.</p>\n<p>And he added aloud to Sara, \"So you were sent up</p>\n<p>into the attic, and made into a little drudge.</p>\n",
        "<p>That was about it,</p>\n<p>wasn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"There was no one to take care of me,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"There was no money;</p>\n<p>I belong to nobody.\"</p>\n<p>\"How did your father lose his money?\" the Indian gentleman broke in</p>\n<p>breathlessly.</p>\n<p>\"He did not lose it himself,\" Sara answered, wondering still more each</p>\n<p>moment.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"He had a friend he was very fond of--he was very fond of him.</p>\n<p>It was his friend who took his money.</p>\n<p>He trusted his friend too much.\"</p>\n<p>The Indian gentleman's breath came more quickly.</p>\n<p>\"The friend might have MEANT to do no harm,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"It might have</p>\n<p>happened through a mistake.\"</p>\n<p>Sara did not know how unrelenting her quiet young voice sounded as she</p>\n<p>answered.</p>\n",
        "<p>If she had known, she would surely have tried to soften it</p>\n<p>for the Indian gentleman's sake.</p>\n<p>\"The suffering was just as bad for my papa,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"It killed him.\"</p>\n<p>\"What was your father's name?\" the Indian gentleman said.</p>\n<p>\"Tell me.\"</p>\n<p>\"His name was Ralph Crewe,\" Sara answered, feeling startled.</p>\n<p>\"Captain</p>\n<p>Crewe.</p>\n",
        "<p>He died in India.\"</p>\n<p>The haggard face contracted, and Ram Dass sprang to his master's side.</p>\n<p>\"Carmichael,\" the invalid gasped, \"it is the child--the child!\"</p>\n<p>For a moment Sara thought he was going to die.</p>\n<p>Ram Dass poured out</p>\n<p>drops from a bottle, and held them to his lips.</p>\n<p>Sara stood near,</p>\n<p>trembling a little.</p>\n<p>She looked in a bewildered way at Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Carmichael.</p>\n<p>\"What child am I?\" she faltered.</p>\n<p>\"He was your father's friend,\" Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael answered her.</p>\n<p>\"Don't be</p>\n<p>frightened.</p>\n<p>We have been looking for you for two years.\"</p>\n<p>Sara put her hand up to her forehead, and her mouth trembled.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",
        "<p>spoke as if she were in a dream.</p>\n<p>\"And I was at Miss Minchin's all the while,\" she half whispered.</p>\n<p>\"Just</p>\n<p>on the other side of the wall.\"</p>\n<p>18</p>\n<p>\"I Tried Not to Be\"</p>\n<p>It was pretty, comfortable Mrs.</p>\n<p>Carmichael who explained everything.</p>\n<p>She was sent for at once, and came across the square to take Sara into</p>\n",
        "<p>her warm arms and make clear to her all that had happened.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>excitement of the totally unexpected discovery had been temporarily</p>\n<p>almost overpowering to Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford in his weak condition.</p>\n<p>\"Upon my word,\" he said faintly to Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael, when it was</p>\n<p>suggested that the little girl should go into another room.</p>\n<p>\"I feel as</p>\n",
        "<p>if I do not want to lose sight of her.\"</p>\n<p>\"I will take care of her,\" Janet said, \"and mamma will come in a few</p>\n<p>minutes.\"  And it was Janet who led her away.</p>\n<p>\"We're so glad you are found,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"You don't know how glad we</p>\n<p>are that you are found.\"</p>\n<p>Donald stood with his hands in his pockets, and gazed at Sara with</p>\n<p>reflecting and self-reproachful eyes.</p>\n<p>\"If I'd just asked what your name was when I gave you my sixpence,\" he</p>\n",
        "<p>said, \"you would have told me it was Sara Crewe, and then you would</p>\n<p>have been found in a minute.\"  Then Mrs.</p>\n<p>Carmichael came in.</p>\n<p>She looked</p>\n<p>very much moved, and suddenly took Sara in her arms and kissed her.</p>\n<p>\"You look bewildered, poor child,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"And it is not to be</p>\n<p>wondered at.\"</p>\n<p>Sara could only think of one thing.</p>\n",

        "<p>\"He did not really lose</p>\n<p>your papa's money.</p>\n<p>He only thought he had lost it; and because he</p>\n<p>loved him so much his grief made him so ill that for a time he was not</p>\n<p>in his right mind.</p>\n<p>He almost died of brain fever, and long before he</p>\n<p>began to recover your poor papa was dead.\"</p>\n<p>\"And he did not know where to find me,\" murmured Sara.</p>\n<p>\"And I was so</p>\n",
        "<p>near.\"  Somehow, she could not forget that she had been so near.</p>\n<p>\"He believed you were in school in France,\" Mrs.</p>\n<p>Carmichael explained.</p>\n<p>\"And he was continually misled by false clues.</p>\n<p>He has looked for you</p>\n<p>everywhere.</p>\n<p>When he saw you pass by, looking so sad and neglected, he</p>\n<p>did not dream that you were his friend's poor child; but because you</p>\n<p>were a little girl, too, he was sorry for you, and wanted to make you</p>\n",
        "<p>happier.</p>\n<p>And he told Ram Dass to climb into your attic window and try</p>\n<p>to make you comfortable.\"</p>\n<p>Sara gave a start of joy; her whole look changed.</p>\n<p>\"Did Ram Dass bring the things?\" she cried out.</p>\n<p>\"Did he tell Ram Dass</p>\n<p>to do it?</p>\n<p>Did he make the dream that came true?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, my dear--yes!</p>\n",
        "<p>He is kind and good, and he was sorry for you, for</p>\n<p>little lost Sara Crewe's sake.\"</p>\n<p>The library door opened and Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael appeared, calling Sara to</p>\n<p>him with a gesture.</p>\n<p>\"Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford is better already,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"He wants you to come to</p>\n<p>him.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>Sara did not wait.</p>\n<p>When the Indian gentleman looked at her as she</p>\n<p>entered, he saw that her face was all alight.</p>\n<p>She went and stood before his chair, with her hands clasped together</p>\n<p>against her breast.</p>\n<p>\"You sent the things to me,\" she said, in a joyful emotional little</p>\n<p>voice, \"the beautiful, beautiful things?</p>\n<p>YOU sent them!\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, poor, dear child, I did,\" he answered her.</p>\n",
        "<p>He was weak and</p>\n<p>broken with long illness and trouble, but he looked at her with the</p>\n<p>look she remembered in her father's eyes--that look of loving her and</p>\n<p>wanting to take her in his arms.</p>\n<p>It made her kneel down by him, just</p>\n<p>as she used to kneel by her father when they were the dearest friends</p>\n<p>and lovers in the world.</p>\n<p>\"Then it is you who are my friend,\" she said; \"it is you who are my</p>\n<p>friend!\"  And she dropped her face on his thin hand and kissed it again</p>\n",
        "<p>and again.</p>\n<p>\"The man will be himself again in three weeks,\" Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael said</p>\n<p>aside to his wife.</p>\n<p>\"Look at his face already.\"</p>\n<p>In fact, he did look changed.</p>\n<p>Here was the \"Little Missus,\" and he had</p>\n<p>new things to think of and plan for already.</p>\n<p>In the first place, there</p>\n",
        "<p>was Miss Minchin.</p>\n<p>She must be interviewed and told of the change which</p>\n<p>had taken place in the fortunes of her pupil.</p>\n<p>Sara was not to return to the seminary at all.</p>\n<p>The Indian gentleman</p>\n<p>was very determined upon that point.</p>\n<p>She must remain where she was,</p>\n<p>and Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael should go and see Miss Minchin himself.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I am glad I need not go back,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"She will be very angry.</p>\n<p>She does not like me; though perhaps it is my fault, because I do not</p>\n<p>like her.\"</p>\n<p>But, oddly enough, Miss Minchin made it unnecessary for Mr.</p>\n<p>Carmichael</p>\n<p>to go to her, by actually coming in search of her pupil herself.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>had wanted Sara for something, and on inquiry had heard an astonishing</p>\n",
        "<p>thing.</p>\n<p>One of the housemaids had seen her steal out of the area with</p>\n<p>something hidden under her cloak, and had also seen her go up the steps</p>\n<p>of the next door and enter the house.</p>\n<p>\"What does she mean!\" cried Miss Minchin to Miss Amelia.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know, I'm sure, sister,\" answered Miss Amelia.</p>\n<p>\"Unless she</p>\n<p>has made friends with him because he has lived in India.\"</p>\n<p>\"It would be just like her to thrust herself upon him and try to gain</p>\n",

        "<p>excitement, it was combined with such amazement as seemed to belong to</p>\n<p>a kind of shock just received.</p>\n<p>\"What IS the matter?\" cried two or three voices at once.</p>\n<p>\"Is it anything to do with the row that has been going on?\" said</p>\n<p>Lavinia, eagerly.</p>\n<p>\"There has been such a row in Miss Minchin's room,</p>\n<p>Miss Amelia has had something like hysterics and has had to go to bed.\"</p>\n<p>Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half stunned.</p>\n<p>\"I have just had this letter from Sara,\" she said, holding it out to</p>\n",

        "<p>There was nothing the Indian gentleman loved more than the recollection</p>\n<p>of the little princess in rags and tatters.</p>\n<p>The afternoons in which</p>\n<p>the Large Family, or Ermengarde and Lottie, gathered to rejoice</p>\n<p>together were very delightful.</p>\n<p>But the hours when Sara and the Indian</p>\n<p>gentleman sat alone and read or talked had a special charm of their</p>\n<p>own.</p>\n<p>During their passing many interesting things occurred.</p>\n",
        "<p>One evening, Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford, looking up from his book, noticed that his</p>\n<p>companion had not stirred for some time, but sat gazing into the fire.</p>\n<p>\"What are you 'supposing,' Sara?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>Sara looked up, with a bright color on her cheek.</p>\n<p>\"I WAS supposing,\" she said; \"I was remembering that hungry day, and a</p>\n<p>child I saw.\"</p>\n<p>\"But there were a great many hungry days,\" said the Indian gentleman,</p>\n<p>with rather a sad tone in his voice.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Which hungry day was it?\"</p>\n<p>\"I forgot you didn't know,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"It was the day the dream came</p>\n<p>true.\"</p>\n<p>Then she told him the story of the bun shop, and the fourpence she</p>\n<p>picked up out of the sloppy mud, and the child who was hungrier than</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n<p>She told it quite simply, and in as few words as possible;</p>\n<p>but somehow the Indian gentleman found it necessary to shade his eyes</p>\n",
        "<p>with his hand and look down at the carpet.</p>\n<p>\"And I was supposing a kind of plan,\" she said, when she had finished.</p>\n<p>\"I was thinking I should like to do something.\"</p>\n<p>\"What was it?\" said Mr.</p>\n<p>Carrisford, in a low tone.</p>\n<p>\"You may do</p>\n<p>anything you like to do, princess.\"</p>\n<p>\"I was wondering,\" rather hesitated Sara--\"you know, you say I have so</p>\n<p>much money--I was wondering if I could go to see the bun-woman, and</p>\n",
        "<p>tell her that if, when hungry children--particularly on those dreadful</p>\n<p>days--come and sit on the steps, or look in at the window, she would</p>\n<p>just call them in and give them something to eat, she might send the</p>\n<p>bills to me.</p>\n<p>Could I do that?\"</p>\n<p>\"You shall do it tomorrow morning,\" said the Indian gentleman.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"You see, I know what it is to be hungry, and</p>\n<p>it is very hard when one cannot even PRETEND it away.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Yes, yes, my dear,\" said the Indian gentleman.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes, it must be.</p>\n<p>Try to forget it.</p>\n<p>Come and sit on this footstool near my knee, and</p>\n<p>only remember you are a princess.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Sara, smiling; \"and I can give buns and bread to the</p>\n<p>populace.\"  And she went and sat on the stool, and the Indian gentleman</p>\n<p>(he used to like her to call him that, too, sometimes) drew her small</p>\n<p>dark head down on his knee and stroked her hair.</p>\n",
        "<p>The next morning, Miss Minchin, in looking out of her window, saw the</p>\n<p>things she perhaps least enjoyed seeing.</p>\n<p>The Indian gentleman's</p>\n<p>carriage, with its tall horses, drew up before the door of the next</p>\n<p>house, and its owner and a little figure, warm with soft, rich furs,</p>\n<p>descended the steps to get into it.</p>\n<p>The little figure was a familiar</p>\n<p>one, and reminded Miss Minchin of days in the past.</p>\n<p>It was followed by</p>\n",
        "<p>another as familiar--the sight of which she found very irritating.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>was Becky, who, in the character of delighted attendant, always</p>\n<p>accompanied her young mistress to her carriage, carrying wraps and</p>\n<p>belongings.</p>\n<p>Already Becky had a pink, round face.</p>\n<p>A little later the carriage drew up before the door of the baker's</p>\n<p>shop, and its occupants got out, oddly enough, just as the bun-woman</p>\n<p>was putting a tray of smoking-hot buns into the window.</p>\n",
        "<p>When Sara entered the shop the woman turned and looked at her, and,</p>\n<p>leaving the buns, came and stood behind the counter.</p>\n<p>For a moment she</p>\n<p>looked at Sara very hard indeed, and then her good-natured face lighted</p>\n<p>up.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure that I remember you, miss,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"And yet--\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Sara; \"once you gave me six buns for fourpence, and--\"</p>\n<p>\"And you gave five of 'em to a beggar child,\" the woman broke in on</p>\n",
        "<p>her.</p>\n<p>\"I've always remembered it.</p>\n<p>I couldn't make it out at first.\" She</p>\n<p>turned round to the Indian gentleman and spoke her next words to him.</p>\n<p>\"I beg your pardon, sir, but there's not many young people that notices</p>\n<p>a hungry face in that way; and I've thought of it many a time.</p>\n<p>Excuse</p>\n<p>the liberty, miss,\"--to Sara--\"but you look rosier and--well, better</p>\n<p>than you did that--that--\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I am better, thank you,\" said Sara.</p>\n<p>\"And--I am much happier--and I</p>\n<p>have come to ask you to do something for me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Me, miss!\" exclaimed the bun-woman, smiling cheerfully.</p>\n<p>\"Why, bless</p>\n<p>you!</p>\n<p>Yes, miss.</p>\n<p>What can I do?\"</p>\n<p>And then Sara, leaning on the counter, made her little proposal</p>\n",
        "<p>concerning the dreadful days and the hungry waifs and the buns.</p>\n<p>The woman watched her, and listened with an astonished face.</p>\n<p>\"Why, bless me!\" she said again when she had heard it all; \"it'll be a</p>\n<p>pleasure to me to do it.</p>\n<p>I am a working-woman myself and cannot afford</p>\n<p>to do much on my own account, and there's sights of trouble on every</p>\n<p>side; but, if you'll excuse me, I'm bound to say I've given away many a</p>\n<p>bit of bread since that wet afternoon, just along o' thinking of</p>\n<p>you--an' how wet an' cold you was, an' how hungry you looked; an' yet</p>\n",
        "<p>you gave away your hot buns as if you was a princess.\"</p>\n<p>The Indian gentleman smiled involuntarily at this, and Sara smiled a</p>\n<p>little, too, remembering what she had said to herself when she put the</p>\n<p>buns down on the ravenous child's ragged lap.</p>\n<p>\"She looked so hungry,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"She was even hungrier than I was.\"</p>\n<p>\"She was starving,\" said the woman.</p>\n<p>\"Many's the time she's told me of</p>\n<p>it since--how she sat there in the wet, and felt as if a wolf was</p>\n",
        "<p>a-tearing at her poor young insides.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, have you seen her since then?\" exclaimed Sara.</p>\n<p>\"Do you know where</p>\n<p>she is?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I do,\" answered the woman, smiling more good-naturedly than ever.</p>\n<p>\"Why, she's in that there back room, miss, an' has been for a month;</p>\n<p>an' a decent, well-meanin' girl she's goin' to turn out, an' such a</p>\n<p>help to me in the shop an' in the kitchen as you'd scarce believe,</p>\n<p>knowin' how she's lived.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>She stepped to the door of the little back parlor and spoke; and the</p>\n<p>next minute a girl came out and followed her behind the counter.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>actually it was the beggar-child, clean and neatly clothed, and looking</p>\n<p>as if she had not been hungry for a long time.</p>\n<p>She looked shy, but she</p>\n<p>had a nice face, now that she was no longer a savage, and the wild look</p>\n<p>had gone from her eyes.</p>\n<p>She knew Sara in an instant, and stood and</p>\n",
        "<p>looked at her as if she could never look enough.</p>\n<p>\"You see,\" said the woman, \"I told her to come when she was hungry, and</p>\n<p>when she'd come I'd give her odd jobs to do; an' I found she was</p>\n<p>willing, and somehow I got to like her; and the end of it was, I've</p>\n<p>given her a place an' a home, and she helps me, an' behaves well, an'</p>\n<p>is as thankful as a girl can be.</p>\n<p>Her name's Anne.</p>\n<p>She has no other.\"</p>\n<p>The children stood and looked at each other for a few minutes; and then</p>\n",
        "<p>Sara took her hand out of her muff and held it out across the counter,</p>\n<p>and Anne took it, and they looked straight into each other's eyes.</p>\n<p>\"I am so glad,\" Sara said.</p>\n<p>\"And I have just thought of something.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Mrs.</p>\n<p>Brown will let you be the one to give the buns and bread</p>\n<p>to the children.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you would like to do it because you know what</p>\n<p>it is to be hungry, too.\"</p>\n",
        "<p>\"Yes, miss,\" said the girl.</p>\n<p>And, somehow, Sara felt as if she understood her, though she said so</p>\n<p>little, and only stood still and looked and looked after her as she</p>\n<p>went out of the shop with the Indian gentleman, and they got into the</p>\n<p>carriage and drove away.</p>\n<p>End of Project Gutenberg's A Little Princess, by Frances Hodgson Burnett</p>\n"
