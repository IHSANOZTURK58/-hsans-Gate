            `<h3>Chapter 1: A Sunny Morning</h3>
            <p>It is a beautiful Saturday morning. The sun is shining in the blue sky. Birds are singing in the trees. Tom wakes up early. He is seven years old.</p>
            <p>Tom jumps out of bed. He is very happy. Today is a special day. He does not have school. He can play outside all day.</p>
            <p>He goes to the kitchen. His mother is cooking breakfast. "Good morning, Tom," she says. "Good morning, Mom," says Tom. He eats his eggs and toast quickly.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: Playing in the Park</h3>
            <p>After breakfast, Tom runs to the park. The park is near his house. It is big and green. There are many trees and flowers.</p>
            <p>Tom sees his friends, Ben and Lisa. They are playing with a ball. "Hello!" shouts Tom. "Can I play too?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, come on!" says Ben. They kick the ball. They run and laugh. It is a lot of fun. They play for a long time.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Strange Noise</h3>
            <p>Suddenly, Tom hears a noise. It sounds like a cry. "Listen," says Tom. "What is that?" The children stop playing.</p>
            <p>"I don't hear anything," says Lisa. "Listen again," says Tom. They are very quiet. Then they hear it. *Whimper, whimper.*</p>
            <p>"It is coming from the bushes," says Ben. They walk slowly to the green bushes. They are a little afraid.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: Finding the Puppy</h3>
            <p>Tom looks behind the bushes. He sees something small. It is brown and white. It has big eyes and floppy ears.</p>
            <p>"Look!" says Tom. "It is a puppy!" The puppy is very small. It looks sad and scared. It is shaking.</p>
            <p>"Oh, poor puppy," says Lisa. She speaks softly. "Where is your mother?" The puppy looks at them. It wags its tail slightly.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: No Collar</h3>
            <p>Tom touches the puppy gently. The puppy's fur is soft but dirty. It looks hungry. Tom looks at the puppy's neck.</p>
            <p>"He does not have a collar," says Tom. "He does not have a name tag." Use usually, dogs have collars with their names.</p>
            <p>"Is he lost?" asks Ben. "I think so," says Tom. "He is all alone." The children look around the park. They do not see any adult looking for a dog.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: Hungry and Thirsty</h3>
            <p>The puppy licks Tom's hand. It is a friendly puppy. "He is hungry," says Lisa. "And thirsty too."</p>
            <p>"I have a water bottle," says Ben. He pours some water into his hand. The puppy drinks the water fast. *Slurp, slurp, slurp.*</p>
            <p>"We need to give him food," says Tom. "But we don't have any dog food." They worry about the little dog.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: Taking Him Home</h3>
            <p>"We cannot leave him here," says Tom. "He is too small." Tom picks up the puppy. It is warm and heavy.</p>
            <p>"Where are you going?" asks Lisa. "I am taking him home," says Tom. "Maybe my mom can help us."</p>
            <p>Ben and Lisa walk with Tom. They leave the park. They walk down the street to Tom's house.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: Mom's Surprise</h3>
            <p>They arrive at Tom's house. Tom opens the door. "Mom! Look what we found!" he calls.</p>
            <p>His mother comes from the living room. She sees the dirty puppy in Tom's arms. Her eyes get big. "Oh my goodness! A dog!"</p>
            <p>"We found him in the park," explains Tom. "He was alone. He doesn't have a collar. Can we give him some food?"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 9: Feeding the Puppy</h3>
            <p>Mom smiles. She likes animals. "Okay," she says. "But first, we must maintain safety. Wash your hands."</p>
            <p>She gives them a bowl of milk and some bread. The puppy eats very fast. He is very hungry. His tail wags faster now.</p>
            <p>"He likes it!" says Ben. The puppy finishes the food. He licks the bowl clean. He looks happy.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 10: Cleaning Up</h3>
            <p>"He is very dirty," says Mom. "He needs a bath." Tom and his friends help. They get a tub of warm water.</p>
            <p>They use dog shampoo. They wash the puppy. There are bubbles everywhere. The puppy splashes water. The children get wet too.</p>
            <p>They laugh. "Now he is clean," says Lisa. They dry him with a soft towel. His fur is white and brown and fluffy.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 11: Searching for the Owner</h3>
            <p>"Now we must find his owner," says Mom. "Someone is missing this sweet puppy." Tom feels sad. He wants to keep the puppy.</p>
            <p>"But what if he doesn't have an owner?" asks Tom. "Every dog belongs to someone," says Mom. "We must try to find them."</p>
            <p>Mom takes a picture of the puppy. She prints "FOUND DOG" posters on her computer. The children help.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 12: Making Posters</h3>
            <p>The posters say: "FOUND PUPPY. Brown and white. Very friendly. Found in City Park. Call this number."</p>
            <p>Tom, Ben, and Lisa take the posters. They go back to the park. They tape the posters on trees and lamp posts.</p>
            <p>"I hope his owner sees this," says Lisa. "I hope so too," says Tom quietly.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 13: Waiting</h3>
            <p>They go back to Tom's house. They wait for the phone to ring. The puppy plays with a ball. He runs around the room.</p>
            <p>One hour passes. Two hours pass. The phone does not ring. Tom starts to hope. "Maybe nobody calls," he thinks.</p>
            <p>"If nobody calls, can I keep him?" asks Tom. "We will see," says Mom. "Taking care of a dog is big work."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 14: A Name for the Puppy</h3>
            <p>"We need to call him something," says Ben. "We cannot say 'Puppy' all the time." They think of names.</p>
            <p>"Spot?" suggests Lisa. "No," says Tom. "Rover?" suggests Ben. "No," says Tom.</p>
            <p>The puppy jumps on the sofa. He looks like a ball of cotton. "Cotton!" says Tom. "His name is Cotton." The puppy barks. "Woof!"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 15: The Phone Rings</h3>
            <p>It is evening. The sun goes down. Suddenly, the phone rings! *Ring, ring!* Everyone jumps.</p>
            <p>Mom answers the phone. "Hello? Yes? Yes, we found a puppy." Tom's heart beats fast. He holds Cotton tight.</p>
            <p>Mom talks for a minute. Then she hangs up. She looks at the children. "It was a lady," she says.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 16: The Sad Truth</h3>
            <p>"Is she the owner?" asks Tom. "Yes," says Mom. "Her name is Mrs. Miller. She lives near the park. She was very sad."</p>
            <p>"She lost her puppy this morning. She was looking for him everywhere. She saw our poster."</p>
            <p>Tom is sad. "So she is coming?" he asks. "Yes, she is coming now," says Mom. Tom kisses Cotton's head.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 17: Mrs. Miller Arrives</h3>
            <p>A car stops outside. A woman comes to the door. She looks kind but tired. Mom opens the door.</p>
            <p>"Cotton! Oh, Buster!" crowds the woman. "Buster?" asks Tom. "Yes, his name is Buster," she says.</p>
            <p>The puppy sees the woman. He runs to her. He wags his tail very fast. He is very happy to see her.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 18: Saying Goodbye</h3>
            <p>Mrs. Miller picks up the puppy. She cries happy tears. "Thank you," she says to the children. "Thank you for saving him."</p>
            <p>She looks at Tom. She sees he is sad. "You took good care of him," she says. "You are a good boy."</p>
            <p>"Goodbye, Cotton," whispers Tom. "Be a good boy." The puppy licks Tom's face one last time.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 19: A Reward</h3>
            <p>Mrs. Miller gives Mom a box of chocolates. "For the children," she says. Then she takes the puppy to the car.</p>
            <p>They drive away. The house is quiet. Tom misses the puppy. "I am sorry, Tom," says Ben.</p>
            <p>"It's okay," says Tom. "He is with his family. That is the most important thing." He tries to smile.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 20: A Happy Ending</h3>
            <p>The next day, the doorbell rings. It is Mrs. Miller again. But she does not have the puppy.</p>
            <p>She has a basket. In the basket, there is another puppy! "Buster's sister needed a home," she says.</p>
            <p>"Would you like to keep her?" asks Mrs. Miller. Tom looks at Mom. Mom smiles. "Yes!" shouts Tom. "Yes!" He holds the new puppy. He is the happiest boy in the world.</p>`

        description: "A group of friends find a secret in an old house.",
        pages: [
            `<h3>Chapter 1: The Haunted House</h3>
            <p>On the edge of the town, there was an old house. Nobody lived there. The windows were broken. The garden was full of tall grass.</p>
            <p>People said the house was haunted. "Don't go there," parents told their children. "It is dangerous."</p>
            <p>But Leo, Maya, and Toby were curious. They were twelve years old. They liked mysteries. One summer afternoon, they stood in front of the gate.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: Dare to Enter</h3>
            <p>"I dare you to go inside," said Toby. He was the bravest of the three. "I'm not afraid," said Leo.</p>
            <p>"But the door is locked," said Maya. She was smart and careful. She looked at the heavy wooden door.</p>
            <p>Leo pushed the gate. *Creaaaak.* It opened slowly. "Let's just look at the garden," he suggested. They walked through the tall grass.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Open Window</h3>
            <p>They walked around the house. The back of the house was very dark. "Look!" whispered Maya. She pointed up.</p>
            <p>There was a window on the ground floor. It was open a little bit. "We can climb in," said Toby.</p>
            <p>"We shouldn't," said Maya. "It's trespassing." But curiosity was stronger than fear. Toby climbed through the window first.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: Inside the Dusty Room</h3>
            <p>Leo and Maya followed Toby. They were in a large room. It was a living room. Everything was covered in white sheets.</p>
            <p>"It is so dusty," sneezed Leo. *Achoo!* The sound echoed in the empty house.</p>
            <p>"Shhh!" said Toby. "Ghosts might hear us." He laughed, but he looked nervous too. The air smelled old and musty.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: The Grand Hallway</h3>
            <p>They walked into the hallway. There was a big staircase. On the wall, there were old paintings of serious people.</p>
            <p>"They are watching us," said Leo. He felt cold. "Let's go back," said Maya.</p>
            <p>Then they saw it. At the end of the hallway, there was a huge clock. It was a grandfather clock, made of dark wood.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: The Strange Clock</h3>
            <p>The clock was taller than Toby. It had a gold face. But the hands were not moving. It stopped at 12:00.</p>
            <p>"It's beautiful," said Maya. She touched the wood. It was smooth. "Why did they leave this behind?"</p>
            <p>Toby tried to open the glass door of the clock. It was locked. "I hear something," said Leo suddenly. *Tick, tock, tick, tock.*</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: It Started Ticking</h3>
            <p>"The clock!" shouted Leo. "It started ticking!" They all jumped back. The sound was loud in the silent house.</p>
            <p>"But nobody touched it," said Maya. Her eyes were wide. "How is that possible?"</p>
            <p>"Maybe it's a ghost," whispered Toby. He was not laughing now. *Clang!* The clock struck one time. It was very loud.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Hidden Drawer</h3>
            <p>When the clock struck, something happened. A small drawer popped open at the bottom of the clock.</p>
            <p>"Look!" said Maya. She knelt down. Passing the dust, she saw a piece of paper inside the drawer.</p>
            <p>"What is it?" asked Leo. Maya took the paper. It was yellow and old. There was writing on it.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 9: The Riddle</h3>
            <p>Maya read the paper aloud. "To find the gold, you must be bold. Look where the sun sleeps."</p>
            <p>"It's a riddle!" said Leo excitedly. "A treasure hunt!" Toby forgot about the ghosts. "Gold? Real gold?"</p>
            <p>"'Where the sun sleeps'..." repeated Maya. "Where does the sun sleep? The West?"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 10: Solving the Riddle</h3>
            <p>"The sun sets in the West," said Maya ("sets" means goes down). "So we need to look at the West side of the house."</p>
            <p>They ran to the window. "This window faces West," said Leo. They looked outside. There was only the old garden.</p>
            <p>"No," said Maya. "Maybe inside the room. The West wall." They looked at the wall. There was a fireplace.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 11: The Fireplace</h3>
            <p>The fireplace was made of stone. It was empty and dirty. "Look inside," said Toby.</p>
            <p>Leo looked up the chimney. "I see nothing. Just soot." He rubbed his dirty nose.</p>
            <p>"Wait," said Maya. She pointed to a stone. It had a symbol of a sun on it. "Push that stone!"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 12: The Secret Compartment</h3>
            <p>Toby pushed the stone. It didn't move. "Push harder!" said Leo. They all pushed together. One, two, three!</p>
            <p>*Click.* The stone moved back. Behind it, there was a small hole. Leo put his hand inside.</p>
            <p>"Be careful!" said Maya. "There might be spiders." Leo pulled his hand out quickly. He was holding a small metal box.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 13: The Locked Box</h3>
            <p>The box was rusty. It had a lock. "We need a key," said Toby. "Is the key in the clock?"</p>
            <p>They ran back to the clock. They looked in the drawer. Empty. They looked under the clock. Nothing.</p>
            <p>"Maybe the riddle tells us," said Maya. She looked at the paper again. There was nothing else on it.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 14: A Noise Upstairs</h3>
            <p>Suddenly, they heard footsteps. *Thump, thump, thump.* The sound came from upstairs.</p>
            <p>"Someone is here!" whispered Leo. They froze. The footsteps were heavy. They were coming towards the stairs.</p>
            <p>"Back out the window!" said Toby. "Run!" They grabbed the box and ran to the living room.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 15: The Escape</h3>
            <p>They climbed out the window quickly. Maya went first, then Leo. Toby was last. He almost tripped.</p>
            <p>They ran through the tall grass. They didn't look back. They ran all the way to the gate.</p>
            <p>When they were on the street, they stopped. They were breathing hard. "Who was that?" asked Leo.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 16: Trying to Open the Box</h3>
            <p>They went to the park to look at the box. They tried to open it with a hairpin from Maya's hair.</p>
            <p>It didn't work. The lock was too strong. "We should break it," said Toby. He found a rock.</p>
            <p>*Bang! Bang!* He hit the lock. Finally, it broke. The lid opened.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 17: The Treasure</h3>
            <p>Inside the box, there was no gold. There were no diamonds. The children were disappointed.</p>
            <p>"Just old photos?" said Toby. He picked up a black and white photo. It showed a family in front of the old house.</p>
            <p>"And letters," said Maya. She opened a letter. "My dearest Elizabeth..." it began.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 18: Understanding the Story</h3>
            <p>Maya read the letters. They were love letters from a soldier to his wife. He hid them before he went to war.</p>
            <p>"This is better than gold," said Maya softly. "It's someone's memories. Important memories."</p>
            <p>"But who are they?" asked Leo. "Look at the name," said Maya. "Elizabeth Blackwood."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 19: Finding the Owner</h3>
            <p>"Mrs. Blackwood!" said Leo. "She lives in the nursing home. My mom knows her."</p>
            <p>They decided to take the box to Mrs. Blackwood. When they arrived, an old lady was sitting in a wheelchair.</p>
            <p>Maya showed her the box. Mrs. Blackwood started to cry. "My letters! I thought they were lost forever!"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 20: The Real Reward</h3>
            <p>Mrs. Blackwood told them stories about the old house. She told them about her husband. She was so happy.</p>
            <p>"You gave me back my past," she said. She gave them cookies and lemonade.</p>
            <p>As they walked home, Leo smiled. "We didn't find gold," he said. "But we solved the mystery." "And we made someone happy," said Maya. That was the best treasure.</p>`

            `<h3>Chapter 1: The Problem</h3>
            <p>Della counted her money again. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all she had. And tomorrow was Christmas.</p>
            <p>She wanted to buy a present for her husband, Jim. But one dollar and eighty-seven cents was not enough. She sat down on the old sofa and cried.</p>
            <p>Della and Jim were very poor, but they loved each other very much. Jim worked hard every day, but his salary was small. They lived in a small apartment with old furniture.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: Della's Treasure</h3>
            <p>Della stopped crying and looked in the mirror. She had beautiful long brown hair. It reached below her knees. It was her most precious possession.</p>
            <p>Jim had one precious thing too. It was a gold watch. The watch belonged to his father and his grandfather. Jim loved his watch very much.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Della had an idea. She put on her old brown jacket and went outside quickly.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Hair Shop</h3>
            <p>Della walked to a shop. The sign said: "Madame Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." Della went inside.</p>
            <p>"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della. Madame Sofronie looked at Della's beautiful hair.</p>
            <p>"Twenty dollars," said Madame. Della's heart beat fast. Twenty dollars! That was enough!</p>
            <p>"Cut it off quickly," said Della. Soon, her beautiful long hair was gone. But Della had twenty-one dollars and eighty-seven cents.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: The Perfect Gift</h3>
            <p>Della went to many shops. She looked for the perfect gift for Jim. Then she found it! It was a platinum watch chain.</p>
            <p>The chain was simple but elegant. It was perfect for Jim's gold watch. Della paid twenty-one dollars for it.</p>
            <p>She went home with her package. She was nervous and excited. Her hair was very short now. Would Jim still think she was beautiful?</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: Jim Comes Home</h3>
            <p>At seven o'clock, Della heard Jim's steps on the stairs. She always heard Jim's steps. She said a little prayer: "Please God, make him think I am still pretty."</p>
            <p>The door opened. Jim came in and closed the door. He looked thin and cold. He needed a new coat. He looked at Della, and a strange expression came on his face.</p>
            <p>"Jim!" Della cried. "Don't look at me like that! I sold my hair to buy you a Christmas present."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: Jim's Reactions</h3>
            <p>"You cut your hair?" said Jim slowly. "Yes," said Della. "But I will always love you. My hair grows quickly, Jim!"</p>
            <p>Jim put a package on the table. "Della, no haircut could make me love you less. Open your present."</p>
            <p>Della opened the package with shaking fingers. Then she screamed with joy! Inside were beautiful combs for her hair—expensive combs that she always wanted. But now her hair was too short to use them.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: The Exchange</h3>
            <p>Della gave Jim his present. "I hope you still like it," she said.</p>
            <p>Jim smiled sadly. "Della," he said, "I sold my watch to buy your combs."</p>
            <p>They looked at each other and started to laugh. They had both given up their most precious possessions for each other.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Wisest Gift</h3>
            <p>That night, Della and Jim sat together on their old sofa. They had no expensive gifts to use. But they had something more valuable.</p>
            <p>They had their love for each other. And that was the greatest Christmas gift of all.</p>
            <p><strong>The End.</strong> The wise men who brought gifts to Jesus were called the Magi. Della and Jim were wise like the Magi because they understood that love is the greatest gift.</p>`

        description: "The classic story of survival on a deserted island.",
        pages: [
            `<h3>Chapter 1: The Storm</h3>
            <p>I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York. From a young age, I wanted to go to sea. My father told me asking me to stay home, but I did not listen.</p>
            <p>One day, I boarded a ship bound for London. But a terrible storm began. The wind blew furiously, and the waves were like mountains.</p>
            <p>The ship struck a sandbank. "Abandon ship!" cried the captain. We jumped into a small boat, but a giant wave overturned us. I was swallowed by the sea.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: Shipwrecked</h3>
            <p>I do not know how long I was in the water. I swam with all my strength. Finally, a wave threw me onto the shore.</p>
            <p>I was alive, but I was alone. All my friends were gone. I looked around. I was on a wild, desolate island.</p>
            <p>I had no food, no water, and no weapon. I was afraid of wild beasts. I climbed a tree and slept there until morning.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Wreckage</h3>
            <p>The next morning, the storm had passed. I saw the ship stuck on the sand, not far from the shore. I swam out to it.</p>
            <p>I made a raft from pieces of wood. I loaded it with everything I could find: bread, rice, cheese, and some tools.</p>
            <p>I also found two pistols, some powder, and two swords. These were the most valuable things to me.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: Building a Shelter</h3>
            <p>I brought my raft to the shore. I needed a safe place to live. I found a small cave in the side of a hill.</p>
            <p>I decided to build a wall in front of the cave. I used strong stakes and cables from the ship. It was hard work.</p>
            <p>I made a tent inside the wall to protect myself from the rain and the sun. This became my fortress.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: Keeping Track of Time</h3>
            <p>I was afraid I would lose track of time. So, I cut a large post into the shape of a cross.</p>
            <p>Every day, I made a small cut on the post with my knife. Every seventh day, I made a longer cut. This was my calendar.</p>
            <p>I realized I was completely alone. I had only a dog and two cats from the ship as my companions.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: Hunting and Gathering</h3>
            <p>I needed food. I went hunting with my gun. I found many goats on the island. I shot one and brought it home.</p>
            <p>I felt sad killing the goat, but I had to eat. Later, I learned to catch the goats alive.</p>
            <p>I also found wild fruits—grapes and lemons. I dried the grapes in the sun to make raisins. They were delicious.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: The Earthquake</h3>
            <p>One day, while I was inside my cave, the ground began to shake. It was a terrible earthquake!</p>
            <p>Rocks fell from the ceiling. I ran outside, terrified. The sea was boiling. I thought the island would sink.</p>
            <p>The shaking stopped after a few minutes, but I was very scared. I realized nowhere was safe.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: Sickness</h3>
            <p>Weeks later, I became very sick. I had a fever and cold chills. I was too weak to stand up.</p>
            <p>I lay in my bed, thirsty and feverish. I thought I was going to die. I prayed to God for the first time in many years.</p>
            <p>"Lord, help me, for I am in great distress," I whispered. Slowly, my fever went down.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 9: The Dream</h3>
            <p>While I was sick, I had a strange dream. A man descended from a black cloud in a bright flame.</p>
            <p>He held a spear in his hand. He said, "Seeing all these things have not brought you to repentance, now thou shalt die."</p>
            <p>I woke up crying. The dream made me think about my life and my mistakes. I promised to be a better man.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 10: Exploring the Island</h3>
            <p>When I was healthy again, I decided to explore the other side of the island. It was beautiful there.</p>
            <p>There were many flowers and parrots. I caught a young parrot and taught him to speak. His name was Poll.</p>
            <p>I also found turtles on the beach. Their meat was very good, and their eggs were tasty.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 11: Making Pots</h3>
            <p>I needed containers to store water and grain. I tried to make pots from clay. It was very difficult.</p>
            <p>My first pots broke in the sun. But I did not give up. I learned to fire them in a kiln.</p>
            <p>Finally, I had strong, red pots. I was so happy! Now I could boil water and make soup.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 12: Farming</h3>
            <p>I found some stalks of barley and rice growing near my cave. I must have dropped some seeds from the ship.</p>
            <p>I carefully saved the seeds. I planted them and waited for the rain. It took a long time, but eventually, I had a harvest.</p>
            <p>I learned to bake bread. It was crude and hard, but to me, it tasted like the best cake in England.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 13: Building a Canoe</h3>
            <p>I wanted to escape the island. I decided to build a boat. I found a huge cedar tree and cut it down.</p>
            <p>For months, I dug out the inside of the tree with my axe and fire. It was a magnificent canoe.</p>
            <p>But when I finished, I realized a terrible mistake. It was too heavy! I could not move it to the water.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 14: Footprint in the Sand</h3>
            <p>Fifteen years had passed. I thought I was the only human on the island. But one day, I saw something that terrified me.</p>
            <p>It was a footprint in the sand. A naked human foot! I stood there like one thunderstruck.</p>
            <p>I listened. I looked around. I saw nothing. I ran back to my fortress and stayed there for three days.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 15: Cannibals</h3>
            <p>I strengthened my walls. I loaded all my guns. I was living in fear again.</p>
            <p>One morning, I saw smoke on the shore. I climbed a hill and looked through my telescope.</p>
            <p>I saw savages dancing around a fire. They were cannibals! They were eating human flesh. I was horrified.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 16: Friday</h3>
            <p>Years later, the savages returned. They brought two prisoners. They killed one immediately.</p>
            <p>The other prisoner started to run. He ran towards my fortress. Two savages chased him. I had to help him.</p>
            <p>I shot one savage and knocked down the other. The prisoner stopped. He knelt before me.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 17: Teaching Friday</h3>
            <p>I named him Friday, because that was the day I saved his life. He was a handsome native with tawny skin.</p>
            <p>I taught him to speak English. I taught him to eat goat meat instead of human flesh. He became my faithful servant.</p>
            <p>Friday told me about the mainland and the other white men who lived there. I started to hope for rescue.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 18: The English Ship</h3>
            <p>One morning, Friday came running to me. "Master! Master! A great ship!" he shouted.</p>
            <p>I looked out. It was an English ship! But something was wrong. A boat came to shore with prisoners.</p>
            <p>It was a mutiny. The sailors had taken the captain prisoner and wanted to leave him on the island.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 19: The Battle</h3>
            <p>We made a plan with the captain. We attacked the mutineers at night. They were surprised and scared.</p>
            <p>"The governor of the island commands you to surrender!" shouted the captain. The sailors dropped their weapons.</p>
            <p>We retook the ship. The captain was so grateful. "The ship is yours," he said to me.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 20: Leaving the Island</h3>
            <p>I had lived on the island for twenty-eight years. Now, it was time to leave.</p>
            <p>I took my big goatskin cap, my umbrella, and my parrot. I left the mutineers on the island to survive as I had.</p>
            <p>As the ship sailed away, I looked back at my island one last time. It had been my prison, but also my home.</p>`

        pages: [
            `<h3>Chapter 1: Saturday Morning Punishment</h3>
            <p>Saturday morning came, and all the summer world was bright and fresh. Tom Sawyer appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He looked at the fence, and all happiness left him.</p>
            <p>Thirty yards of board fence, nine feet high! Life seemed hopeless to him. He began to whitewash, then sat down to think of something better to do.</p>
            <p>Jim came skipping out of the gate with a tin bucket, singing. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes before, but now it didn't seem so bad.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: A Bribe Attempt</h3>
            <p>Tom remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and Black boys and girls always waited there, resting and playing games while they waited for their turn.</p>
            <p>"Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some." Jim shook his head. "Can't, Tom. Old missus told me I got to go and get the water. She said she'd scold me if I didn't do it."</p>
            <p>"Oh, never mind what she said, Jim. She talks like that all the time. Give me the bucket—I won't be gone only a minute." But Jim was afraid of punishment.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: Ben Rogers Appears</h3>
            <p>At this dark moment, Ben Rogers came into sight. He was eating an apple and making sounds like a steamboat. As he drew near, he slowed down.</p>
            <p>"Stop the steamboat! Ding-dong-ding!" Ben pretended to be a boat captain. Tom went on whitewashing—pretended not to see Ben.</p>
            <p>"Hi-yi! You're up a stump, ain't you!" said Ben. Tom looked at him for a moment and said: "Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't noticing."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: The Psychology</h3>
            <p>"Say, I'm going in swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of course, you'd rather work—wouldn't you? Course you would!"</p>
            <p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said: "What do you call work?" "Why, ain't that work?" Ben pointed at the fence.</p>
            <p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly: "Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer."</p>
            <p>"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you like it?" "Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: The Reverse Psychology Works</h3>
            <p>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped eating his apple. Tom swept his brush back and forth, stepped back to note the effect, added a touch here and there.</p>
            <p>Ben watched every move, getting more and more interested. Presently he said: "Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."</p>
            <p>Tom considered, was about to consent, but he changed his mind: "No—no—I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's very particular about this fence."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: The Trade</h3>
            <p>"Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I'll give you the core of my apple."</p>
            <p>"Well, here— No, Ben, now don't. I'm afraid—" "I'll give you all of it!" Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but happiness in his heart.</p>
            <p>While Ben worked and sweated in the sun, Tom sat on a barrel in the shade close by, swung his legs, munched his apple, and planned how to trap more boys.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: More Victims</h3>
            <p>There was no lack of material. Boys came along every little while. They came to make fun, but stayed to whitewash.</p>
            <p>By the time Ben was tired out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite. When Billy got tired, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat on a string.</p>
            <p>And so on, hour after hour. By the middle of the afternoon, Tom had accumulated quite a treasure: twelve marbles, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, and many other valuable items.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Discovery</h3>
            <p>Tom had discovered a great law of human action: in order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to obtain.</p>
            <p>If Tom had been a great philosopher, he would have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.</p>
            <p>The fence had three coats of whitewash on it! Tom was no longer poor. He had had a nice, idle time all the while, with plenty of company, and the fence had been whitewashed.</p>
            <p><strong>The End of This Adventure.</strong> Tom had learned that work could be turned into play with the right attitude—or the right trick!</p>`

        pages: [
            `<h3>Chapter 1: A Visit to Baker Street</h3>
            <p>To Sherlock Holmes, she is always <em>the</em> woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes, she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.</p>
            <p>One night in March, 1888, I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street.</p>
            <p>I saw the light in the window and knew that Holmes was still awake. I decided to visit my old friend.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: Deduction</h3>
            <p>Holmes welcomed me. "Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."</p>
            <p>"Seven!" I answered.</p>
            <p>"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."</p>
            <p>"Then, how do you know?" "I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Explanation</h3>
            <p>"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. It is true that I had a walk in the country on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it."</p>
            <p>"It is simplicity itself," said he. "My eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts."</p>
            <p>"Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud. Hence, you had a clumsy servant."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: A Mysterious King</h3>
            <p>Holmes then showed me a letter. It arrived by the last post. It had no date, and no signature.</p>
            <p>"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock, a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment."</p>
            <p>"This matter involves the Great House of one of the Courts of Europe," the letter said. "Be in your room then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: The Masked Visitor</h3>
            <p>At exactly a quarter to eight, a brougham stopped outside the door. A man entered. He was over six feet tall and possessed a chest and limbs of a Hercules.</p>
            <p>He wore a black mask over his face. "You received my note?" he asked with a deep, harsh voice and a strong German accent.</p>
            <p>"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Whom have I the honour to address?"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: The King of Bohemia</h3>
            <p>"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman," said the visitor.</p>
            <p>Holmes looked at him. "Your Majesty had not yet spoken," he said calmly.</p>
            <p>The man jumped up and tore the mask from his face. "You are right!" he cried. "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?" He was indeed Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, King of Bohemia.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: The Photograph</h3>
            <p>"I have come to you for help," said the King. "It is about a photograph."</p>
            <p>"Five years ago, during a visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. We were... close."</p>
            <p>"I am now about to be married to Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. She is very strict. If she knows about Irene Adler, the marriage is off."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Threat</h3>
            <p>"Irene Adler has a photograph of us together," continued the King. "She threatens to send it to my fiancée on the day of the betrothal."</p>
            <p>"We must get it back," said Holmes. "I have tried," said the King. "I have had her house searched. I have had her luggage stolen. It is not there."</p>
            <p>"She is clever," said Holmes. "She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet," said the King. "But she has a soul of steel."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 9: The Plan</h3>
            <p>The next morning, Holmes went out disguised as a groom. He went to Irene Adler's house, Briony Lodge.</p>
            <p>He found out that she had a regular visitor, a lawyer named Mr. Godfrey Norton. And today, something strange happened.</p>
            <p>Norton came in a cab. Then Irene Adler came out and took another cab. Holmes followed them to the church of St. Monica.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 10: The Wedding</h3>
            <p>At the church, Holmes witnessed a surprising event. Irene Adler and Godfrey Norton were getting married!</p>
            <p>They needed a witness. They saw Holmes (in his disguise) and dragged him to the altar.</p>
            <p>Holmes signed the register. "It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life," he told me later.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 11: The Trap</h3>
            <p>Holmes returned to Baker Street. "She is married now," he said. "That changes things. But we still need the photograph."</p>
            <p>He asked for my help. "When I raise my hand, you will throw a smoke rocket into the room and cry 'Fire!'," he instructed.</p>
            <p>We went to Briony Lodge that evening. Holmes disguised himself as a clergyman. He pretended to get into a fight outside her house and was injured.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 12: Inside the House</h3>
            <p>Irene Adler saw the "injured" clergyman and brought him into her sitting room.</p>
            <p>I waited outside. When Holmes waved his hand, I threw the rocket through the window.</p>
            <p>"Fire!" I shouted. The people in the street shouted "Fire!" It was chaos.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 13: The Hiding Place</h3>
            <p>When a woman thinks her house is on fire, her instinct is to save what she values most.</p>
            <p>Holmes saw Irene Adler rush to a secret panel behind a bell-pull. She took out a photograph.</p>
            <p>Seeing it was a false alarm, she replaced it. Holmes now knew where the photograph was hidden.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 14: Escaping</h3>
            <p>Holmes left the house, thanking her. He met me outside. "I know where it is," he said.</p>
            <p>"Tomorrow, the King and I will call on her and take the photograph," he explained.</p>
            <p>As we walked home, a young man passed us. "Good-night, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," he said. Holmes looked surprised. "I've heard that voice before," he said.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 15: The Empty Nest</h3>
            <p>The next morning, Holmes, the King, and I went to Briony Lodge. An old woman opened the door.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" she said. "My mistress told me you were likely to call. She left this morning."</p>
            <p>"Left!" shouted the King. "Gone! Married to Mr. Norton. They have left England forever."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 16: The Letter</h3>
            <p>We rushed into the sitting room. Holmes opened the secret panel. The photograph was gone!</p>
            <p>In its place was another photograph—of Irene Adler alone—and a letter addressed to Sherlock Holmes.</p>
            <p>Holmes opened it and read it aloud. It was a clever letter.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 17: Irene's Victory</h3>
            <p>"You did it very well," the letter said. "I was completely deceived by the fire alarm. But I suspected you."</p>
            <p>"The 'young man' who said good-night to you was me in disguise. I wanted to confirm who you were."</p>
            <p>"As for the photograph, the King may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. I will not use it against him."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 18: The King's Reaction</h3>
            <p>"What a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia. "Did I not tell you how quick she is? Would she not have made an admirable queen?"</p>
            <p>"Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"</p>
            <p>"From what I have seen of the lady," said Holmes coldly, "she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 19: The Payment</h3>
            <p>"I am immensely indebted to you," said the King. He took off a heavy emerald ring. "Please accept this ring."</p>
            <p>"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.</p>
            <p>"You have but to name it." "This photograph!" said Holmes. The King was surprised. "Certainly, if you wish it."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 20: The Woman</h3>
            <p>And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit.</p>
            <p>He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late.</p>
            <p>And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of <em>the</em> woman.</p>`

        description: "A chilling tale of guilt and madness.",
        pages: [
            `<h3>Part 1: True—Nervous</h3>
            <p>True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute.</p>
            <p>I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Observe how healthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole story.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 2: The Eye</h3>
            <p>I think it was his eye! Yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold.</p>
            <p>And so by degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.</p>
            <p>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to work!</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 3: Seven Long Nights</h3>
            <p>I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh so gently!</p>
            <p>And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head.</p>
            <p>Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 4: The Eighth Night</h3>
            <p>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.</p>
            <p>To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea.</p>
            <p>I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out—"Who's there?"</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 5: The Heartbeat</h3>
            <p>I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle. Presently I heard a slight groan. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul.</p>
            <p>I knew it well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening the terrors that distracted me.</p>
            <p>And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 6: The Deed</h3>
            <p>In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound.</p>
            <p>This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead.</p>
            <p>I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 7: The Concealment</h3>
            <p>If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. I worked hastily, but in silence.</p>
            <p>First of all, I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings.</p>
            <p>I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 8: The Police Arrive</h3>
            <p>When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door.</p>
            <p>I went down to open it with a light heart—for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night.</p>
            <p>I smiled—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 9: The Sound Returns</h3>
            <p>At length, I led them into his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.</p>
            <p>The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears.</p>
            <p>The ringing became more distinct. I talked more fluently to get rid of the feeling, but it continued. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations. The sound increased!</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 10: The Confession</h3>
            <p>It grew louder!—louder!—louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? No, no! They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of my horror!</p>
            <p>But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer!</p>
            <p>"Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear up the planks! here, here!—It is the beating of his hideous heart!"</p>
            <p><strong>The End.</strong> The narrator's own guilt drove him to madness and confession.</p>`

        description: "A dystopian novel about totalitarianism and surveillance.",
        pages: [
            `<h3>Chapter 1: Big Brother is Watching</h3>
            <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions.</p>
            <p>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.</p>
            <p>It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: The Telescreen</h3>
            <p>Inside his flat, a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall.</p>
            <p>Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.</p>
            <p>He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Ministry of Truth</h3>
            <p>Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals.</p>
            <p>In the distance, a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight.</p>
            <p>It was the Police Patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: War is Peace</h3>
            <p>Winston worked at the Ministry of Truth. His job was to rectify original figures by making them agree with the later ones.</p>
            <p>He glanced up at the enormous pyramidal structure of white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, three hundred metres into the air.</p>
            <p>On the white face of the building, the three slogans of the Party were written in elegant lettering: WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: Two Minutes Hate</h3>
            <p>At eleven hundred hours, Winston went to the Two Minutes Hate. People gathered in front of a large telescreen.</p>
            <p>The face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, appeared. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party.</p>
            <p>Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see Goldstein's face without a painful mixture of emotions. But soon, the hate took over. People screamed and threw things at the screen.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: Thoughtcrime</h3>
            <p>After the Hate, Winston went home. He sat in a shallow alcove that was out of sight of the telescreen.</p>
            <p>He took out a diary. This was a dangerous act. If he were caught, it meant death, or at least twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp.</p>
            <p>He dipped his pen in the ink and wrote: <em>April 4th, 1984.</em> Then he wrote, in large clumsy capitals: DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: The Parson Family</h3>
            <p>There was a knock at the door. Winston started violently. It was Mrs. Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor.</p>
            <p>"Comrade," she said, "could you come and have a look at our kitchen sink? It's blocked."</p>
            <p>Her children were playing in the living room. They were dressed in the uniform of the Spies. "Traitor!" yelled the boy. "Thought-criminal!" screamed the girl. It was not altogether a game.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Dream</h3>
            <p>That night, Winston dreamt of his mother. She was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms.</p>
            <p>He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was up here.</p>
            <p>He knew that she had sacrificed herself for him. It was a memory of a time when there were still privacy and love and friendship.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 9: Ingsoc</h3>
            <p>Winston woke up with the word "Shakespeare" on his lips. The telescreen was whistling. It was time for the Physical Jerks.</p>
            <p>He thought about the past. The Party claimed that it had liberated the proles from bondage. But was it true?</p>
            <p>The history books said that before the Revolution, people were oppressed by capitalists in top hats. But Winston could not remember.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 10: The Proles</h3>
            <p>"If there is hope," wrote Winston, "it lies in the proles." The proles were the working class, eighty-five per cent of the population.</p>
            <p>The Party did not care about the proles. "Proles and animals are free," was the Party slogan.</p>
            <p>Winston walked through the prole quarters. He saw poverty, but he also saw freedom. They could sing, they could love, they could shout.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 11: The Antique Shop</h3>
            <p>Winston found a small junk shop in a slummy quarter. The owner was an old man named Charrington.</p>
            <p>Winston bought a glass paperweight. It was a heavy lump of glass with a pink coral inside. It belonged to an age quite different from the present one.</p>
            <p>Mr. Charrington showed him a room upstairs. It had no telescreen! It was a sanctuary.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 12: The Note</h3>
            <p>One day at work, a dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department stumbled and fell near Winston.</p>
            <p>He helped her up. She slipped a piece of paper into his hand. He was terrified. Was she a Thought Police agent?</p>
            <p>Later, he read the note. It said: <em>I love you.</em> He was stunned.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 13: The Meeting</h3>
            <p>They managed to meet in the countryside, away from microphones and telescreens. Her name was Julia.</p>
            <p>She hated the Party too, but in a different way. She wanted to have a good time. She broke the rules whenever she could.</p>
            <p>"I hate purity, I hate goodness," Winston told her. "I want everyone to be corrupt."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 14: The Room</h3>
            <p>Winston rented the room above Mr. Charrington's shop. It became their secret hiding place.</p>
            <p>They met there often. They drank real coffee and ate real sugar, which Julia stole from the Inner Party.</p>
            <p>But Winston knew it could not last. "We are the dead," he said. "We are the dead," echoed Julia.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 15: O'Brien</h3>
            <p>Winston believed that O'Brien, a high-ranking Inner Party member, was secretly an enemy of the Party.</p>
            <p>One day, O'Brien stopped Winston in the corridor. He invited Winston to his flat to pick up a dictionary.</p>
            <p>Winston and Julia went to O'Brien's luxurious apartment. O'Brien turned off the telescreen! Winston was amazed.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 16: The Brotherhood</h3>
            <p>They told O'Brien they wanted to join the Brotherhood, the secret organization against the Party.</p>
            <p>O'Brien gave them wine. They toasted to the past. He promised to send them "The Book", written by Goldstein.</p>
            <p>Winston felt a surge of hope. Maybe the Party could be overthrown.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 17: The Arrest</h3>
            <p>One night, Winston and Julia were in their room. They were looking at the paperweight. "The coral was Julia's life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal," thought Winston.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, an iron voice spoke behind them. "You are the dead." It came from behind the picture on the wall!</p>
            <p>The picture fell. There was a telescreen behind it. The Thought Police burst in. Mr. Charrington entered. He was not an old man anymore. He was a Thought Police officer.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 18: Room 101</h3>
            <p>Winston was taken to the Ministry of Love. He was tortured and starved. He confessed to everything.</p>
            <p>But he still had not betrayed Julia. He still loved her. O'Brien was his torturer. "You must love Big Brother," O'Brien said.</p>
            <p>Finally, Winston was taken to Room 101. It contained "the worst thing in the world". For Winston, it was rats.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 19: Betrayal</h3>
            <p>O'Brien brought a cage full of starving rats near Winston's face. Winston was terrified out of his wits.</p>
            <p>He screamed the only thing that could save him. "Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me!"</p>
            <p>He had betrayed her. He had put himself first. The cage clicked shut. He was safe, but he was broken.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 20: He Loved Big Brother</h3>
            <p>Winston was released. He sat in the Chestnut Tree Cafe, drinking gin. He saw Julia. She had changed. Her body was stiff.</p>
            <p>He looked up at the poster. The forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. Two gin-scented tears trickled down his nose. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.</p>`

        pages: [
            `<h3>Chapter 1: The Studio</h3>
            <p>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.</p>
            <p>From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs.</p>
            <p>And now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: The Portrait</h3>
            <p>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," Lord Henry murmured, as he examined the portrait in the brilliant sunlight. "You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor."</p>
            <p>"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," Basil Hallward answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. "No, I won't send it anywhere."</p>
            <p>Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. "Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are!"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Secret</h3>
            <p>"Artists are always strange. They live on their nerves, like horses. But why won't you exhibit this? It is quite beautiful." "I know you will laugh at me," replied Basil, "but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."</p>
            <p>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed. "Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same."</p>
            <p>"Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: Dorian's Arrival</h3>
            <p>"He is all my art to me now," said the painter gravely. "I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world's history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also."</p>
            <p>"To discover the real personality of Dorian Gray is to me like a revelation. Every day I seem to understand him better. His personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style."</p>
            <p>As he was speaking, the door opened and a young man came in. His finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair seemed to have the qualities of youth itself. There was something in his face that made one trust him at once.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: Lord Henry's Philosophy</h3>
            <p>"You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too charming." And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case.</p>
            <p>"Youth! There is nothing like it. It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder."</p>
            <p>"As for the aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: The Terrible Wish</h3>
            <p>When Basil finished the portrait, Dorian looked at it for a long time. "How sad it is!" he murmured. "I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June."</p>
            <p>"If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!"</p>
            <p>"You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say." The painter stared in amazement at Dorian. He had never seen him like this before.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: The Transformation Begins</h3>
            <p>Days and weeks passed, and Dorian began to live the life Lord Henry had described. He became the embodiment of a new hedonism. Yet there was something tragic in it, something that seemed to fill him with a sense of terror.</p>
            <p>One day, after a particularly cruel rejection of a young actress who loved him, Dorian returned home. He noticed something strange about the portrait. Was it possible? The expression on the painted face had changed! There was a touch of cruelty in the mouth that had not been there before.</p>
            <p>With a wild sense of horror, he realized that his wish had come true. The portrait would bear the burden of his sins, while he would remain eternally young and beautiful. It was his conscience made visible—a terrible mirror of the soul.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Price of Beauty</h3>
            <p>Years passed. Dorian's face remained untouched by time or vice, while the portrait grew ever more hideous. He hid it in his old schoolroom upstairs, locked behind a curtain, where no one could see the grotesque transformation.</p>
            <p>He pursued every sensation, every pleasure, every sin. The more corrupt he became, the more beautiful he appeared to the world. Society adored him. Women loved him. Men envied him.</p>
            <p>But the portrait knew the truth. It captured every lie, every betrayal, every act of cruelty. The painted face aged and twisted, becoming a monstrous reflection of what Dorian truly was beneath the surface.</p>
            <p><strong>Excerpt Ends.</strong> In the complete novel, Dorian's desperate attempt to destroy the portrait—and thus his conscience—leads to his own destruction. The price of eternal youth is the loss of one's soul.</p>`

            `<h3>Chapter 1: The Tower</h3>
            <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.
            A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned: <em>Introibo ad altare Dei.</em></p>
            <p>Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: "Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!"
            Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.</p>
            <p>He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: The School</h3>
            <p>Stephen Dedalus taught in Mr. Deasy's school. The boys were shouting in the playground.
            "Hockey!" they cried. "Hockey!"
            Mr. Deasy, a small man with a fussy manner, called Stephen into his study.</p>
            <p>"I paid you this morning, didn't I?" he asked. Stephen nodded.
            "I like to settle my debts," said Mr. Deasy. "It is a good principle."</p>
            <p>He began to talk about history and politics. "History," said Stephen, "is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: Proteus</h3>
            <p>Stephen walked along the Sandymount strand. The tide was out.
            Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time. A very short space of time through very short times of space.</p>
            <p>Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick, crick.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: Calypso</h3>
            <p>Mr. Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes.</p>
            <p>Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.
            Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.</p>
            <p>The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high. "Mkgnao!" she said.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: Lotus Eaters</h3>
            <p>Bloom walked along the street. He stopped at a shop window.
            He looked at the high tea canisters. Tea. It was a good thing.
            He went into the post office to pick up a letter. A letter from Martha.</p>
            <p>He hid the letter in his pocket. He would read it later, in secret.
            He imagined the East. The languid floating flower. The lotus. Forgetfulness.</p>
            <p>He walked on, thinking of his bath. A nice warm bath. He felt the anticipation of the water on his skin.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: Hades</h3>
            <p>Bloom entered the funeral carriage accurately. Martin Cunningham, Mr. Power, and Simon Dedalus were inside.
            They were going to Paddy Dignam's funeral.</p>
            <p>They drove through the streets of Dublin. They passed statues and buildings.
            "Poor Paddy," said Mr. Power. "He's gone."</p>
            <p>Bloom looked out the window. He thought about death. It was the end of everything. Or was it?
            A child's coffin passed by. A tiny white thing. Sad.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: Aeolus</h3>
            <p>In the heart of the Hibernian Metropolis. The newspaper office.
            The machines were clanking. The noise was deafening.
            Bloom was trying to place an ad.</p>
            <p>The editor, Myles Crawford, was shouting orders.
            Stephen Dedalus came in with his letter on the foot and mouth disease.
            "We want something with bite in it," said the editor.</p>
            <p>The wind blew through the open window. Aeolus, the god of winds.
            News. It blew in and out like the wind.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: Lestrygonians</h3>
            <p>Bloom was hungry. He walked through the city, looking for lunch.
            He passed the Burton restaurant. The smell of food was overpowering.
            Men were eating like animals. Stuffing food into their mouths.</p>
            <p>He felt disgusted. He couldn't eat there.
            He found a quieter place, Davy Byrne's pub.
            He ordered a cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy.</p>
            <p>He ate slowly, savouring the taste. Mild fire of wine kindled his veins.
            He thought about his wife, Molly. And the past.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 9: Scylla and Charybdis</h3>
            <p>In the National Library, Stephen was talking about Shakespeare.
            He had a theory about Hamlet. That Hamlet was Shakespeare, and the ghost was his father.
            Or maybe Hamlet was the son, Hamnet.</p>
            <p>The librarians listened skeptically. Buck Mulligan came in, mocking Stephen as usual.
            "The bard!" he cried. "The bard of Avon!"</p>
            <p>Stephen felt isolated in his intellect. A high wire act between two perils.
            Scylla the rock and Charybdis the whirlpool. Dogma and mysticism.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 10: Wandering Rocks</h3>
            <p>The Viceroy was driving through the city. People stopped to watch the cavalcade.
            Father Conmee walked through the streets, blessing people in his mind.
            Corny Kelleher chewed a blade of hay.</p>
            <p>The city was a labyrinth. People moving in different directions, crossing paths but never really meeting.
            It was a mosaic of life.</p>
            <p>Bloom bought a book for Molly. "Sweets of Sin."
            It was trashy, but she would like it.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 11: Sirens</h3>
            <p>The Ormond Hotel. Gold and bronze. The barmaids, Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy.
            They giggled and teased the customers.
            Bloom sat in the dining room, listening to the music.</p>
            <p>Simon Dedalus sang "M'appari". His voice was beautiful.
            It made Bloom sad. He thought of love and loss.
            The music was like a siren song, pulling him in.</p>
            <p>He wrote a reply to Martha. But his mind was on other things.
            Blazes Boylan was going to see Molly. He knew it.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 12: Cyclops</h3>
            <p>In Barney Kiernan's pub, the Citizen was holding court.
            He was a fierce nationalist. He had a dog named Garryowen.
            Bloom came in to meet Martin Cunningham.</p>
            <p>The Citizen started attacking Bloom. "What about your nation?" he asked.
            "Ireland," said Bloom. "I was born here. Ireland."</p>
            <p>"And what is a nation?" asked the Citizen.
            "A nation is the same people living in the same place," said Bloom.
            The Citizen laughed. He threw a biscuit tin at Bloom.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 13: Nausicaa</h3>
            <p>Bloom sat on the rocks at Sandymount strand. It was evening.
            He watched Gerty MacDowell. She was sitting with her friends.
            She was beautiful in the twilight.</p>
            <p>Fireworks went off in the distance.
            Gerty leaned back to watch them. Bloom watched her.
            A moment of connection, silent and distant.</p>
            <p>She limped away. Bloom realized she was lame.
            He felt a pang of pity. And desire.
            He wrote in the sand: <em>I. AM. A.</em> Then he stopped.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 14: Oxen of the Sun</h3>
            <p>Bloom went to the maternity hospital to ask about Mrs. Purefoy.
            She had been in labour for three days.
            He met Stephen and his friends there. They were drinking and joking.</p>
            <p>The language of the chapter changed. From Anglo-Saxon to Middle English to modern slang.
            It mirrored the growth of the fetus in the womb.</p>
            <p>Bloom was concerned about Stephen. He was drinking too much.
            A thunderclap shook the building. The voice of God? Or just weather?</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 15: Circe</h3>
            <p>Nighttown. The red light district.
            Stephen and Bloom were there. It was a hallucination.
            Bloom saw his dead parents. He saw himself as the Lord Mayor of Dublin.</p>
            <p>Stephen saw his dead mother. She begged him to repent.
            "Non serviam!" he shouted. He smashed the chandelier with his ashplant.</p>
            <p>He ran out into the street. He got into a fight with two soldiers.
            Bloom followed him. He protected him. He saw a vision of his own dead son, Rudy.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 16: Eumaeus</h3>
            <p>Bloom helped Stephen up. They went to a cabman's shelter.
            They were tired. The keeper of the shelter, Skin-the-Goat, talked about politics.
            A sailor told tall tales about his travels.</p>
            <p>Bloom tried to talk to Stephen. He wanted to be a father figure.
            Stephen was distant. He was still drunk and exhausted.
            But he accepted Bloom's kindness.</p>
            <p>They drank bad coffee and ate a bun.
            Then they left, walking arm in arm into the night.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 17: Ithaca</h3>
            <p>They walked to Bloom's house at 7 Eccles Street.
            They entered through the kitchen. Bloom made cocoa.
            They sat and talked. About science, art, and life.</p>
            <p>They were different, but they complemented each other.
            Scientific temperament and artistic temperament.
            The water flowed. The stars shone.</p>
            <p>Stephen left. Bloom was alone again.
            He went upstairs to the bedroom.
            He lay down beside Molly. The traveller returned.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 18: Penelope</h3>
            <p>Molly was awake. She lay there thinking.
            Her thoughts flowed like a river. No punctuation. No stops.
            Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs.</p>
            <p>She thought about Boylan. She thought about her youth in Gibraltar.
            She thought about Bloom. Poldy.
            He was strange, but he was kind.</p>
            <p>And then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.</p>`
