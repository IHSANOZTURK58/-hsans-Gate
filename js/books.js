            `<h3>Page 1: The Sleeping Lion</h3>
            <p>One day, a big lion is sleeping under a tree. The sun is warm. The lion is very tired. He closes his eyes and sleeps.</p>
            <p>A little mouse runs by. The mouse does not see the lion. The mouse runs on the lion's body. The lion wakes up!</p>`,

            `<h3>Page 2: The Angry Lion</h3>
            <p>The lion is very angry. He catches the mouse with his big paw. "I will eat you!" says the lion.</p>
            <p>The mouse is very afraid. "Please don't eat me!" says the mouse. "I am very small. I can help you one day."</p>`,

            `<h3>Page 3: The Lion Laughs</h3>
            <p>The lion laughs. "You? Help me? You are too small!" But the lion is kind. He lets the mouse go.</p>
            <p>"Thank you! Thank you!" says the mouse. "I will remember this." The mouse runs away quickly.</p>`,

            `<h3>Page 4: The Trap</h3>
            <p>One week later, hunters come to the forest. They want to catch the lion. They make a big trap with ropes.</p>
            <p>The lion does not see the trap. He walks into it. The ropes catch him! The lion cannot move. He is very sad.</p>`,

            `<h3>Page 5: Help Arrives</h3>
            <p>The lion roars loudly. "ROAR! Help me! Help!" All the animals hear the lion.</p>
            <p>The little mouse hears the lion too. "That is my friend!" says the mouse. The mouse runs to the lion.</p>`,

            `<h3>Page 6: The Mouse Helps</h3>
            <p>The mouse sees the ropes. "Don't worry! I can help you!" says the mouse.</p>
            <p>The mouse uses his small teeth. He chews the ropes. Chew, chew, chew! It takes a long time, but the mouse works hard.</p>`,

            `<h3>Page 7: Freedom!</h3>
            <p>Finally, the ropes break! The lion is free! "You saved me!" says the lion. "You are small, but you are very strong!"</p>
            <p>The mouse smiles. "I told you I can help you one day!" The lion and the mouse become best friends.</p>

            `<h3>Chapter 1: The Problem</h3>
            <p>Della counted her money again. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all she had. And tomorrow was Christmas.</p>
            <p>She wanted to buy a present for her husband, Jim. But one dollar and eighty-seven cents was not enough. She sat down on the old sofa and cried.</p>
            <p>Della and Jim were very poor, but they loved each other very much. Jim worked hard every day, but his salary was small. They lived in a small apartment with old furniture.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: Della's Treasure</h3>
            <p>Della stopped crying and looked in the mirror. She had beautiful long brown hair. It reached below her knees. It was her most precious possession.</p>
            <p>Jim had one precious thing too. It was a gold watch. The watch belonged to his father and his grandfather. Jim loved his watch very much.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Della had an idea. She put on her old brown jacket and went outside quickly.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Hair Shop</h3>
            <p>Della walked to a shop. The sign said: "Madame Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." Della went inside.</p>
            <p>"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della. Madame Sofronie looked at Della's beautiful hair.</p>
            <p>"Twenty dollars," said Madame. Della's heart beat fast. Twenty dollars! That was enough!</p>
            <p>"Cut it off quickly," said Della. Soon, her beautiful long hair was gone. But Della had twenty-one dollars and eighty-seven cents.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: The Perfect Gift</h3>
            <p>Della went to many shops. She looked for the perfect gift for Jim. Then she found it! It was a platinum watch chain.</p>
            <p>The chain was simple but elegant. It was perfect for Jim's gold watch. Della paid twenty-one dollars for it.</p>
            <p>She went home with her package. She was nervous and excited. Her hair was very short now. Would Jim still think she was beautiful?</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: Jim Comes Home</h3>
            <p>At seven o'clock, Della heard Jim's steps on the stairs. She always heard Jim's steps. She said a little prayer: "Please God, make him think I am still pretty."</p>
            <p>The door opened. Jim came in and closed the door. He looked thin and cold. He needed a new coat. He looked at Della, and a strange expression came on his face.</p>
            <p>"Jim!" Della cried. "Don't look at me like that! I sold my hair to buy you a Christmas present."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: Jim's Reactions</h3>
            <p>"You cut your hair?" said Jim slowly. "Yes," said Della. "But I will always love you. My hair grows quickly, Jim!"</p>
            <p>Jim put a package on the table. "Della, no haircut could make me love you less. Open your present."</p>
            <p>Della opened the package with shaking fingers. Then she screamed with joy! Inside were beautiful combs for her hair—expensive combs that she always wanted. But now her hair was too short to use them.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: The Exchange</h3>
            <p>Della gave Jim his present. "I hope you still like it," she said.</p>
            <p>Jim smiled sadly. "Della," he said, "I sold my watch to buy your combs."</p>
            <p>They looked at each other and started to laugh. They had both given up their most precious possessions for each other.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Wisest Gift</h3>
            <p>That night, Della and Jim sat together on their old sofa. They had no expensive gifts to use. But they had something more valuable.</p>
            <p>They had their love for each other. And that was the greatest Christmas gift of all.</p>
            <p><strong>The End.</strong> The wise men who brought gifts to Jesus were called the Magi. Della and Jim were wise like the Magi because they understood that love is the greatest gift.</p>`

        pages: [
            `<h3>Chapter 1: Saturday Morning Punishment</h3>
            <p>Saturday morning came, and all the summer world was bright and fresh. Tom Sawyer appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He looked at the fence, and all happiness left him.</p>
            <p>Thirty yards of board fence, nine feet high! Life seemed hopeless to him. He began to whitewash, then sat down to think of something better to do.</p>
            <p>Jim came skipping out of the gate with a tin bucket, singing. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes before, but now it didn't seem so bad.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: A Bribe Attempt</h3>
            <p>Tom remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and Black boys and girls always waited there, resting and playing games while they waited for their turn.</p>
            <p>"Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some." Jim shook his head. "Can't, Tom. Old missus told me I got to go and get the water. She said she'd scold me if I didn't do it."</p>
            <p>"Oh, never mind what she said, Jim. She talks like that all the time. Give me the bucket—I won't be gone only a minute." But Jim was afraid of punishment.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: Ben Rogers Appears</h3>
            <p>At this dark moment, Ben Rogers came into sight. He was eating an apple and making sounds like a steamboat. As he drew near, he slowed down.</p>
            <p>"Stop the steamboat! Ding-dong-ding!" Ben pretended to be a boat captain. Tom went on whitewashing—pretended not to see Ben.</p>
            <p>"Hi-yi! You're up a stump, ain't you!" said Ben. Tom looked at him for a moment and said: "Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't noticing."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: The Psychology</h3>
            <p>"Say, I'm going in swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of course, you'd rather work—wouldn't you? Course you would!"</p>
            <p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said: "What do you call work?" "Why, ain't that work?" Ben pointed at the fence.</p>
            <p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly: "Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer."</p>
            <p>"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you like it?" "Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: The Reverse Psychology Works</h3>
            <p>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped eating his apple. Tom swept his brush back and forth, stepped back to note the effect, added a touch here and there.</p>
            <p>Ben watched every move, getting more and more interested. Presently he said: "Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."</p>
            <p>Tom considered, was about to consent, but he changed his mind: "No—no—I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's very particular about this fence."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: The Trade</h3>
            <p>"Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I'll give you the core of my apple."</p>
            <p>"Well, here— No, Ben, now don't. I'm afraid—" "I'll give you all of it!" Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but happiness in his heart.</p>
            <p>While Ben worked and sweated in the sun, Tom sat on a barrel in the shade close by, swung his legs, munched his apple, and planned how to trap more boys.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: More Victims</h3>
            <p>There was no lack of material. Boys came along every little while. They came to make fun, but stayed to whitewash.</p>
            <p>By the time Ben was tired out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite. When Billy got tired, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat on a string.</p>
            <p>And so on, hour after hour. By the middle of the afternoon, Tom had accumulated quite a treasure: twelve marbles, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, and many other valuable items.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Discovery</h3>
            <p>Tom had discovered a great law of human action: in order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to obtain.</p>
            <p>If Tom had been a great philosopher, he would have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.</p>
            <p>The fence had three coats of whitewash on it! Tom was no longer poor. He had had a nice, idle time all the while, with plenty of company, and the fence had been whitewashed.</p>
            <p><strong>The End of This Adventure.</strong> Tom had learned that work could be turned into play with the right attitude—or the right trick!</p>`

        title: "The Tell-Tale Heart",

        level: "B2",
        cover: "⚛️",
        description: "A chilling tale of guilt and madness.",
        pages: [
            `<h3>Part 1: True—Nervous</h3>
            <p>True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute.</p>
            <p>I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Observe how healthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole story.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 2: The Eye</h3>
            <p>I think it was his eye! Yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold.</p>
            <p>And so by degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.</p>
            <p>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to work!</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 3: Seven Long Nights</h3>
            <p>I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh so gently!</p>
            <p>And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head.</p>
            <p>Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 4: The Eighth Night</h3>
            <p>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph.</p>
            <p>To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea.</p>
            <p>I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out—"Who's there?"</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 5: The Heartbeat</h3>
            <p>I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle. Presently I heard a slight groan. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul.</p>
            <p>I knew it well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening the terrors that distracted me.</p>
            <p>And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 6: The Deed</h3>
            <p>In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound.</p>
            <p>This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead.</p>
            <p>I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 7: The Concealment</h3>
            <p>If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. I worked hastily, but in silence.</p>
            <p>First of all, I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings.</p>
            <p>I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 8: The Police Arrive</h3>
            <p>When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door.</p>
            <p>I went down to open it with a light heart—for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night.</p>
            <p>I smiled—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house.</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 9: The Sound Returns</h3>
            <p>At length, I led them into his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.</p>
            <p>The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears.</p>
            <p>The ringing became more distinct. I talked more fluently to get rid of the feeling, but it continued. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations. The sound increased!</p>`,

            `<h3>Part 10: The Confession</h3>
            <p>It grew louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? No, no! They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of my horror!</p>
            <p>But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer!</p>
            <p>"Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear up the planks! here, here!—It is the beating of his hideous heart!"</p>
            <p><strong>The End.</strong> The narrator's own guilt drove him to madness and confession.</p>`

        pages: [
            `<h3>Chapter 1: The Studio</h3>
            <p>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.</p>
            <p>From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs.</p>
            <p>And now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 2: The Portrait</h3>
            <p>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," Lord Henry murmured, as he examined the portrait in the brilliant sunlight. "You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor."</p>
            <p>"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," Basil Hallward answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. "No, I won't send it anywhere."</p>
            <p>Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. "Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are!"</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 3: The Secret</h3>
            <p>"Artists are always strange. They live on their nerves, like horses. But why won't you exhibit this? It is quite beautiful." "I know you will laugh at me," replied Basil, "but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."</p>
            <p>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed. "Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same."</p>
            <p>"Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 4: Dorian's Arrival</h3>
            <p>"He is all my art to me now," said the painter gravely. "I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world's history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also."</p>
            <p>"To discover the real personality of Dorian Gray is to me like a revelation. Every day I seem to understand him better. His personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style."</p>
            <p>As he was speaking, the door opened and a young man came in. His finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair seemed to have the qualities of youth itself. There was something in his face that made one trust him at once.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 5: Lord Henry's Philosophy</h3>
            <p>"You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too charming." And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case.</p>
            <p>"Youth! There is nothing like it. It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder."</p>
            <p>"As for the aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing."</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 6: The Terrible Wish</h3>
            <p>When Basil finished the portrait, Dorian looked at it for a long time. "How sad it is!" he murmured. "I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June."</p>
            <p>"If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!"</p>
            <p>"You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say." The painter stared in amazement at Dorian. He had never seen him like this before.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 7: The Transformation Begins</h3>
            <p>Days and weeks passed, and Dorian began to live the life Lord Henry had described. He became the embodiment of a new hedonism. Yet there was something tragic in it, something that seemed to fill him with a sense of terror.</p>
            <p>One day, after a particularly cruel rejection of a young actress who loved him, Dorian returned home. He noticed something strange about the portrait. Was it possible? The expression on the painted face had changed! There was a touch of cruelty in the mouth that had not been there before.</p>
            <p>With a wild sense of horror, he realized that his wish had come true. The portrait would bear the burden of his sins, while he would remain eternally young and beautiful. It was his conscience made visible—a terrible mirror of the soul.</p>`,

            `<h3>Chapter 8: The Price of Beauty</h3>
            <p>Years passed. Dorian's face remained untouched by time or vice, while the portrait grew ever more hideous. He hid it in his old schoolroom upstairs, locked behind a curtain, where no one could see the grotesque transformation.</p>
            <p>He pursued every sensation, every pleasure, every sin. The more corrupt he became, the more beautiful he appeared to the world. Society adored him. Women loved him. Men envied him.</p>
            <p>But the portrait knew

 the truth. It captured every lie, every betrayal,  every act of cruelty. The painted face aged and twisted, becoming a monstrous reflection of what Dorian truly was beneath the surface.</p>
            <p><strong>Excerpt Ends.</strong> In the complete novel, Dorian's desperate attempt to destroy the portrait—and thus his conscience—leads to his own destruction. The price of eternal youth is the loss of one's soul.</p>`

            `<h3>Episode 1: Telemachus (Opening)</h3>
            <p>Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.</p>
            <p>He held the bowl aloft and intoned: <em>Introibo ad altare Dei.</em></p>
            <p>Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: "Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!"</p>
            <p>Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.</p>`,

            `<h3>The Morning Shave</h3>
            <p>Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.</p>
            <p>Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly. "Back to barracks!" he said sternly.</p>
            <p>He added in a preacher's tone: "For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all."</p>
            <p>He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.</p>`,

            `<h3>Stephen's Thoughts</h3>
            <p>—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the current, will you?</p>
            <p>He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.</p>
            <p>—The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!</p>
            <p>He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.</p>`,

            `<h3>Interior Monologue</h3>
            <p>Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on. —My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?</p>
            <p>He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: —Will he come? The jejune jesuit!</p>
            <p>Ceasing, he began to shave with care. —Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly. —Yes, my love?</p>
            <p>—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower? Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder. —God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.</p>`,

            `<h3>The Sea and Memory</h3>
            <p>—The sea, the snotgreen sea, the scrotumtightening sea. Epi oinopa ponton. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the original. Thalatta! Thalatta! She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.</p>
            <p>Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.</p>
            <p>—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.</p>
            <p>He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's face. —The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't let me have anything to do with you.</p>
            <p>—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily. —You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you...</p>`,

            `<h3>The Key</h3>
            <p>He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the bay and, seeing the mailboat he said: —Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
            <p>He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: —Is the brother with you, Malachi? —Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons. —Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thing down there. Photo girl he calls her.</p>
            <p>Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish. Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon. —The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve. —Good, Stephen said. He turned to find the key. —Not in the pocket of my old pants?</p>
            <p>Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's wheedling voice: —When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I makes water I makes water... (God, in omnipotence you know!) So begob I do. —By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.</p>`,

            `<h3>Linguistic Complexity</h3>
            <p>Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: —So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. Begob, ma'am, says Mrs Cahill, God send you don't make them in the one pot.</p>
            <p>He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife. —That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.</p>
            <p>He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: —Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?</p>
            <p>—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely. —Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?</p>`,

            `<h3>Stream of Consciousness</h3>
            <p>—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.</p>
            <p>Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight. —Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!</p>
            <p>Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: —For old Mary Ann She doesn't care a damn. But, hising up her petticoats...</p>
            <p>He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. The doorway was darkened by an entering form. —The milk, sir! —Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.</p>
            <p><strong>Excerpt Ends.</strong> Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> revolutionized the novel through its intricate wordplay, classical allusions, and unprecedented exploration of consciousness. This opening episode establishes the complex relationship between Stephen Dedalus and Buck Mulligan, while introducing the stream-of-consciousness technique that defines the work.</p>`
