        "<h3>The Preface</h3>\n<p>The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and</p>\n<p>conceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate</p>\n<p>into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful</p>\n<p>things.</p>\n<p>The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.</p>\n<p>Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without</p>",
        "<p>being charming. This is a fault.</p>\n<p>Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the</p>\n<p>cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom</p>\n<p>beautiful things mean only beauty.</p>\n<p>There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well</p>\n<p>written, or badly written. That is all.</p>\n<p>The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing</p>",
        "<p>his own face in a glass.</p>\n<p>The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban</p>\n<p>not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of</p>\n<p>the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in</p>\n<p>the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove</p>\n<p>anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has</p>\n<p>ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable</p>",
        "<p>mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express</p>\n<p>everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an</p>\n<p>art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the</p>\n<p>point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the</p>\n<p>musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the</p>\n<p>type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the</p>\n<p>surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their</p>",
        "<p>peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.</p>\n<p>Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,</p>\n<p>complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with</p>\n<p>himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he</p>\n<p>does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that</p>\n<p>one admires it intensely.</p>\n<p>All art is quite useless.</p>",

        "<h3>Chapter I</h3>\n<p>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light</p>\n<p>summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through</p>\n<p>the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate</p>\n<p>perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.</p>\n<p>From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was</p>\n<p>lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry</p>",
        "<p>Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured</p>\n<p>blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to</p>\n<p>bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then</p>\n<p>the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long</p>\n<p>tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,</p>\n<p>producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of</p>\n<p>those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of</p>",
        "<p>an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of</p>\n<p>swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their</p>\n<p>way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous</p>\n<p>insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,</p>\n<p>seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London</p>\n<p>was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.</p>\n<p>In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the</p>",
        "<p>full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,</p>\n<p>and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist</p>\n<p>himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago</p>\n<p>caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many</p>\n<p>strange conjectures.</p>\n<p>As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so</p>\n<p>skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his</p>",
        "<p>face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and</p>\n<p>closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought</p>\n<p>to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he</p>\n<p>might awake.</p>\n<p>“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said</p>\n<p>Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the</p>\n<p>Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have</p>",
        "<p>gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been</p>\n<p>able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that</p>\n<p>I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor</p>\n<p>is really the only place.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head</p>\n<p>back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at</p>\n<p>Oxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”</p>",
        "<p>Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through</p>\n<p>the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls</p>\n<p>from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear</p>\n<p>fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You</p>\n<p>do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,</p>\n<p>you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is</p>\n<p>only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is</p>",
        "<p>not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above</p>\n<p>all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if</p>\n<p>old men are ever capable of any emotion.”</p>\n<p>“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit</p>\n<p>it. I have put too much of myself into it.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”</p>",
        "<p>“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you</p>\n<p>were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with</p>\n<p>your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young</p>\n<p>Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,</p>\n<p>my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an</p>\n<p>intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends</p>\n<p>where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode</p>",
        "<p>of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one</p>\n<p>sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something</p>\n<p>horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.</p>\n<p>How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But</p>\n<p>then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the</p>\n<p>age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,</p>\n<p>and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.</p>",
        "<p>Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but</p>\n<p>whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of</p>\n<p>that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here</p>\n<p>in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer</p>\n<p>when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter</p>\n<p>yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am</p>",
        "<p>not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to</p>\n<p>look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.</p>\n<p>There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,</p>\n<p>the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering</p>\n<p>steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.</p>\n<p>The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit</p>\n<p>at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,</p>",
        "<p>they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all</p>\n<p>should live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They</p>\n<p>neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.</p>\n<p>Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,</p>\n<p>whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer</p>\n<p>for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”</p>\n<p>“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the</p>",
        "<p>studio towards Basil Hallward.</p>\n<p>“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”</p>\n<p>“But why not?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their</p>\n<p>names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown</p>\n<p>to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life</p>\n<p>mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if</p>",
        "<p>one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I</p>\n<p>am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,</p>\n<p>I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into</p>\n<p>one’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”</p>\n<p>“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem</p>\n<p>to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it</p>\n<p>makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I</p>",
        "<p>never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.</p>\n<p>When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go</p>\n<p>down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the</p>\n<p>most serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,</p>\n<p>than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But</p>\n<p>when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish</p>\n<p>she would; but she merely laughs at me.”</p>",
        "<p>“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil</p>\n<p>Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I</p>\n<p>believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are</p>\n<p>thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary</p>\n<p>fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.</p>\n<p>Your cynicism is simply a pose.”</p>\n<p>“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”</p>",
        "<p>cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the</p>\n<p>garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that</p>\n<p>stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the</p>\n<p>polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.</p>\n<p>After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be</p>\n<p>going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your</p>\n<p>answering a question I put to you some time ago.”</p>",
        "<p>“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.</p>\n<p>“You know quite well.”</p>\n<p>“I do not, Harry.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you</p>\n<p>won’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”</p>\n<p>“I told you the real reason.”</p>\n<p>“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of</p>",
        "<p>yourself in it. Now, that is childish.”</p>\n<p>“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every</p>\n<p>portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not</p>\n<p>of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is</p>\n<p>not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on</p>\n<p>the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit</p>\n<p>this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of</p>",
        "<p>my own soul.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came</p>\n<p>over his face.</p>\n<p>“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;</p>",
        "<p>“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly</p>\n<p>believe it.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from</p>\n<p>the grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he</p>\n<p>replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,</p>\n<p>“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it</p>\n<p>is quite incredible.”</p>",
        "<p>The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy</p>\n<p>lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the</p>\n<p>languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a</p>\n<p>blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze</p>\n<p>wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart</p>\n<p>beating, and wondered what was coming.</p>\n<p>“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two</p>",
        "<p>months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor</p>\n<p>artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to</p>\n<p>remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a</p>\n<p>white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain</p>\n<p>a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room</p>\n<p>about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious</p>\n<p>academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at</p>",
        "<p>me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.</p>\n<p>When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation</p>\n<p>of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some</p>\n<p>one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to</p>\n<p>do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art</p>\n<p>itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know</p>\n<p>yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my</p>",
        "<p>own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.</p>\n<p>Then—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to</p>\n<p>tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had</p>\n<p>a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and</p>\n<p>exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was</p>\n<p>not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take</p>\n<p>no credit to myself for trying to escape.”</p>",
        "<p>“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience</p>\n<p>is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.</p>\n<p>However, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used</p>\n<p>to be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I</p>\n<p>stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,</p>\n<p>Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,</p>\n<p>pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.</p>\n<p>“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people</p>\n<p>with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and</p>\n<p>parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her</p>\n<p>once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe</p>\n<p>some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had</p>",
        "<p>been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the</p>\n<p>nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself</p>\n<p>face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely</p>\n<p>stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.</p>\n<p>It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We</p>\n<p>would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of</p>",
        "<p>that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined</p>\n<p>to know each other.”</p>\n<p>“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his</p>\n<p>companion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her</p>\n<p>guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old</p>\n<p>gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my</p>\n<p>ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to</p>",
        "<p>everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I</p>\n<p>like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests</p>\n<p>exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them</p>\n<p>entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants</p>\n<p>to know.”</p>\n<p>“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward</p>\n<p>listlessly.</p>",
        "<p>“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in</p>\n<p>opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she</p>\n<p>say about Mr. Dorian Gray?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely</p>\n<p>inseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do</p>\n<p>anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’</p>\n<p>Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”</p>",
        "<p>“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far</p>\n<p>the best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.</p>\n<p>Hallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,</p>\n<p>Harry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every</p>\n<p>one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”</p>\n<p>“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back</p>\n<p>and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of</p>",
        "<p>glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the</p>\n<p>summer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference</p>\n<p>between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my</p>\n<p>acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good</p>\n<p>intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I</p>\n<p>have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual</p>\n<p>power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of</p>",
        "<p>me? I think it is rather vain.”</p>\n<p>“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be</p>\n<p>merely an acquaintance.”</p>\n<p>“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”</p>\n<p>“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,</p>\n<p>and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”</p>",
        "<p>“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my</p>\n<p>relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand</p>\n<p>other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize</p>\n<p>with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices</p>\n<p>of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and</p>\n<p>immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of</p>",
        "<p>us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When</p>\n<p>poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite</p>\n<p>magnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the</p>\n<p>proletariat live correctly.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is</p>\n<p>more, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his</p>",
        "<p>patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are</p>\n<p>Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one</p>\n<p>puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he</p>\n<p>never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The</p>\n<p>only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it</p>\n<p>oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with</p>\n<p>the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities</p>",
        "<p>are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual</p>\n<p>will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his</p>\n<p>wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to</p>\n<p>discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons</p>\n<p>better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better</p>\n<p>than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.</p>\n<p>How often do you see him?”</p>",
        "<p>“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is</p>\n<p>absolutely necessary to me.”</p>\n<p>“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but</p>\n<p>your art.”</p>\n<p>“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes</p>\n<p>think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the</p>\n<p>world’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,</p>",
        "<p>and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.</p>\n<p>What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of</p>\n<p>Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will</p>\n<p>some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from</p>\n<p>him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much</p>\n<p>more to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am</p>\n<p>dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such</p>",
        "<p>that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,</p>\n<p>and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good</p>\n<p>work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder</p>\n<p>will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely</p>\n<p>new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things</p>\n<p>differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a</p>\n<p>way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of</p>",
        "<p>thought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray</p>\n<p>has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to</p>\n<p>me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely</p>\n<p>visible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?</p>\n<p>Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school</p>\n<p>that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the</p>\n<p>perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and</p>",
        "<p>body—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and</p>\n<p>have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.</p>\n<p>Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that</p>\n<p>landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but</p>\n<p>which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever</p>\n<p>done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray</p>\n<p>sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the</p>",
        "<p>first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had</p>\n<p>always looked for and always missed.”</p>\n<p>“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”</p>\n<p>Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After</p>\n<p>some time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply</p>\n<p>a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.</p>\n<p>He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.</p>",
        "<p>He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the</p>\n<p>curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain</p>\n<p>colours. That is all.”</p>\n<p>“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of</p>\n<p>all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never</p>\n<p>cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know</p>",
        "<p>anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my</p>\n<p>soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under</p>\n<p>their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too</p>\n<p>much of myself!”</p>\n<p>“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion</p>\n<p>is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”</p>\n<p>“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create</p>",
        "<p>beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We</p>\n<p>live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of</p>\n<p>autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I</p>\n<p>will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall</p>\n<p>never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”</p>\n<p>“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only</p>\n<p>the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very</p>",
        "<p>fond of you?”</p>\n<p>The painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered</p>\n<p>after a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.</p>\n<p>I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall</p>\n<p>be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit</p>\n<p>in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he</p>\n<p>is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me</p>",
        "<p>pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some</p>\n<p>one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of</p>\n<p>decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”</p>\n<p>“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think</p>\n<p>of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That</p>\n<p>accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate</p>",
        "<p>ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have</p>\n<p>something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and</p>\n<p>facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly</p>\n<p>well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the</p>\n<p>thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a</p>\n<p>_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above</p>\n<p>its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day</p>",
        "<p>you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little</p>\n<p>out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You</p>\n<p>will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that</p>\n<p>he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be</p>\n<p>perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will</p>\n<p>alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art</p>\n<p>one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is</p>",
        "<p>that it leaves one so unromantic.”</p>\n<p>“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change</p>\n<p>too often.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are</p>\n<p>faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who</p>\n<p>know love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty</p>",
        "<p>silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and</p>\n<p>satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was</p>\n<p>a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,</p>\n<p>and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like</p>\n<p>swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other</p>\n<p>people’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it</p>\n<p>seemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those</p>",
        "<p>were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent</p>\n<p>amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long</p>\n<p>with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure</p>\n<p>to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have</p>\n<p>been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model</p>\n<p>lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those</p>\n<p>virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.</p>",
        "<p>The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown</p>\n<p>eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped</p>\n<p>all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He</p>\n<p>turned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”</p>\n<p>“Remembered what, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”</p>\n<p>“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.</p>",
        "<p>“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told</p>\n<p>me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her</p>\n<p>in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state</p>\n<p>that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation</p>\n<p>of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very</p>\n<p>earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a</p>\n<p>creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping</p>",
        "<p>about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”</p>\n<p>“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want you to meet him.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t want me to meet him?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into</p>",
        "<p>the garden.</p>\n<p>“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.</p>\n<p>The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.</p>\n<p>“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man</p>\n<p>bowed and went up the walk.</p>\n<p>Then he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he</p>\n<p>said. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite</p>",
        "<p>right in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence</p>\n<p>him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many</p>\n<p>marvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who</p>\n<p>gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist</p>\n<p>depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and</p>\n<p>the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.</p>\n<p>“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward</p>",
        "<p>by the arm, he almost led him into the house.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter II</h3>\n<p>As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with</p>\n<p>his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s</p>\n<p>“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to</p>\n<p>learn them. They are perfectly charming.”</p>\n<p>“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of</p>",
        "<p>myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a</p>\n<p>wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint</p>\n<p>blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your</p>\n<p>pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”</p>\n<p>“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I</p>\n<p>have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you</p>\n<p>have spoiled everything.”</p>",
        "<p>“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord</p>\n<p>Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often</p>\n<p>spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am</p>\n<p>afraid, one of her victims also.”</p>\n<p>“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a</p>\n<p>funny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel</p>\n<p>with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to</p>",
        "<p>have played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what</p>\n<p>she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.</p>\n<p>And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The</p>\n<p>audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to</p>\n<p>the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”</p>\n<p>“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,</p>",
        "<p>laughing.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,</p>\n<p>with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp</p>\n<p>gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at</p>\n<p>once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s</p>\n<p>passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the</p>\n<p>world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.</p>",
        "<p>“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too</p>\n<p>charming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened</p>\n<p>his cigarette-case.</p>\n<p>The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes</p>\n<p>ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last</p>\n<p>remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,</p>\n<p>“Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it</p>",
        "<p>awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he</p>\n<p>asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky</p>\n<p>moods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell</p>\n<p>me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a</p>",
        "<p>subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly</p>\n<p>shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don’t</p>\n<p>really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your</p>\n<p>sitters to have some one to chat to.”</p>\n<p>Hallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.</p>\n<p>Dorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil,</p>",
        "<p>but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the</p>\n<p>Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon</p>\n<p>Street. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when</p>\n<p>you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”</p>\n<p>“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,</p>\n<p>too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is</p>\n<p>horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask</p>",
        "<p>him to stay. I insist upon it.”</p>\n<p>“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,</p>\n<p>gazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I</p>\n<p>am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious</p>\n<p>for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”</p>\n<p>“But what about my man at the Orleans?”</p>\n<p>The painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about</p>",
        "<p>that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,</p>\n<p>and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry</p>\n<p>says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single</p>\n<p>exception of myself.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek</p>\n<p>martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom</p>\n<p>he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a</p>",
        "<p>delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few</p>\n<p>moments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord</p>\n<p>Henry? As bad as Basil says?”</p>\n<p>“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is</p>\n<p>immoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does</p>",
        "<p>not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His</p>\n<p>virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as</p>\n<p>sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an</p>\n<p>actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is</p>\n<p>self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each</p>\n<p>of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have</p>\n<p>forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s</p>",
        "<p>self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe</p>\n<p>the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone</p>\n<p>out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,</p>\n<p>which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of</p>\n<p>religion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”</p>\n<p>“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good</p>\n<p>boy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look</p>",
        "<p>had come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.</p>\n<p>“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with</p>\n<p>that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of</p>\n<p>him, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man</p>\n<p>were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to</p>\n<p>every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I</p>\n<p>believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we</p>",
        "<p>would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the</p>\n<p>Hellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it</p>\n<p>may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The</p>\n<p>mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial</p>\n<p>that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse</p>\n<p>that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body</p>\n<p>sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of</p>",
        "<p>purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,</p>\n<p>or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is</p>\n<p>to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for</p>\n<p>the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its</p>\n<p>monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that</p>\n<p>the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the</p>\n<p>brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place</p>",
        "<p>also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your</p>\n<p>rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,</p>\n<p>thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping</p>\n<p>dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”</p>\n<p>“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what</p>\n<p>to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.</p>\n<p>Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”</p>",
        "<p>For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and</p>\n<p>eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh</p>\n<p>influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come</p>\n<p>really from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to</p>\n<p>him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in</p>\n<p>them—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,</p>\n<p>but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.</p>",
        "<p>Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But</p>\n<p>music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another</p>\n<p>chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they</p>\n<p>were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.</p>\n<p>And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able</p>\n<p>to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their</p>\n<p>own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything</p>",
        "<p>so real as words?</p>\n<p>Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.</p>\n<p>He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It</p>\n<p>seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known</p>\n<p>it?</p>\n<p>With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise</p>\n<p>psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.</p>",
        "<p>He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,</p>\n<p>and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book</p>\n<p>which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he</p>\n<p>wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.</p>\n<p>He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How</p>\n<p>fascinating the lad was!</p>\n<p>Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had</p>",
        "<p>the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes</p>\n<p>only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.</p>\n<p>“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go</p>\n<p>out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of</p>\n<p>anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And</p>\n<p>I have caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright</p>",
        "<p>look in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but</p>\n<p>he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose</p>\n<p>he has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he</p>\n<p>says.”</p>\n<p>“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the</p>\n<p>reason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”</p>\n<p>“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his</p>",
        "<p>dreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is</p>\n<p>horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,</p>\n<p>something with strawberries in it.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will</p>\n<p>tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I</p>\n<p>will join you later on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been</p>\n<p>in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my</p>",
        "<p>masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his</p>\n<p>face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their</p>\n<p>perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand</p>\n<p>upon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.</p>\n<p>“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the</p>\n<p>senses but the soul.”</p>",
        "<p>The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had</p>\n<p>tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There</p>\n<p>was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are</p>\n<p>suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some</p>\n<p>hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of</p>\n<p>life—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means</p>",
        "<p>of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think</p>\n<p>you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking</p>\n<p>the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,</p>\n<p>olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was</p>\n<p>something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His</p>\n<p>cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,</p>",
        "<p>as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.</p>\n<p>But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been</p>\n<p>left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil</p>\n<p>Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered</p>\n<p>him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to</p>\n<p>have disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be</p>\n<p>afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be</p>",
        "<p>frightened.</p>\n<p>“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought</p>\n<p>out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be</p>\n<p>quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must</p>\n<p>not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”</p>\n<p>“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on</p>\n<p>the seat at the end of the garden.</p>",
        "<p>“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing</p>\n<p>worth having.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”</p>\n<p>“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and</p>\n<p>ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion</p>",
        "<p>branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will</p>\n<p>feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it</p>\n<p>always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.</p>\n<p>Don’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher,</p>\n<p>indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great</p>\n<p>facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in</p>\n<p>dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be</p>",
        "<p>questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of</p>\n<p>those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t</p>\n<p>smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That</p>\n<p>may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,</p>\n<p>beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not</p>\n<p>judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not</p>\n<p>the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But</p>",
        "<p>what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in</p>\n<p>which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your</p>\n<p>beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there</p>\n<p>are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those</p>\n<p>mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than</p>\n<p>defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something</p>\n<p>dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your</p>",
        "<p>roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You</p>\n<p>will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.</p>\n<p>Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying</p>\n<p>to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the</p>\n<p>ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the</p>\n<p>false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!</p>\n<p>Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.</p>",
        "<p>Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants.</p>\n<p>You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing</p>\n<p>you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment</p>\n<p>I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,</p>\n<p>of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me</p>\n<p>that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how</p>\n<p>tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time</p>",
        "<p>that your youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers</p>\n<p>wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next</p>\n<p>June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the</p>\n<p>clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold</p>\n<p>its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy</p>\n<p>that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses</p>\n<p>rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the</p>",
        "<p>passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite</p>\n<p>temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!</p>\n<p>There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell</p>\n<p>from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for</p>\n<p>a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe</p>\n<p>of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in</p>",
        "<p>trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make</p>\n<p>us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we</p>\n<p>cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays</p>\n<p>sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the</p>\n<p>bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian</p>\n<p>convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and</p>\n<p>fro.</p>",
        "<p>Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made</p>\n<p>staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and</p>\n<p>smiled.</p>\n<p>“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and</p>\n<p>you can bring your drinks.”</p>\n<p>They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white</p>\n<p>butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of</p>",
        "<p>the garden a thrush began to sing.</p>\n<p>“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”</p>\n<p>“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.</p>\n<p>Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to</p>\n<p>make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only</p>",
        "<p>difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice</p>\n<p>lasts a little longer.”</p>\n<p>As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s</p>\n<p>arm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,</p>\n<p>flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and</p>\n<p>resumed his pose.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.</p>",
        "<p>The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that</p>\n<p>broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back</p>\n<p>to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that</p>\n<p>streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The</p>\n<p>heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.</p>\n<p>After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for</p>\n<p>a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,</p>",
        "<p>biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. “It is quite</p>\n<p>finished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in</p>\n<p>long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a</p>\n<p>wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “It is the</p>\n<p>finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at</p>",
        "<p>yourself.”</p>\n<p>The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.</p>\n<p>“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.</p>\n<p>“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly</p>\n<p>to-day. I am awfully obliged to you.”</p>\n<p>“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry. “Isn’t it, Mr.</p>\n<p>Gray?”</p>",
        "<p>Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture</p>\n<p>and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks</p>\n<p>flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,</p>\n<p>as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there</p>\n<p>motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to</p>\n<p>him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own</p>\n<p>beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.</p>",
        "<p>Basil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the</p>\n<p>charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed</p>\n<p>at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had</p>\n<p>come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his</p>\n<p>terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and</p>\n<p>now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full</p>\n<p>reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a</p>",
        "<p>day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and</p>\n<p>colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet</p>\n<p>would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The</p>\n<p>life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become</p>\n<p>dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.</p>\n<p>As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a</p>\n<p>knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes</p>",
        "<p>deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt</p>\n<p>as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.</p>\n<p>“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the</p>\n<p>lad’s silence, not understanding what it meant.</p>\n<p>“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t like it? It is</p>\n<p>one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you</p>\n<p>like to ask for it. I must have it.”</p>",
        "<p>“It is not my property, Harry.”</p>\n<p>“Whose property is it?”</p>\n<p>“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter.</p>\n<p>“He is a very lucky fellow.”</p>\n<p>“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon</p>\n<p>his own portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and</p>\n<p>dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be</p>",
        "<p>older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other</p>\n<p>way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was</p>\n<p>to grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is</p>\n<p>nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for</p>\n<p>that!”</p>\n<p>“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord</p>\n<p>Henry, laughing. “It would be rather hard lines on your work.”</p>",
        "<p>“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You</p>\n<p>like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a</p>\n<p>green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.”</p>\n<p>The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like</p>\n<p>that. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed</p>\n<p>and his cheeks burning.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your</p>\n<p>silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till</p>\n<p>I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses</p>\n<p>one’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your</p>\n<p>picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth</p>\n<p>is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I</p>\n<p>shall kill myself.”</p>",
        "<p>Hallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he cried,</p>\n<p>“don’t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I</p>\n<p>shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,</p>\n<p>are you?—you who are finer than any of them!”</p>\n<p>“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of</p>\n<p>the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must</p>\n<p>lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives</p>",
        "<p>something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture</p>\n<p>could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint</p>\n<p>it? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled</p>\n<p>into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the</p>\n<p>divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.</p>\n<p>“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray—that is</p>",
        "<p>all.”</p>\n<p>“It is not.”</p>\n<p>“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”</p>\n<p>“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.</p>\n<p>“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.</p>\n<p>“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between</p>\n<p>you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever</p>",
        "<p>done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will</p>\n<p>not let it come across our three lives and mar them.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid</p>\n<p>face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal</p>\n<p>painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was</p>\n<p>he doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin</p>\n<p>tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long</p>",
        "<p>palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at</p>\n<p>last. He was going to rip up the canvas.</p>\n<p>With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to</p>\n<p>Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of</p>\n<p>the studio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried. “It would be murder!”</p>\n<p>“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the painter</p>\n<p>coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. “I never thought you</p>",
        "<p>would.”</p>\n<p>“Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I</p>\n<p>feel that.”</p>\n<p>“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and</p>\n<p>sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked</p>\n<p>across the room and rang the bell for tea. “You will have tea, of</p>\n<p>course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple</p>",
        "<p>pleasures?”</p>\n<p>“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry. “They are the last refuge</p>\n<p>of the complex. But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage. What</p>\n<p>absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as</p>\n<p>a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man</p>\n<p>is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after</p>\n<p>all—though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You</p>",
        "<p>had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really</p>\n<p>want it, and I really do.”</p>\n<p>“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!”</p>\n<p>cried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me a silly boy.”</p>\n<p>“You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it</p>\n<p>existed.”</p>\n<p>“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you</p>",
        "<p>don’t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.”</p>\n<p>“I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.”</p>\n<p>There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden</p>\n<p>tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a</p>\n<p>rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.</p>\n<p>Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray</p>",
        "<p>went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to</p>\n<p>the table and examined what was under the covers.</p>\n<p>“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry. “There is sure to</p>\n<p>be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White’s, but it</p>\n<p>is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am</p>\n<p>ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent</p>\n<p>engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have</p>",
        "<p>all the surprise of candour.”</p>\n<p>“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered Hallward.</p>\n<p>“And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth</p>\n<p>century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only</p>\n<p>real colour-element left in modern life.”</p>\n<p>“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”</p>",
        "<p>“Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one</p>\n<p>in the picture?”</p>\n<p>“Before either.”</p>\n<p>“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the</p>\n<p>lad.</p>\n<p>“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t you?”</p>\n<p>“I can’t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”</p>\n<p>“I should like that awfully.”</p>\n<p>The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.</p>\n<p>“I shall stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.</p>\n<p>“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, strolling</p>\n<p>across to him. “Am I really like that?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; you are just like that.”</p>",
        "<p>“How wonderful, Basil!”</p>\n<p>“At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,”</p>\n<p>sighed Hallward. “That is something.”</p>\n<p>“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “Why,</p>\n<p>even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to</p>\n<p>do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old</p>\n<p>men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”</p>",
        "<p>“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward. “Stop and</p>\n<p>dine with me.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t, Basil.”</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”</p>\n<p>“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always</p>\n<p>breaks his own. I beg you not to go.”</p>",
        "<p>Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.</p>\n<p>“I entreat you.”</p>\n<p>The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them</p>\n<p>from the tea-table with an amused smile.</p>\n<p>“I must go, Basil,” he answered.</p>\n<p>“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on</p>\n<p>the tray. “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better</p>",
        "<p>lose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.</p>\n<p>Come to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly.”</p>\n<p>“You won’t forget?”</p>\n<p>“No, of course not,” cried Dorian.</p>\n<p>“And ... Harry!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Basil?”</p>",
        "<p>“Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.”</p>\n<p>“I have forgotten it.”</p>\n<p>“I trust you.”</p>\n<p>“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing. “Come, Mr.</p>\n<p>Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.</p>\n<p>Good-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.”</p>\n<p>As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a</p>",
        "<p>sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter III</h3>\n<p>At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon</p>\n<p>Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial</p>\n<p>if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called</p>\n<p>selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was</p>\n<p>considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His</p>\n<p>father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and</p>",
        "<p>Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a</p>\n<p>capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at</p>\n<p>Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by</p>\n<p>reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,</p>\n<p>and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his</p>\n<p>father’s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat</p>\n<p>foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months</p>",
        "<p>later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great</p>\n<p>aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town</p>\n<p>houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and</p>\n<p>took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the</p>\n<p>management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself</p>\n<p>for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of</p>\n<p>having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of</p>",
        "<p>burning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when</p>\n<p>the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them</p>\n<p>for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied</p>\n<p>him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.</p>\n<p>Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the</p>\n<p>country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but</p>\n<p>there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.</p>",
        "<p>When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough</p>\n<p>shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_. “Well,</p>\n<p>Harry,” said the old gentleman, “what brings you out so early? I</p>\n<p>thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till</p>\n<p>five.”</p>\n<p>“Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get</p>\n<p>something out of you.”</p>",
        "<p>“Money, I suppose,” said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. “Well, sit</p>\n<p>down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that</p>\n<p>money is everything.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; “and</p>\n<p>when they grow older they know it. But I don’t want money. It is only</p>\n<p>people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay</p>\n<p>mine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly</p>",
        "<p>upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor’s tradesmen, and</p>\n<p>consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not</p>\n<p>useful information, of course; useless information.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,</p>\n<p>although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in</p>\n<p>the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in</p>\n<p>now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure</p>",
        "<p>humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite</p>\n<p>enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for</p>\n<p>him.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,” said</p>\n<p>Lord Henry languidly.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?” asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy</p>\n<p>white eyebrows.</p>",
        "<p>“That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who</p>\n<p>he is. He is the last Lord Kelso’s grandson. His mother was a Devereux,</p>\n<p>Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his mother. What</p>\n<p>was she like? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in</p>\n<p>your time, so you might have known her. I am very much interested in</p>\n<p>Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him.”</p>\n<p>“Kelso’s grandson!” echoed the old gentleman. “Kelso’s grandson! ... Of</p>",
        "<p>course.... I knew his mother intimately. I believe I was at her</p>\n<p>christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret</p>\n<p>Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless</p>\n<p>young fellow—a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or</p>\n<p>something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it</p>\n<p>happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few</p>\n<p>months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said</p>",
        "<p>Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his</p>\n<p>son-in-law in public—paid him, sir, to do it, paid him—and that the</p>\n<p>fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed</p>\n<p>up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time</p>\n<p>afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she</p>\n<p>never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl</p>\n<p>died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had</p>",
        "<p>forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he</p>\n<p>must be a good-looking chap.”</p>\n<p>“He is very good-looking,” assented Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“I hope he will fall into proper hands,” continued the old man. “He</p>\n<p>should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing</p>\n<p>by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to her,</p>\n<p>through her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a</p>",
        "<p>mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I</p>\n<p>was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble</p>\n<p>who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made</p>\n<p>quite a story of it. I didn’t dare show my face at Court for a month. I</p>\n<p>hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” answered Lord Henry. “I fancy that the boy will be well</p>\n<p>off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me so. And ...</p>",
        "<p>his mother was very beautiful?”</p>\n<p>“Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,</p>\n<p>Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could</p>\n<p>understand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was</p>\n<p>mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family</p>\n<p>were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.</p>\n<p>Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed at</p>",
        "<p>him, and there wasn’t a girl in London at the time who wasn’t after</p>\n<p>him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this</p>\n<p>humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an</p>\n<p>American? Ain’t English girls good enough for him?”</p>\n<p>“It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll back English women against the world, Harry,” said Lord Fermor,</p>\n<p>striking the table with his fist.</p>",
        "<p>“The betting is on the Americans.”</p>\n<p>“They don’t last, I am told,” muttered his uncle.</p>\n<p>“A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a</p>\n<p>steeplechase. They take things flying. I don’t think Dartmoor has a</p>\n<p>chance.”</p>\n<p>“Who are her people?” grumbled the old gentleman. “Has she got any?”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry shook his head. “American girls are as clever at concealing</p>",
        "<p>their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,” he said,</p>\n<p>rising to go.</p>\n<p>“They are pork-packers, I suppose?”</p>\n<p>“I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor’s sake. I am told that</p>\n<p>pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after</p>\n<p>politics.”</p>\n<p>“Is she pretty?”</p>",
        "<p>“She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the</p>\n<p>secret of their charm.”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t these American women stay in their own country? They are</p>\n<p>always telling us that it is the paradise for women.”</p>\n<p>“It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively</p>\n<p>anxious to get out of it,” said Lord Henry. “Good-bye, Uncle George. I</p>\n<p>shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the</p>",
        "<p>information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new</p>\n<p>friends, and nothing about my old ones.”</p>\n<p>“Where are you lunching, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“At Aunt Agatha’s. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her latest</p>\n<p>_protégé_.”</p>\n<p>“Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with</p>\n<p>her charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that</p>",
        "<p>I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.”</p>\n<p>“All right, Uncle George, I’ll tell her, but it won’t have any effect.</p>\n<p>Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their</p>\n<p>distinguishing characteristic.”</p>\n<p>The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his</p>\n<p>servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and</p>\n<p>turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.</p>",
        "<p>So that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had</p>\n<p>been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a</p>\n<p>strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything</p>\n<p>for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a</p>\n<p>hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child</p>\n<p>born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to</p>\n<p>solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an</p>",
        "<p>interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it</p>\n<p>were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something</p>\n<p>tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might</p>\n<p>blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as</p>\n<p>with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat</p>\n<p>opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer</p>\n<p>rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing</p>",
        "<p>upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the</p>\n<p>bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of</p>\n<p>influence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul into</p>\n<p>some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s</p>\n<p>own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of</p>\n<p>passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though</p>\n<p>it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in</p>",
        "<p>that—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited</p>\n<p>and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and</p>\n<p>grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,</p>\n<p>whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be</p>\n<p>fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the</p>\n<p>white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for</p>\n<p>us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made</p>",
        "<p>a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to</p>\n<p>fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how</p>\n<p>interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at</p>\n<p>life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who</p>\n<p>was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim</p>\n<p>woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,</p>\n<p>Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there</p>",
        "<p>had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful</p>\n<p>things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it</p>\n<p>were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they</p>\n<p>were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose</p>\n<p>shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something</p>\n<p>like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had</p>\n<p>first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the</p>",
        "<p>coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was</p>\n<p>strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without</p>\n<p>knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful</p>\n<p>portrait. He would seek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done</p>\n<p>so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something</p>\n<p>fascinating in this son of love and death.</p>\n<p>Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had</p>",
        "<p>passed his aunt’s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.</p>\n<p>When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they</p>\n<p>had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and</p>\n<p>passed into the dining-room.</p>\n<p>“Late as usual, Harry,” cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.</p>\n<p>He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to</p>\n<p>her, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from</p>",
        "<p>the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.</p>\n<p>Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and</p>\n<p>good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample</p>\n<p>architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are</p>\n<p>described by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her sat, on</p>\n<p>her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who</p>\n<p>followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the</p>",
        "<p>best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in</p>\n<p>accordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her left was</p>\n<p>occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable</p>\n<p>charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,</p>\n<p>having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he</p>\n<p>had to say before he was thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,</p>\n<p>one of his aunt’s oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so</p>",
        "<p>dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most</p>\n<p>intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement</p>\n<p>in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely</p>\n<p>earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once</p>\n<p>himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of</p>\n<p>them ever quite escape.</p>",
        "<p>“We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,” cried the duchess,</p>\n<p>nodding pleasantly to him across the table. “Do you think he will</p>\n<p>really marry this fascinating young person?”</p>\n<p>“I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.”</p>\n<p>“How dreadful!” exclaimed Lady Agatha. “Really, some one should</p>\n<p>interfere.”</p>\n<p>“I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American</p>",
        "<p>dry-goods store,” said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.</p>\n<p>“My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.”</p>\n<p>“Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?” asked the duchess, raising</p>\n<p>her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.</p>\n<p>“American novels,” answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.</p>\n<p>The duchess looked puzzled.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind him, my dear,” whispered Lady Agatha. “He never means</p>",
        "<p>anything that he says.”</p>\n<p>“When America was discovered,” said the Radical member—and he began to</p>\n<p>give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a</p>\n<p>subject, he exhausted his listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised</p>\n<p>her privilege of interruption. “I wish to goodness it never had been</p>\n<p>discovered at all!” she exclaimed. “Really, our girls have no chance</p>\n<p>nowadays. It is most unfair.”</p>",
        "<p>“Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Erskine; “I myself would say that it had merely been detected.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,” answered the</p>\n<p>duchess vaguely. “I must confess that most of them are extremely</p>\n<p>pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris.</p>\n<p>I wish I could afford to do the same.”</p>\n<p>“They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,” chuckled Sir</p>",
        "<p>Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour’s cast-off clothes.</p>\n<p>“Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?” inquired the</p>\n<p>duchess.</p>\n<p>“They go to America,” murmured Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>Sir Thomas frowned. “I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against</p>\n<p>that great country,” he said to Lady Agatha. “I have travelled all over</p>\n<p>it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are</p>",
        "<p>extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.”</p>\n<p>“But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?” asked Mr.</p>\n<p>Erskine plaintively. “I don’t feel up to the journey.”</p>\n<p>Sir Thomas waved his hand. “Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on</p>\n<p>his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about</p>\n<p>them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are</p>\n<p>absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing</p>",
        "<p>characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I</p>\n<p>assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.”</p>\n<p>“How dreadful!” cried Lord Henry. “I can stand brute force, but brute</p>\n<p>reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It</p>\n<p>is hitting below the intellect.”</p>\n<p>“I do not understand you,” said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.</p>\n<p>“I do, Lord Henry,” murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.</p>",
        "<p>“Paradoxes are all very well in their way....” rejoined the baronet.</p>\n<p>“Was that a paradox?” asked Mr. Erskine. “I did not think so. Perhaps</p>\n<p>it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality</p>\n<p>we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we</p>\n<p>can judge them.”</p>\n<p>“Dear me!” said Lady Agatha, “how you men argue! I am sure I never can</p>\n<p>make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with</p>",
        "<p>you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the</p>\n<p>East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love</p>\n<p>his playing.”</p>\n<p>“I want him to play to me,” cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked</p>\n<p>down the table and caught a bright answering glance.</p>\n<p>“But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,” continued Lady Agatha.</p>\n<p>“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry,</p>",
        "<p>shrugging his shoulders. “I cannot sympathize with that. It is too</p>\n<p>ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid</p>\n<p>in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the</p>\n<p>colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life’s sores,</p>\n<p>the better.”</p>\n<p>“Still, the East End is a very important problem,” remarked Sir Thomas</p>\n<p>with a grave shake of the head.</p>",
        "<p>“Quite so,” answered the young lord. “It is the problem of slavery, and</p>\n<p>we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.”</p>\n<p>The politician looked at him keenly. “What change do you propose,</p>\n<p>then?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry laughed. “I don’t desire to change anything in England</p>\n<p>except the weather,” he answered. “I am quite content with philosophic</p>\n<p>contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through</p>",
        "<p>an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal</p>\n<p>to science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that</p>\n<p>they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not</p>\n<p>emotional.”</p>\n<p>“But we have such grave responsibilities,” ventured Mrs. Vandeleur</p>\n<p>timidly.</p>\n<p>“Terribly grave,” echoed Lady Agatha.</p>",
        "<p>Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. “Humanity takes itself too</p>\n<p>seriously. It is the world’s original sin. If the caveman had known how</p>\n<p>to laugh, history would have been different.”</p>\n<p>“You are really very comforting,” warbled the duchess. “I have always</p>\n<p>felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no</p>\n<p>interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look</p>\n<p>her in the face without a blush.”</p>",
        "<p>“A blush is very becoming, Duchess,” remarked Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“Only when one is young,” she answered. “When an old woman like myself</p>\n<p>blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell</p>\n<p>me how to become young again.”</p>\n<p>He thought for a moment. “Can you remember any great error that you</p>\n<p>committed in your early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across</p>\n<p>the table.</p>",
        "<p>“A great many, I fear,” she cried.</p>\n<p>“Then commit them over again,” he said gravely. “To get back one’s</p>\n<p>youth, one has merely to repeat one’s follies.”</p>\n<p>“A delightful theory!” she exclaimed. “I must put it into practice.”</p>\n<p>“A dangerous theory!” came from Sir Thomas’s tight lips. Lady Agatha</p>\n<p>shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” he continued, “that is one of the great secrets of life.</p>",
        "<p>Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and</p>\n<p>discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are</p>\n<p>one’s mistakes.”</p>\n<p>A laugh ran round the table.</p>\n<p>He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and</p>\n<p>transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent</p>\n<p>with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went</p>",
        "<p>on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and</p>\n<p>catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her</p>\n<p>wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the</p>\n<p>hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled</p>\n<p>before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge</p>\n<p>press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round</p>\n<p>her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over</p>",
        "<p>the vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary</p>\n<p>improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him,</p>\n<p>and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose</p>\n<p>temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and</p>\n<p>to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic,</p>\n<p>irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they</p>\n<p>followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him,</p>",
        "<p>but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips</p>\n<p>and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.</p>\n<p>At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room</p>\n<p>in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was</p>\n<p>waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. “How annoying!” she</p>\n<p>cried. “I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take</p>\n<p>him to some absurd meeting at Willis’s Rooms, where he is going to be</p>",
        "<p>in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn’t</p>\n<p>have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would</p>\n<p>ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are</p>\n<p>quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I don’t know</p>\n<p>what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some</p>\n<p>night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?”</p>\n<p>“For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,” said Lord Henry with a</p>",
        "<p>bow.</p>\n<p>“Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,” she cried; “so mind you</p>\n<p>come”; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the</p>\n<p>other ladies.</p>\n<p>When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking</p>\n<p>a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.</p>\n<p>“You talk books away,” he said; “why don’t you write one?”</p>",
        "<p>“I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I</p>\n<p>should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely</p>\n<p>as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in</p>\n<p>England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of</p>\n<p>all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty</p>\n<p>of literature.”</p>\n<p>“I fear you are right,” answered Mr. Erskine. “I myself used to have</p>",
        "<p>literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young</p>\n<p>friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really</p>\n<p>meant all that you said to us at lunch?”</p>\n<p>“I quite forget what I said,” smiled Lord Henry. “Was it all very bad?”</p>\n<p>“Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if</p>\n<p>anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being</p>\n<p>primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life. The</p>",
        "<p>generation into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you are</p>\n<p>tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your</p>\n<p>philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate</p>\n<p>enough to possess.”</p>\n<p>“I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It</p>\n<p>has a perfect host, and a perfect library.”</p>\n<p>“You will complete it,” answered the old gentleman with a courteous</p>",
        "<p>bow. “And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at</p>\n<p>the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.”</p>\n<p>“All of you, Mr. Erskine?”</p>\n<p>“Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English</p>\n<p>Academy of Letters.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry laughed and rose. “I am going to the park,” he cried.</p>\n<p>As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.</p>",
        "<p>“Let me come with you,” he murmured.</p>\n<p>“But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,”</p>\n<p>answered Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let</p>\n<p>me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so</p>\n<p>wonderfully as you do.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day,” said Lord Henry, smiling.</p>",
        "<p>“All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with</p>\n<p>me, if you care to.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter IV</h3>\n<p>One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious</p>\n<p>arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in Mayfair. It</p>\n<p>was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled</p>\n<p>wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling</p>\n<p>of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,</p>\n<p>long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette</p>",
        "<p>by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for</p>\n<p>Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies</p>\n<p>that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and</p>\n<p>parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small</p>\n<p>leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a</p>\n<p>summer day in London.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his</p>",
        "<p>principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was</p>\n<p>looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages</p>\n<p>of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had</p>\n<p>found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the</p>\n<p>Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going</p>\n<p>away.</p>\n<p>At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. “How late you</p>",
        "<p>are, Harry!” he murmured.</p>\n<p>“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” answered a shrill voice.</p>\n<p>He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. “I beg your pardon. I</p>\n<p>thought—”</p>\n<p>“You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me</p>\n<p>introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my</p>\n<p>husband has got seventeen of them.”</p>",
        "<p>“Not seventeen, Lady Henry?”</p>\n<p>“Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the</p>\n<p>opera.” She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her</p>\n<p>vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always</p>\n<p>looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.</p>\n<p>She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never</p>\n<p>returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look</p>",
        "<p>picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria,</p>\n<p>and she had a perfect mania for going to church.</p>\n<p>“That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner’s music better than</p>\n<p>anybody’s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other</p>\n<p>people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don’t you</p>\n<p>think so, Mr. Gray?”</p>",
        "<p>The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her</p>\n<p>fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.</p>\n<p>Dorian smiled and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so, Lady</p>\n<p>Henry. I never talk during music—at least, during good music. If one</p>\n<p>hears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it in conversation.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray? I always hear</p>\n<p>Harry’s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of</p>",
        "<p>them. But you must not think I don’t like good music. I adore it, but I</p>\n<p>am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped</p>\n<p>pianists—two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don’t know what it</p>\n<p>is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are,</p>\n<p>ain’t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after</p>\n<p>a time, don’t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to</p>\n<p>art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it? You have never been to</p>",
        "<p>any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can’t afford</p>\n<p>orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one’s rooms</p>\n<p>look so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for</p>\n<p>you, to ask you something—I forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray</p>\n<p>here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the</p>\n<p>same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been</p>\n<p>most pleasant. I am so glad I’ve seen him.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating his</p>\n<p>dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused</p>\n<p>smile. “So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old</p>\n<p>brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays</p>\n<p>people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”</p>\n<p>“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an</p>\n<p>awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. “I have promised to drive</p>",
        "<p>with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining</p>\n<p>out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury’s.”</p>\n<p>“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her</p>\n<p>as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the</p>\n<p>rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of</p>\n<p>frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the</p>\n<p>sofa.</p>",
        "<p>“Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,” he said after a</p>\n<p>few puffs.</p>\n<p>“Why, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“Because they are so sentimental.”</p>\n<p>“But I like sentimental people.”</p>\n<p>“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women,</p>\n<p>because they are curious: both are disappointed.”</p>",
        "<p>“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That</p>\n<p>is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do</p>\n<p>everything that you say.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you in love with?” asked Lord Henry after a pause.</p>\n<p>“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “That is a rather commonplace</p>\n<p>_début_.”</p>",
        "<p>“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”</p>\n<p>“Who is she?”</p>\n<p>“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”</p>\n<p>“Never heard of her.”</p>\n<p>“No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.”</p>\n<p>“My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They</p>\n<p>never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent</p>",
        "<p>the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of</p>\n<p>mind over morals.”</p>\n<p>“Harry, how can you?”</p>\n<p>“My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so</p>\n<p>I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I</p>\n<p>find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and</p>\n<p>the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a</p>",
        "<p>reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to</p>\n<p>supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake,</p>\n<p>however. They paint in order to try and look young. Our grandmothers</p>\n<p>painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. _Rouge_ and _esprit_ used</p>\n<p>to go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman can look ten</p>\n<p>years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for</p>\n<p>conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and</p>",
        "<p>two of these can’t be admitted into decent society. However, tell me</p>\n<p>about your genius. How long have you known her?”</p>\n<p>“Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind that. How long have you known her?”</p>\n<p>“About three weeks.”</p>\n<p>“And where did you come across her?”</p>\n<p>“I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.</p>",
        "<p>After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You</p>\n<p>filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days</p>\n<p>after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in</p>\n<p>the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who</p>\n<p>passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they</p>\n<p>led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There</p>\n<p>was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations....</p>",
        "<p>Well, one evening about seven o’clock, I determined to go out in search</p>\n<p>of some adventure. I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with</p>\n<p>its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as</p>\n<p>you once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied a</p>\n<p>thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I</p>\n<p>remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we</p>\n<p>first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret</p>",
        "<p>of life. I don’t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered</p>\n<p>eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black</p>\n<p>grassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little</p>\n<p>theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous</p>\n<p>Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was</p>\n<p>standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets,</p>\n<p>and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. ‘Have a</p>",
        "<p>box, my Lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an</p>\n<p>air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that</p>\n<p>amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I</p>\n<p>really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the</p>\n<p>present day I can’t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn’t—my dear</p>\n<p>Harry, if I hadn’t—I should have missed the greatest romance of my</p>\n<p>life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!”</p>",
        "<p>“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you</p>\n<p>should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the</p>\n<p>first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will</p>\n<p>always be in love with love. A _grande passion_ is the privilege of</p>\n<p>people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes</p>\n<p>of a country. Don’t be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for</p>\n<p>you. This is merely the beginning.”</p>",
        "<p>“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray angrily.</p>\n<p>“No; I think your nature so deep.”</p>\n<p>“How do you mean?”</p>\n<p>“My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really</p>\n<p>the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I</p>\n<p>call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.</p>\n<p>Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life</p>",
        "<p>of the intellect—simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must</p>\n<p>analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many</p>\n<p>things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might</p>\n<p>pick them up. But I don’t want to interrupt you. Go on with your</p>\n<p>story.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a</p>\n<p>vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the</p>",
        "<p>curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and</p>\n<p>cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were</p>\n<p>fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and</p>\n<p>there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the</p>\n<p>dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there</p>\n<p>was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”</p>\n<p>“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.”</p>",
        "<p>“Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what</p>\n<p>on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you</p>\n<p>think the play was, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“I should think ‘The Idiot Boy’, or ‘Dumb but Innocent’. Our fathers</p>\n<p>used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,</p>\n<p>the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is</p>\n<p>not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandpères ont</p>",
        "<p>toujours tort_.”</p>\n<p>“This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I</p>\n<p>must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare</p>\n<p>done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a</p>\n<p>sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There</p>\n<p>was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a</p>\n<p>cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene</p>",
        "<p>was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman,</p>\n<p>with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a</p>\n<p>beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the</p>\n<p>low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most</p>\n<p>friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the</p>\n<p>scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But</p>\n<p>Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a</p>",
        "<p>little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of</p>\n<p>dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were</p>\n<p>like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen</p>\n<p>in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that</p>\n<p>beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,</p>\n<p>Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came</p>\n<p>across me. And her voice—I never heard such a voice. It was very low at</p>",
        "<p>first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one’s</p>\n<p>ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a</p>\n<p>distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy</p>\n<p>that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There</p>\n<p>were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You</p>\n<p>know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane</p>\n<p>are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear</p>",
        "<p>them, and each of them says something different. I don’t know which to</p>\n<p>follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is</p>\n<p>everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One</p>\n<p>evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have</p>\n<p>seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from</p>\n<p>her lover’s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of</p>\n<p>Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.</p>",
        "<p>She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and</p>\n<p>given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been</p>\n<p>innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike</p>\n<p>throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary</p>\n<p>women never appeal to one’s imagination. They are limited to their</p>\n<p>century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as</p>\n<p>easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is</p>",
        "<p>no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and</p>\n<p>chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped</p>\n<p>smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an</p>\n<p>actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn’t you tell me</p>\n<p>that the only thing worth loving is an actress?”</p>\n<p>“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”</p>",
        "<p>“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary</p>\n<p>charm in them, sometimes,” said Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”</p>\n<p>“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life</p>\n<p>you will tell me everything you do.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.</p>\n<p>You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would</p>",
        "<p>come and confess it to you. You would understand me.”</p>\n<p>“People like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—don’t commit crimes,</p>\n<p>Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now</p>\n<p>tell me—reach me the matches, like a good boy—thanks—what are your</p>\n<p>actual relations with Sibyl Vane?”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.</p>\n<p>“Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!”</p>",
        "<p>“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said</p>\n<p>Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. “But why</p>\n<p>should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When</p>\n<p>one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one</p>\n<p>always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a</p>\n<p>romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”</p>\n<p>“Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the</p>",
        "<p>horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and</p>\n<p>offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was</p>\n<p>furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds</p>\n<p>of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I</p>\n<p>think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the</p>\n<p>impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.”</p>\n<p>“I am not surprised.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I</p>\n<p>never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and</p>\n<p>confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy</p>\n<p>against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.”</p>\n<p>“I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other</p>\n<p>hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all</p>\n<p>expensive.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,” laughed Dorian.</p>\n<p>“By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre,</p>\n<p>and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly</p>\n<p>recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the</p>\n<p>place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I</p>\n<p>was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though</p>\n<p>he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with</p>",
        "<p>an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ‘The</p>\n<p>Bard,’ as he insisted on calling him. He seemed to think it a</p>\n<p>distinction.”</p>\n<p>“It was a distinction, my dear Dorian—a great distinction. Most people</p>\n<p>become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of</p>\n<p>life. To have ruined one’s self over poetry is an honour. But when did</p>\n<p>you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”</p>",
        "<p>“The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going</p>\n<p>round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me—at least</p>\n<p>I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed</p>\n<p>determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not</p>\n<p>wanting to know her, wasn’t it?”</p>\n<p>“No; I don’t think so.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Harry, why?”</p>",
        "<p>“I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl.”</p>\n<p>“Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child</p>\n<p>about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her</p>\n<p>what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of</p>\n<p>her power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood</p>\n<p>grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate</p>\n<p>speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like</p>",
        "<p>children. He would insist on calling me ‘My Lord,’ so I had to assure</p>\n<p>Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She said quite simply to me,</p>\n<p>‘You look more like a prince. I must call you Prince Charming.’”</p>\n<p>“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person in</p>\n<p>a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded</p>\n<p>tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta</p>",
        "<p>dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen</p>\n<p>better days.”</p>\n<p>“I know that look. It depresses me,” murmured Lord Henry, examining his</p>\n<p>rings.</p>\n<p>“The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>“You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean about</p>",
        "<p>other people’s tragedies.”</p>\n<p>“Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came</p>\n<p>from? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and</p>\n<p>entirely divine. Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every</p>\n<p>night she is more marvellous.”</p>\n<p>“That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I</p>\n<p>thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is</p>",
        "<p>not quite what I expected.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have</p>\n<p>been to the opera with you several times,” said Dorian, opening his</p>\n<p>blue eyes in wonder.</p>\n<p>“You always come dreadfully late.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I can’t help going to see Sibyl play,” he cried, “even if it is</p>\n<p>only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think</p>",
        "<p>of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I</p>\n<p>am filled with awe.”</p>\n<p>“You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can’t you?”</p>\n<p>He shook his head. “To-night she is Imogen,” he answered, “and</p>\n<p>to-morrow night she will be Juliet.”</p>\n<p>“When is she Sibyl Vane?”</p>\n<p>“Never.”</p>",
        "<p>“I congratulate you.”</p>\n<p>“How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in one.</p>\n<p>She is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has</p>\n<p>genius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the</p>\n<p>secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to</p>\n<p>make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our</p>\n<p>laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their</p>",
        "<p>dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, Harry,</p>\n<p>how I worship her!” He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.</p>\n<p>Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was terribly excited.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different</p>\n<p>he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward’s</p>\n<p>studio! His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of</p>\n<p>scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and</p>",
        "<p>desire had come to meet it on the way.</p>\n<p>“And what do you propose to do?” said Lord Henry at last.</p>\n<p>“I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act. I</p>\n<p>have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to</p>\n<p>acknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew’s hands.</p>\n<p>She is bound to him for three years—at least for two years and eight</p>\n<p>months—from the present time. I shall have to pay him something, of</p>",
        "<p>course. When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and</p>\n<p>bring her out properly. She will make the world as mad as she has made</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>“That would be impossible, my dear boy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in</p>\n<p>her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it</p>\n<p>is personalities, not principles, that move the age.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, what night shall we go?”</p>\n<p>“Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays Juliet</p>\n<p>to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>“All right. The Bristol at eight o’clock; and I will get Basil.”</p>\n<p>“Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before the</p>\n<p>curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets</p>\n<p>Romeo.”</p>",
        "<p>“Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or</p>\n<p>reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before</p>\n<p>seven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to</p>\n<p>him?”</p>\n<p>“Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather</p>\n<p>horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful</p>\n<p>frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous</p>",
        "<p>of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit</p>\n<p>that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to him. I don’t want</p>\n<p>to see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good</p>\n<p>advice.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry smiled. “People are very fond of giving away what they need</p>\n<p>most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit</p>",
        "<p>of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered</p>\n<p>that.”</p>\n<p>“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his</p>\n<p>work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his</p>\n<p>prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I</p>\n<p>have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good</p>\n<p>artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly</p>",
        "<p>uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is</p>\n<p>the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely</p>\n<p>fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they</p>\n<p>look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets</p>\n<p>makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot</p>\n<p>write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”</p>\n<p>“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some</p>",
        "<p>perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that</p>\n<p>stood on the table. “It must be, if you say it. And now I am off.</p>\n<p>Imogen is waiting for me. Don’t forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.”</p>\n<p>As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began</p>\n<p>to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused</p>\n<p>him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by</p>",
        "<p>it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled</p>\n<p>by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of</p>\n<p>that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had</p>\n<p>begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.</p>\n<p>Human life—that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.</p>\n<p>Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as</p>\n<p>one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one</p>",
        "<p>could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous</p>\n<p>fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with</p>\n<p>monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle</p>\n<p>that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were</p>\n<p>maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to</p>\n<p>understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received!</p>\n<p>How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard</p>",
        "<p>logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect—to</p>\n<p>observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they</p>\n<p>were in unison, and at what point they were at discord—there was a</p>\n<p>delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too</p>\n<p>high a price for any sensation.</p>\n<p>He was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his</p>\n<p>brown agate eyes—that it was through certain words of his, musical</p>",
        "<p>words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned</p>\n<p>to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent</p>\n<p>the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was</p>\n<p>something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its</p>\n<p>secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were</p>\n<p>revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect</p>\n<p>of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately</p>",
        "<p>with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex</p>\n<p>personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,</p>\n<p>in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,</p>\n<p>just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.</p>\n<p>Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was</p>\n<p>yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was</p>\n<p>becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his</p>",
        "<p>beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It</p>\n<p>was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one</p>\n<p>of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be</p>\n<p>remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and</p>\n<p>whose wounds are like red roses.</p>\n<p>Soul and body, body and soul—how mysterious they were! There was</p>\n<p>animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.</p>",
        "<p>The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say</p>\n<p>where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How</p>\n<p>shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And</p>\n<p>yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!</p>\n<p>Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body</p>\n<p>really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit</p>\n<p>from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a</p>",
        "<p>mystery also.</p>\n<p>He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a</p>\n<p>science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it</p>\n<p>was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.</p>\n<p>Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to</p>\n<p>their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of</p>\n<p>warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation</p>",
        "<p>of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow</p>\n<p>and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in</p>\n<p>experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.</p>\n<p>All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same</p>\n<p>as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we</p>\n<p>would do many times, and with joy.</p>\n<p>It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by</p>",
        "<p>which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and</p>\n<p>certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to</p>\n<p>promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane</p>\n<p>was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt</p>\n<p>that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new</p>\n<p>experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex</p>\n<p>passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of</p>",
        "<p>boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,</p>\n<p>changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from</p>\n<p>sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the</p>\n<p>passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most</p>\n<p>strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we</p>\n<p>were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were</p>\n<p>experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.</p>",
        "<p>While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the</p>\n<p>door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for</p>\n<p>dinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had</p>\n<p>smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The</p>\n<p>panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a</p>\n<p>faded rose. He thought of his friend’s young fiery-coloured life and</p>\n<p>wondered how it was all going to end.</p>",
        "<p>When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a telegram</p>\n<p>lying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian</p>\n<p>Gray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl</p>\n<p>Vane.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter V</h3>\n<p>“Mother, Mother, I am so happy!” whispered the girl, burying her face</p>\n<p>in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to</p>\n<p>the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their</p>\n<p>dingy sitting-room contained. “I am so happy!” she repeated, “and you</p>\n<p>must be happy, too!”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her</p>",
        "<p>daughter’s head. “Happy!” she echoed, “I am only happy, Sibyl, when I</p>\n<p>see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr. Isaacs</p>\n<p>has been very good to us, and we owe him money.”</p>\n<p>The girl looked up and pouted. “Money, Mother?” she cried, “what does</p>\n<p>money matter? Love is more than money.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to</p>\n<p>get a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty</p>",
        "<p>pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.”</p>\n<p>“He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,”</p>\n<p>said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how we could manage without him,” answered the elder</p>\n<p>woman querulously.</p>\n<p>Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. “We don’t want him any more,</p>\n<p>Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now.” Then she paused. A rose</p>",
        "<p>shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. Quick breath parted the</p>\n<p>petals of her lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion swept</p>\n<p>over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. “I love him,” she</p>\n<p>said simply.</p>\n<p>“Foolish child! foolish child!” was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.</p>\n<p>The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the</p>\n<p>words.</p>",
        "<p>The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her</p>\n<p>eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a</p>\n<p>moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a</p>\n<p>dream had passed across them.</p>\n<p>Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at</p>\n<p>prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name</p>\n<p>of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison of</p>",
        "<p>passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had called on</p>\n<p>memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for him, and it</p>\n<p>had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her mouth. Her eyelids</p>\n<p>were warm with his breath.</p>\n<p>Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This</p>\n<p>young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against</p>\n<p>the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of</p>",
        "<p>craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.</p>\n<p>Suddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her.</p>\n<p>“Mother, Mother,” she cried, “why does he love me so much? I know why I</p>\n<p>love him. I love him because he is like what love himself should be.</p>\n<p>But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yet—why, I</p>\n<p>cannot tell—though I feel so much beneath him, I don’t feel humble. I</p>\n<p>feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love</p>",
        "<p>Prince Charming?”</p>\n<p>The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her</p>\n<p>cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed to</p>\n<p>her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. “Forgive me,</p>\n<p>Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only pains</p>\n<p>you because you loved him so much. Don’t look so sad. I am as happy</p>\n<p>to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for ever!”</p>",
        "<p>“My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides,</p>\n<p>what do you know of this young man? You don’t even know his name. The</p>\n<p>whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away</p>\n<p>to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you</p>\n<p>should have shown more consideration. However, as I said before, if he</p>\n<p>is rich ...”</p>\n<p>“Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!”</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical</p>\n<p>gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a</p>\n<p>stage-player, clasped her in her arms. At this moment, the door opened</p>\n<p>and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He was</p>\n<p>thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat</p>\n<p>clumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister. One would</p>\n<p>hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. She mentally</p>\n<p>elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She felt sure that the</p>\n<p>_tableau_ was interesting.</p>\n<p>“You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,” said the</p>\n<p>lad with a good-natured grumble.</p>\n<p>“Ah! but you don’t like being kissed, Jim,” she cried. “You are a</p>\n<p>dreadful old bear.” And she ran across the room and hugged him.</p>",
        "<p>James Vane looked into his sister’s face with tenderness. “I want you</p>\n<p>to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don’t suppose I shall ever see</p>\n<p>this horrid London again. I am sure I don’t want to.”</p>\n<p>“My son, don’t say such dreadful things,” murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up</p>\n<p>a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She</p>\n<p>felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. It would</p>\n<p>have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.</p>",
        "<p>“Why not, Mother? I mean it.”</p>\n<p>“You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a</p>\n<p>position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in the</p>\n<p>Colonies—nothing that I would call society—so when you have made your</p>\n<p>fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.”</p>\n<p>“Society!” muttered the lad. “I don’t want to know anything about that.</p>\n<p>I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I</p>",
        "<p>hate it.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Jim!” said Sibyl, laughing, “how unkind of you! But are you really</p>\n<p>going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you were</p>\n<p>going to say good-bye to some of your friends—to Tom Hardy, who gave</p>\n<p>you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking</p>\n<p>it. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. Where</p>\n<p>shall we go? Let us go to the park.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am too shabby,” he answered, frowning. “Only swell people go to the</p>\n<p>park.”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense, Jim,” she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.</p>\n<p>He hesitated for a moment. “Very well,” he said at last, “but don’t be</p>\n<p>too long dressing.” She danced out of the door. One could hear her</p>\n<p>singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead.</p>\n<p>He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to</p>",
        "<p>the still figure in the chair. “Mother, are my things ready?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Quite ready, James,” she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For</p>\n<p>some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this</p>\n<p>rough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when</p>\n<p>their eyes met. She used to wonder if he suspected anything. The</p>\n<p>silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.</p>\n<p>She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as</p>",
        "<p>they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. “I hope you will be</p>\n<p>contented, James, with your sea-faring life,” she said. “You must</p>\n<p>remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a</p>\n<p>solicitor’s office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the</p>\n<p>country often dine with the best families.”</p>\n<p>“I hate offices, and I hate clerks,” he replied. “But you are quite</p>\n<p>right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don’t</p>",
        "<p>let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her.”</p>\n<p>“James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.”</p>\n<p>“I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to</p>\n<p>talk to her. Is that right? What about that?”</p>\n<p>“You are speaking about things you don’t understand, James. In the</p>\n<p>profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying</p>\n<p>attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was</p>",
        "<p>when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at</p>\n<p>present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt</p>\n<p>that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always</p>\n<p>most polite to me. Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and</p>\n<p>the flowers he sends are lovely.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t know his name, though,” said the lad harshly.</p>\n<p>“No,” answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. “He has</p>",
        "<p>not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of him. He</p>\n<p>is probably a member of the aristocracy.”</p>\n<p>James Vane bit his lip. “Watch over Sibyl, Mother,” he cried, “watch</p>\n<p>over her.”</p>\n<p>“My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special</p>\n<p>care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why</p>\n<p>she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the</p>",
        "<p>aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a</p>\n<p>most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple.</p>\n<p>His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.”</p>\n<p>The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane</p>\n<p>with his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when</p>\n<p>the door opened and Sibyl ran in.</p>\n<p>“How serious you both are!” she cried. “What is the matter?”</p>",
        "<p>“Nothing,” he answered. “I suppose one must be serious sometimes.</p>\n<p>Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o’clock. Everything is</p>\n<p>packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.”</p>\n<p>“Good-bye, my son,” she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.</p>\n<p>She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and</p>\n<p>there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.</p>\n<p>“Kiss me, Mother,” said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched the</p>",
        "<p>withered cheek and warmed its frost.</p>\n<p>“My child! my child!” cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in</p>\n<p>search of an imaginary gallery.</p>\n<p>“Come, Sibyl,” said her brother impatiently. He hated his mother’s</p>\n<p>affectations.</p>\n<p>They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled</p>\n<p>down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the</p>",
        "<p>sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the</p>\n<p>company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl. He was like a common</p>\n<p>gardener walking with a rose.</p>\n<p>Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of</p>\n<p>some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on</p>\n<p>geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however,</p>\n<p>was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was</p>",
        "<p>trembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince Charming,</p>\n<p>and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,</p>\n<p>but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about</p>\n<p>the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life</p>\n<p>he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not</p>\n<p>to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.</p>\n<p>Oh, no! A sailor’s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a</p>",
        "<p>horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a</p>\n<p>black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long</p>\n<p>screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a</p>\n<p>polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.</p>\n<p>Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure</p>\n<p>gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it</p>\n<p>down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The</p>",
        "<p>bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with</p>\n<p>immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.</p>\n<p>They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other</p>\n<p>in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer,</p>\n<p>and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful</p>\n<p>heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase,</p>\n<p>and rescue her. Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with</p>",
        "<p>her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense</p>\n<p>house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.</p>\n<p>But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money</p>\n<p>foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much</p>\n<p>more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and</p>\n<p>to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was very</p>\n<p>good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a</p>",
        "<p>few years he would come back quite rich and happy.</p>\n<p>The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick</p>\n<p>at leaving home.</p>\n<p>Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.</p>\n<p>Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger</p>\n<p>of Sibyl’s position. This young dandy who was making love to her could</p>\n<p>mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated</p>",
        "<p>him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,</p>\n<p>and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was</p>\n<p>conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother’s nature,</p>\n<p>and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl’s happiness.</p>\n<p>Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge</p>\n<p>them; sometimes they forgive them.</p>\n<p>His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that</p>",
        "<p>he had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he</p>\n<p>had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears</p>\n<p>one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of</p>\n<p>horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a</p>\n<p>hunting-crop across his face. His brows knit together into a wedge-like</p>\n<p>furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.</p>\n<p>“You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,” cried Sibyl, “and I</p>",
        "<p>am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.”</p>\n<p>“What do you want me to say?”</p>\n<p>“Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,” she answered,</p>\n<p>smiling at him.</p>\n<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “You are more likely to forget me than I am</p>\n<p>to forget you, Sibyl.”</p>\n<p>She flushed. “What do you mean, Jim?” she asked.</p>",
        "<p>“You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me</p>\n<p>about him? He means you no good.”</p>\n<p>“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed. “You must not say anything against him. I</p>\n<p>love him.”</p>\n<p>“Why, you don’t even know his name,” answered the lad. “Who is he? I</p>\n<p>have a right to know.”</p>\n<p>“He is called Prince Charming. Don’t you like the name? Oh! you silly</p>",
        "<p>boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think</p>\n<p>him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet</p>\n<p>him—when you come back from Australia. You will like him so much.</p>\n<p>Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the</p>\n<p>theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh!</p>\n<p>how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have</p>\n<p>him sitting there! To play for his delight! I am afraid I may frighten</p>",
        "<p>the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass</p>\n<p>one’s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting ‘genius’ to his</p>\n<p>loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will</p>\n<p>announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only,</p>\n<p>Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor</p>\n<p>beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the</p>\n<p>door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting.</p>",
        "<p>They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I</p>\n<p>think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.”</p>\n<p>“He is a gentleman,” said the lad sullenly.</p>\n<p>“A prince!” she cried musically. “What more do you want?”</p>\n<p>“He wants to enslave you.”</p>\n<p>“I shudder at the thought of being free.”</p>\n<p>“I want you to beware of him.”</p>",
        "<p>“To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.”</p>\n<p>“Sibyl, you are mad about him.”</p>\n<p>She laughed and took his arm. “You dear old Jim, you talk as if you</p>\n<p>were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will</p>\n<p>know what it is. Don’t look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to</p>\n<p>think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have</p>\n<p>ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and</p>",
        "<p>difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new world,</p>\n<p>and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the</p>\n<p>smart people go by.”</p>\n<p>They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across</p>\n<p>the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust—tremulous</p>\n<p>cloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air. The brightly</p>\n<p>coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.</p>",
        "<p>She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He</p>\n<p>spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as</p>\n<p>players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not</p>\n<p>communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all</p>\n<p>the echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly she</p>\n<p>caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open</p>\n<p>carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.</p>",
        "<p>She started to her feet. “There he is!” she cried.</p>\n<p>“Who?” said Jim Vane.</p>\n<p>“Prince Charming,” she answered, looking after the victoria.</p>\n<p>He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. “Show him to me. Which</p>\n<p>is he? Point him out. I must see him!” he exclaimed; but at that moment</p>\n<p>the Duke of Berwick’s four-in-hand came between, and when it had left</p>\n<p>the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.</p>",
        "<p>“He is gone,” murmured Sibyl sadly. “I wish you had seen him.”</p>\n<p>“I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does</p>\n<p>you any wrong, I shall kill him.”</p>\n<p>She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air</p>\n<p>like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to</p>\n<p>her tittered.</p>\n<p>“Come away, Jim; come away,” she whispered. He followed her doggedly as</p>",
        "<p>she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said.</p>\n<p>When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity</p>\n<p>in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her head at</p>\n<p>him. “You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that</p>\n<p>is all. How can you say such horrible things? You don’t know what you</p>\n<p>are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you</p>\n<p>would fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said was</p>",
        "<p>wicked.”</p>\n<p>“I am sixteen,” he answered, “and I know what I am about. Mother is no</p>\n<p>help to you. She doesn’t understand how to look after you. I wish now</p>\n<p>that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck</p>\n<p>the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn’t been signed.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of those</p>\n<p>silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not going</p>",
        "<p>to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect</p>\n<p>happiness. We won’t quarrel. I know you would never harm any one I</p>\n<p>love, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Not as long as you love him, I suppose,” was the sullen answer.</p>\n<p>“I shall love him for ever!” she cried.</p>\n<p>“And he?”</p>\n<p>“For ever, too!”</p>",
        "<p>“He had better.”</p>\n<p>She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. He</p>\n<p>was merely a boy.</p>\n<p>At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to</p>\n<p>their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o’clock, and</p>\n<p>Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted</p>\n<p>that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part with her when</p>",
        "<p>their mother was not present. She would be sure to make a scene, and he</p>\n<p>detested scenes of every kind.</p>\n<p>In Sybil’s own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad’s heart,</p>\n<p>and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him,</p>\n<p>had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck,</p>\n<p>and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her</p>\n<p>with real affection. There were tears in his eyes as he went</p>",
        "<p>downstairs.</p>\n<p>His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his</p>\n<p>unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to his</p>\n<p>meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the</p>\n<p>stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of</p>\n<p>street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that</p>\n<p>was left to him.</p>",
        "<p>After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his</p>\n<p>hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been told to</p>\n<p>him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother</p>\n<p>watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A tattered lace</p>\n<p>handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he got</p>\n<p>up and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their</p>\n<p>eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him.</p>",
        "<p>“Mother, I have something to ask you,” he said. Her eyes wandered</p>\n<p>vaguely about the room. She made no answer. “Tell me the truth. I have</p>\n<p>a right to know. Were you married to my father?”</p>\n<p>She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment,</p>\n<p>the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,</p>\n<p>had come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure</p>\n<p>it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar directness of the question</p>",
        "<p>called for a direct answer. The situation had not been gradually led up</p>\n<p>to. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.</p>\n<p>“No,” she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.</p>\n<p>“My father was a scoundrel then!” cried the lad, clenching his fists.</p>\n<p>She shook her head. “I knew he was not free. We loved each other very</p>\n<p>much. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Don’t speak</p>\n<p>against him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he</p>",
        "<p>was highly connected.”</p>\n<p>An oath broke from his lips. “I don’t care for myself,” he exclaimed,</p>\n<p>“but don’t let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn’t it, who is in love</p>\n<p>with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.”</p>\n<p>For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her</p>\n<p>head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. “Sibyl has a</p>\n<p>mother,” she murmured; “I had none.”</p>",
        "<p>The lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed</p>\n<p>her. “I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,” he</p>\n<p>said, “but I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye. Don’t forget</p>\n<p>that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me</p>\n<p>that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him</p>\n<p>down, and kill him like a dog. I swear it.”</p>\n<p>The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that</p>",
        "<p>accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid</p>\n<p>to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed more freely,</p>\n<p>and for the first time for many months she really admired her son. She</p>\n<p>would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional</p>\n<p>scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers</p>\n<p>looked for. The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the</p>\n<p>bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details. It</p>",
        "<p>was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the</p>\n<p>tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away. She</p>\n<p>was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled</p>\n<p>herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now</p>\n<p>that she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase.</p>\n<p>It had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and</p>\n<p>dramatically expressed. She felt that they would all laugh at it some</p>",
        "<p>day.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VI</h3>\n<p>“I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?” said Lord Henry that</p>\n<p>evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol</p>\n<p>where dinner had been laid for three.</p>\n<p>“No, Harry,” answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing</p>\n<p>waiter. “What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don’t</p>\n<p>interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons</p>",
        "<p>worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little</p>\n<p>whitewashing.”</p>\n<p>“Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,” said Lord Henry, watching him</p>\n<p>as he spoke.</p>\n<p>Hallward started and then frowned. “Dorian engaged to be married!” he</p>\n<p>cried. “Impossible!”</p>\n<p>“It is perfectly true.”</p>",
        "<p>“To whom?”</p>\n<p>“To some little actress or other.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.”</p>\n<p>“Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear</p>\n<p>Basil.”</p>\n<p>“Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.”</p>\n<p>“Except in America,” rejoined Lord Henry languidly. “But I didn’t say</p>",
        "<p>he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great</p>\n<p>difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have</p>\n<p>no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I</p>\n<p>never was engaged.”</p>\n<p>“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be</p>\n<p>absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.”</p>\n<p>“If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is</p>",
        "<p>sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it</p>\n<p>is always from the noblest motives.”</p>\n<p>“I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don’t want to see Dorian tied to</p>\n<p>some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his</p>\n<p>intellect.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, she is better than good—she is beautiful,” murmured Lord Henry,</p>\n<p>sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. “Dorian says she is</p>",
        "<p>beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your</p>\n<p>portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal</p>\n<p>appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst</p>\n<p>others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn’t forget his</p>\n<p>appointment.”</p>\n<p>“Are you serious?”</p>\n<p>“Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever</p>",
        "<p>be more serious than I am at the present moment.”</p>\n<p>“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked the painter, walking up and</p>\n<p>down the room and biting his lip. “You can’t approve of it, possibly.</p>\n<p>It is some silly infatuation.”</p>\n<p>“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd</p>\n<p>attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air</p>\n<p>our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people</p>",
        "<p>say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a</p>\n<p>personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality</p>\n<p>selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with</p>\n<p>a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not?</p>\n<p>If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting. You know</p>\n<p>I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that</p>\n<p>it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack</p>",
        "<p>individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage</p>\n<p>makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other</p>\n<p>egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more</p>\n<p>highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the</p>\n<p>object of man’s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and</p>\n<p>whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I</p>\n<p>hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore</p>",
        "<p>her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one</p>\n<p>else. He would be a wonderful study.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don’t.</p>\n<p>If Dorian Gray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than</p>\n<p>yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry laughed. “The reason we all like to think so well of others</p>\n<p>is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer</p>",
        "<p>terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour</p>\n<p>with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to</p>\n<p>us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find</p>\n<p>good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our</p>\n<p>pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest</p>\n<p>contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but</p>\n<p>one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have</p>",
        "<p>merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly,</p>\n<p>but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I</p>\n<p>will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being</p>\n<p>fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I</p>\n<p>can.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!” said the</p>\n<p>lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and</p>",
        "<p>shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. “I have never been so</p>\n<p>happy. Of course, it is sudden—all really delightful things are. And</p>\n<p>yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my</p>\n<p>life.” He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked</p>\n<p>extraordinarily handsome.</p>\n<p>“I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,” said Hallward, “but I</p>\n<p>don’t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.</p>",
        "<p>You let Harry know.”</p>\n<p>“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in Lord</p>\n<p>Henry, putting his hand on the lad’s shoulder and smiling as he spoke.</p>\n<p>“Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and</p>\n<p>then you will tell us how it all came about.”</p>\n<p>“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian as they took their</p>\n<p>seats at the small round table. “What happened was simply this. After I</p>",
        "<p>left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that</p>\n<p>little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and</p>\n<p>went down at eight o’clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind.</p>\n<p>Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!</p>\n<p>You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy’s clothes, she</p>\n<p>was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with</p>\n<p>cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little</p>",
        "<p>green cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak</p>\n<p>lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had</p>\n<p>all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your</p>\n<p>studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round</p>\n<p>a pale rose. As for her acting—well, you shall see her to-night. She is</p>\n<p>simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I</p>\n<p>forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away</p>",
        "<p>with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the</p>\n<p>performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were</p>\n<p>sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had</p>\n<p>never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each</p>\n<p>other. I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to</p>\n<p>me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of</p>\n<p>rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white</p>",
        "<p>narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I</p>\n<p>feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it. Of</p>\n<p>course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own</p>\n<p>mother. I don’t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to</p>\n<p>be furious. I don’t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and</p>\n<p>then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take</p>\n<p>my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays? Lips</p>",
        "<p>that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.</p>\n<p>I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the</p>\n<p>mouth.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward slowly.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen her to-day?” asked Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray shook his head. “I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall</p>\n<p>find her in an orchard in Verona.”</p>",
        "<p>Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. “At what</p>\n<p>particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what</p>\n<p>did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did</p>\n<p>not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said</p>\n<p>she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is</p>\n<p>nothing to me compared with her.”</p>",
        "<p>“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry, “much more</p>\n<p>practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to</p>\n<p>say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.”</p>\n<p>Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. “Don’t, Harry. You have annoyed</p>\n<p>Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any</p>\n<p>one. His nature is too fine for that.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry looked across the table. “Dorian is never annoyed with me,”</p>",
        "<p>he answered. “I asked the question for the best reason possible, for</p>\n<p>the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any</p>\n<p>question—simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women</p>\n<p>who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except, of</p>\n<p>course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not</p>\n<p>modern.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. “You are quite incorrigible,</p>",
        "<p>Harry; but I don’t mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When</p>\n<p>you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her</p>\n<p>would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any</p>\n<p>one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want to</p>\n<p>place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman</p>\n<p>who is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at it for</p>\n<p>that. Ah! don’t mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her</p>",
        "<p>trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good. When I am with her,</p>\n<p>I regret all that you have taught me. I become different from what you</p>\n<p>have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane’s</p>\n<p>hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous,</p>\n<p>delightful theories.”</p>\n<p>“And those are ...?” asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.</p>\n<p>“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories</p>",
        "<p>about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.”</p>\n<p>“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he answered</p>\n<p>in his slow melodious voice. “But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory</p>\n<p>as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature’s test,</p>\n<p>her sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but when</p>\n<p>we are good, we are not always happy.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! but what do you mean by good?” cried Basil Hallward.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord</p>\n<p>Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the</p>\n<p>centre of the table, “what do you mean by good, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self,” he replied, touching</p>\n<p>the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.</p>\n<p>“Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One’s own</p>\n<p>life—that is the important thing. As for the lives of one’s neighbours,</p>",
        "<p>if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s moral</p>\n<p>views about them, but they are not one’s concern. Besides,</p>\n<p>individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in</p>\n<p>accepting the standard of one’s age. I consider that for any man of</p>\n<p>culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest</p>\n<p>immorality.”</p>\n<p>“But, surely, if one lives merely for one’s self, Harry, one pays a</p>",
        "<p>terrible price for doing so?” suggested the painter.</p>\n<p>“Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that</p>\n<p>the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but</p>\n<p>self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege</p>\n<p>of the rich.”</p>\n<p>“One has to pay in other ways but money.”</p>\n<p>“What sort of ways, Basil?”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the</p>\n<p>consciousness of degradation.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, mediæval art is</p>\n<p>charming, but mediæval emotions are out of date. One can use them in</p>\n<p>fiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in</p>\n<p>fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,</p>\n<p>no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever</p>",
        "<p>knows what a pleasure is.”</p>\n<p>“I know what pleasure is,” cried Dorian Gray. “It is to adore some</p>\n<p>one.”</p>\n<p>“That is certainly better than being adored,” he answered, toying with</p>\n<p>some fruits. “Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as</p>\n<p>humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us</p>\n<p>to do something for them.”</p>",
        "<p>“I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to</p>\n<p>us,” murmured the lad gravely. “They create love in our natures. They</p>\n<p>have a right to demand it back.”</p>\n<p>“That is quite true, Dorian,” cried Hallward.</p>\n<p>“Nothing is ever quite true,” said Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“This is,” interrupted Dorian. “You must admit, Harry, that women give</p>\n<p>to men the very gold of their lives.”</p>",
        "<p>“Possibly,” he sighed, “but they invariably want it back in such very</p>\n<p>small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once</p>\n<p>put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always</p>\n<p>prevent us from carrying them out.”</p>\n<p>“Harry, you are dreadful! I don’t know why I like you so much.”</p>\n<p>“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied. “Will you have some</p>\n<p>coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and</p>",
        "<p>some cigarettes. No, don’t mind the cigarettes—I have some. Basil, I</p>\n<p>can’t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette</p>\n<p>is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it</p>\n<p>leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will</p>\n<p>always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never</p>\n<p>had the courage to commit.”</p>\n<p>“What nonsense you talk, Harry!” cried the lad, taking a light from a</p>",
        "<p>fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.</p>\n<p>“Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will</p>\n<p>have a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you</p>\n<p>have never known.”</p>\n<p>“I have known everything,” said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his</p>\n<p>eyes, “but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,</p>\n<p>that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful</p>",
        "<p>girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life.</p>\n<p>Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but</p>\n<p>there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a</p>\n<p>hansom.”</p>\n<p>They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The</p>\n<p>painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He</p>\n<p>could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better</p>",
        "<p>than many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes,</p>\n<p>they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been</p>\n<p>arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in</p>\n<p>front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the</p>\n<p>past. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded</p>\n<p>flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the</p>",
        "<p>theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VII</h3>\n<p>For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat</p>\n<p>Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with</p>\n<p>an oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of</p>\n<p>pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top</p>\n<p>of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he</p>\n<p>had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry,</p>",
        "<p>upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and</p>\n<p>insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud</p>\n<p>to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a</p>\n<p>poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The</p>\n<p>heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a</p>\n<p>monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery</p>\n<p>had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.</p>",
        "<p>They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges</p>\n<p>with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in</p>\n<p>the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of</p>\n<p>the popping of corks came from the bar.</p>\n<p>“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray. “It was here I found her, and she is</p>\n<p>divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget</p>",
        "<p>everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and</p>\n<p>brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They</p>\n<p>sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to</p>\n<p>do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them,</p>\n<p>and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one’s self.”</p>\n<p>“The same flesh and blood as one’s self! Oh, I hope not!” exclaimed</p>\n<p>Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his</p>",
        "<p>opera-glass.</p>\n<p>“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,” said the painter. “I</p>\n<p>understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love</p>\n<p>must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must</p>\n<p>be fine and noble. To spiritualize one’s age—that is something worth</p>\n<p>doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without</p>\n<p>one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have</p>",
        "<p>been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and</p>\n<p>lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of</p>\n<p>all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage</p>\n<p>is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The</p>\n<p>gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been</p>\n<p>incomplete.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks, Basil,” answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. “I knew that</p>",
        "<p>you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But here</p>\n<p>is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about</p>\n<p>five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom</p>\n<p>I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is</p>\n<p>good in me.”</p>\n<p>A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of</p>\n<p>applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly</p>",
        "<p>lovely to look at—one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,</p>\n<p>that he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace</p>\n<p>and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror</p>\n<p>of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded</p>\n<p>enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to</p>\n<p>tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud.</p>\n<p>Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord</p>",
        "<p>Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, “Charming! charming!”</p>\n<p>The scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim’s</p>\n<p>dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such</p>\n<p>as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through</p>\n<p>the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a</p>\n<p>creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a</p>\n<p>plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a</p>",
        "<p>white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.</p>\n<p>Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes</p>\n<p>rested on Romeo. The few words she had to speak—</p>\n<p>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,</p>\n<p>Which mannerly devotion shows in this;</p>\n<p>For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,</p>\n<p>And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss—</p>",
        "<p>with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly</p>\n<p>artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view</p>\n<p>of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away</p>\n<p>all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious.</p>\n<p>Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them</p>\n<p>to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.</p>",
        "<p>Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of</p>\n<p>the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was</p>\n<p>nothing in her.</p>\n<p>She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be</p>\n<p>denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse</p>\n<p>as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She</p>\n<p>overemphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful passage—</p>",
        "<p>Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,</p>\n<p>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek</p>\n<p>For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night—</p>\n<p>was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been</p>\n<p>taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she</p>\n<p>leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines—</p>\n<p>Although I joy in thee,</p>",
        "<p>I have no joy of this contract to-night:</p>\n<p>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;</p>\n<p>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be</p>\n<p>Ere one can say, “It lightens.” Sweet, good-night!</p>\n<p>This bud of love by summer’s ripening breath</p>\n<p>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet—</p>\n<p>she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was</p>",
        "<p>not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely</p>\n<p>self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.</p>\n<p>Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their</p>\n<p>interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and</p>\n<p>to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the</p>\n<p>dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was</p>\n<p>the girl herself.</p>",
        "<p>When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord</p>\n<p>Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. “She is quite</p>\n<p>beautiful, Dorian,” he said, “but she can’t act. Let us go.”</p>\n<p>“I am going to see the play through,” answered the lad, in a hard</p>\n<p>bitter voice. “I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an</p>\n<p>evening, Harry. I apologize to you both.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,” interrupted</p>",
        "<p>Hallward. “We will come some other night.”</p>\n<p>“I wish she were ill,” he rejoined. “But she seems to me to be simply</p>\n<p>callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great</p>\n<p>artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more</p>\n<p>wonderful thing than art.”</p>\n<p>“They are both simply forms of imitation,” remarked Lord Henry. “But do</p>",
        "<p>let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good</p>\n<p>for one’s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don’t suppose you will</p>\n<p>want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like</p>\n<p>a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about</p>\n<p>life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.</p>\n<p>There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating—people</p>\n<p>who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.</p>",
        "<p>Good heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so tragic! The secret of</p>\n<p>remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to</p>\n<p>the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to</p>\n<p>the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?”</p>\n<p>“Go away, Harry,” cried the lad. “I want to be alone. Basil, you must</p>\n<p>go. Ah! can’t you see that my heart is breaking?” The hot tears came to</p>\n<p>his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he</p>",
        "<p>leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his</p>\n<p>voice, and the two young men passed out together.</p>\n<p>A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose</p>\n<p>on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale,</p>\n<p>and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed</p>\n<p>interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots</p>",
        "<p>and laughing. The whole thing was a _fiasco_. The last act was played</p>\n<p>to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter and some</p>\n<p>groans.</p>\n<p>As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the</p>\n<p>greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on</p>\n<p>her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a</p>\n<p>radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of</p>",
        "<p>their own.</p>\n<p>When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy</p>\n<p>came over her. “How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!” she cried.</p>\n<p>“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement. “Horribly! It was</p>\n<p>dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea</p>\n<p>what I suffered.”</p>\n<p>The girl smiled. “Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name with</p>",
        "<p>long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to</p>\n<p>the red petals of her mouth. “Dorian, you should have understood. But</p>\n<p>you understand now, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.</p>\n<p>“Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall</p>\n<p>never act well again.”</p>\n<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill</p>",
        "<p>you shouldn’t act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored.</p>\n<p>I was bored.”</p>\n<p>She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An</p>\n<p>ecstasy of happiness dominated her.</p>\n<p>“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one</p>\n<p>reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought</p>\n<p>that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.</p>",
        "<p>The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine</p>\n<p>also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me</p>\n<p>seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew</p>\n<p>nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came—oh, my beautiful</p>\n<p>love!—and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality</p>\n<p>really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the</p>\n<p>hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had</p>",
        "<p>always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that</p>\n<p>the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the</p>\n<p>orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I</p>\n<p>had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to</p>\n<p>say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is</p>\n<p>but a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My</p>\n<p>love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of</p>",
        "<p>shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do</p>\n<p>with the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not</p>\n<p>understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that</p>\n<p>I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly</p>\n<p>it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to</p>\n<p>me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love</p>\n<p>such as ours? Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we can</p>",
        "<p>be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not</p>\n<p>feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian,</p>\n<p>Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it</p>\n<p>would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me</p>\n<p>see that.”</p>\n<p>He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. “You have</p>\n<p>killed my love,” he muttered.</p>",
        "<p>She looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She came</p>\n<p>across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt</p>\n<p>down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a</p>\n<p>shudder ran through him.</p>\n<p>Then he leaped up and went to the door. “Yes,” he cried, “you have</p>\n<p>killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don’t even</p>\n<p>stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because</p>",
        "<p>you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you</p>\n<p>realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the</p>\n<p>shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and</p>\n<p>stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You</p>\n<p>are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think</p>\n<p>of you. I will never mention your name. You don’t know what you were to</p>\n<p>me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can’t bear to think of it! I wish I had</p>",
        "<p>never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How</p>\n<p>little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your</p>\n<p>art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid,</p>\n<p>magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have</p>\n<p>borne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty</p>\n<p>face.”</p>\n<p>The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and</p>",
        "<p>her voice seemed to catch in her throat. “You are not serious, Dorian?”</p>\n<p>she murmured. “You are acting.”</p>\n<p>“Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,” he answered bitterly.</p>\n<p>She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her</p>\n<p>face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm and</p>\n<p>looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. “Don’t touch me!” he cried.</p>\n<p>A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay</p>",
        "<p>there like a trampled flower. “Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she</p>\n<p>whispered. “I am so sorry I didn’t act well. I was thinking of you all</p>\n<p>the time. But I will try—indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across</p>\n<p>me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had</p>\n<p>not kissed me—if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.</p>\n<p>Don’t go away from me. I couldn’t bear it. Oh! don’t go away from me.</p>\n<p>My brother ... No; never mind. He didn’t mean it. He was in jest....</p>",
        "<p>But you, oh! can’t you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard and</p>\n<p>try to improve. Don’t be cruel to me, because I love you better than</p>\n<p>anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not</p>\n<p>pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown</p>\n<p>myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn’t help</p>\n<p>it. Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me.” A fit of passionate sobbing</p>\n<p>choked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian</p>",
        "<p>Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled</p>\n<p>lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous</p>\n<p>about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane</p>\n<p>seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>“I am going,” he said at last in his calm clear voice. “I don’t wish to</p>\n<p>be unkind, but I can’t see you again. You have disappointed me.”</p>",
        "<p>She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little</p>\n<p>hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He</p>\n<p>turned on his heel and left the room. In a few moments he was out of</p>\n<p>the theatre.</p>\n<p>Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly</p>\n<p>lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking</p>\n<p>houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after</p>",
        "<p>him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like</p>\n<p>monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps,</p>\n<p>and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.</p>\n<p>As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.</p>\n<p>The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed</p>\n<p>itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies</p>\n<p>rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with</p>",
        "<p>the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an</p>\n<p>anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men</p>\n<p>unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some</p>\n<p>cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money</p>\n<p>for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at</p>\n<p>midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long</p>\n<p>line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red</p>",
        "<p>roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,</p>\n<p>jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey,</p>\n<p>sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,</p>\n<p>waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging</p>\n<p>doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped</p>\n<p>and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.</p>\n<p>Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked</p>",
        "<p>and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.</p>\n<p>After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few</p>\n<p>moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent</p>\n<p>square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.</p>\n<p>The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like</p>\n<p>silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke</p>\n<p>was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.</p>",
        "<p>In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge’s barge, that</p>\n<p>hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,</p>\n<p>lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals</p>\n<p>of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out and,</p>\n<p>having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library</p>\n<p>towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the</p>\n<p>ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had</p>",
        "<p>decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries</p>\n<p>that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As</p>\n<p>he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait</p>\n<p>Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise.</p>\n<p>Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he</p>\n<p>had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.</p>\n<p>Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In</p>",
        "<p>the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk</p>\n<p>blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression</p>\n<p>looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty</p>\n<p>in the mouth. It was certainly strange.</p>\n<p>He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The</p>\n<p>bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky</p>\n<p>corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he</p>",
        "<p>had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be</p>\n<p>more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the</p>\n<p>lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking</p>\n<p>into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.</p>\n<p>He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory</p>\n<p>Cupids, one of Lord Henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly</p>\n<p>into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What</p>",
        "<p>did it mean?</p>\n<p>He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it</p>\n<p>again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual</p>\n<p>painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had</p>\n<p>altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly</p>\n<p>apparent.</p>\n<p>He threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there</p>",
        "<p>flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio the</p>\n<p>day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He</p>\n<p>had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the</p>\n<p>portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the</p>\n<p>face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that</p>\n<p>the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and</p>\n<p>thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness</p>",
        "<p>of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been</p>\n<p>fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to</p>\n<p>think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the</p>\n<p>touch of cruelty in the mouth.</p>\n<p>Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl’s fault, not his. He had</p>\n<p>dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he</p>\n<p>had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been</p>",
        "<p>shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over</p>\n<p>him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little</p>\n<p>child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had</p>\n<p>he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he</p>\n<p>had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had</p>\n<p>lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His</p>\n<p>life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had</p>",
        "<p>wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear</p>\n<p>sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of</p>\n<p>their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one</p>\n<p>with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and</p>\n<p>Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl</p>\n<p>Vane? She was nothing to him now.</p>\n<p>But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his</p>",
        "<p>life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty.</p>\n<p>Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it</p>\n<p>again?</p>\n<p>No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The</p>\n<p>horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly</p>\n<p>there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men</p>\n<p>mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.</p>",
        "<p>Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel</p>\n<p>smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met</p>\n<p>his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted</p>\n<p>image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would</p>\n<p>alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses</p>\n<p>would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and</p>\n<p>wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or</p>",
        "<p>unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would</p>\n<p>resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more—would not, at</p>\n<p>any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil</p>\n<p>Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for</p>\n<p>impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,</p>\n<p>marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She</p>\n<p>must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish</p>",
        "<p>and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would</p>\n<p>return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be</p>\n<p>beautiful and pure.</p>\n<p>He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the</p>\n<p>portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. “How horrible!” he murmured</p>\n<p>to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he</p>\n<p>stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning</p>",
        "<p>air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of</p>\n<p>Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name</p>\n<p>over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched</p>\n<p>garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>\n<p>It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times</p>\n<p>on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered</p>\n<p>what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and</p>\n<p>Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a</p>\n<p>small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains,</p>\n<p>with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall</p>",
        "<p>windows.</p>\n<p>“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling.</p>\n<p>“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray drowsily.</p>\n<p>“One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.”</p>\n<p>How late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his</p>\n<p>letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand</p>\n<p>that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The</p>",
        "<p>others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of</p>\n<p>cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of</p>\n<p>charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young</p>\n<p>men every morning during the season. There was a rather heavy bill for</p>\n<p>a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the</p>\n<p>courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned</p>\n<p>people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary</p>",
        "<p>things are our only necessities; and there were several very</p>\n<p>courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders</p>\n<p>offering to advance any sum of money at a moment’s notice and at the</p>\n<p>most reasonable rates of interest.</p>\n<p>After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate</p>\n<p>dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the</p>\n<p>onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.</p>",
        "<p>He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense</p>\n<p>of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice,</p>\n<p>but there was the unreality of a dream about it.</p>\n<p>As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a</p>\n<p>light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round</p>\n<p>table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air</p>\n<p>seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the</p>",
        "<p>blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before</p>\n<p>him. He felt perfectly happy.</p>\n<p>Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the</p>\n<p>portrait, and he started.</p>\n<p>“Too cold for Monsieur?” asked his valet, putting an omelette on the</p>\n<p>table. “I shut the window?”</p>\n<p>Dorian shook his head. “I am not cold,” he murmured.</p>",
        "<p>Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply</p>\n<p>his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there</p>\n<p>had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The</p>\n<p>thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It</p>\n<p>would make him smile.</p>\n<p>And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in</p>\n<p>the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of</p>",
        "<p>cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the</p>\n<p>room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the</p>\n<p>portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes</p>\n<p>had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to</p>\n<p>tell him to remain. As the door was closing behind him, he called him</p>\n<p>back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a</p>\n<p>moment. “I am not at home to any one, Victor,” he said with a sigh. The</p>",
        "<p>man bowed and retired.</p>\n<p>Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on</p>\n<p>a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen</p>\n<p>was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a</p>\n<p>rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously,</p>\n<p>wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man’s life.</p>\n<p>Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was</p>",
        "<p>the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was</p>\n<p>not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier</p>\n<p>chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?</p>\n<p>What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own</p>\n<p>picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be</p>\n<p>examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful</p>\n<p>state of doubt.</p>",
        "<p>He got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he</p>\n<p>looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside and</p>\n<p>saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had</p>\n<p>altered.</p>\n<p>As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he</p>\n<p>found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost</p>\n<p>scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was</p>",
        "<p>incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle</p>\n<p>affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form</p>\n<p>and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him? Could it be</p>\n<p>that what that soul thought, they realized?—that what it dreamed, they</p>\n<p>made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered,</p>\n<p>and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the</p>\n<p>picture in sickened horror.</p>",
        "<p>One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him</p>\n<p>conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not</p>\n<p>too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His</p>\n<p>unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be</p>\n<p>transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil</p>\n<p>Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would</p>\n<p>be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the</p>",
        "<p>fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could</p>\n<p>lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the</p>\n<p>degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men</p>\n<p>brought upon their souls.</p>\n<p>Three o’clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double</p>\n<p>chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the</p>\n<p>scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his</p>",
        "<p>way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was</p>\n<p>wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he</p>\n<p>went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had</p>\n<p>loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He</p>\n<p>covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of</p>\n<p>pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we</p>\n<p>feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,</p>",
        "<p>not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the</p>\n<p>letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.</p>\n<p>Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s</p>\n<p>voice outside. “My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can’t</p>\n<p>bear your shutting yourself up like this.”</p>\n<p>He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking</p>\n<p>still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry</p>",
        "<p>in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel</p>\n<p>with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was</p>\n<p>inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,</p>\n<p>and unlocked the door.</p>\n<p>“I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,” said Lord Henry as he entered. “But</p>\n<p>you must not think too much about it.”</p>\n<p>“Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked the lad.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly</p>\n<p>pulling off his yellow gloves. “It is dreadful, from one point of view,</p>\n<p>but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her,</p>\n<p>after the play was over?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?”</p>\n<p>“I was brutal, Harry—perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am</p>",
        "<p>not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know</p>\n<p>myself better.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would</p>\n<p>find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.”</p>\n<p>“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head and</p>\n<p>smiling. “I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin</p>\n<p>with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in</p>",
        "<p>us. Don’t sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not before me. I want</p>\n<p>to be good. I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.”</p>\n<p>“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you</p>\n<p>on it. But how are you going to begin?”</p>\n<p>“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”</p>\n<p>“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him</p>\n<p>in perplexed amazement. “But, my dear Dorian—”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about</p>\n<p>marriage. Don’t say it. Don’t ever say things of that kind to me again.</p>\n<p>Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word</p>\n<p>to her. She is to be my wife.”</p>\n<p>“Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn’t you get my letter? I wrote to you this</p>\n<p>morning, and sent the note down by my own man.”</p>\n<p>“Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was</p>",
        "<p>afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn’t like. You cut</p>\n<p>life to pieces with your epigrams.”</p>\n<p>“You know nothing then?”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,</p>\n<p>took both his hands in his own and held them tightly. “Dorian,” he</p>\n<p>said, “my letter—don’t be frightened—was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is</p>",
        "<p>dead.”</p>\n<p>A cry of pain broke from the lad’s lips, and he leaped to his feet,</p>\n<p>tearing his hands away from Lord Henry’s grasp. “Dead! Sibyl dead! It</p>\n<p>is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?”</p>\n<p>“It is quite true, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, gravely. “It is in all the</p>\n<p>morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till</p>\n<p>I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not</p>",
        "<p>be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.</p>\n<p>But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make</p>\n<p>one’s _début_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an</p>\n<p>interest to one’s old age. I suppose they don’t know your name at the</p>\n<p>theatre? If they don’t, it is all right. Did any one see you going</p>\n<p>round to her room? That is an important point.”</p>\n<p>Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror.</p>",
        "<p>Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, “Harry, did you say an</p>\n<p>inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl—? Oh, Harry, I can’t bear</p>\n<p>it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.”</p>\n<p>“I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put</p>\n<p>in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre</p>\n<p>with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had</p>\n<p>forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she</p>",
        "<p>did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the</p>\n<p>floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake,</p>\n<p>some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don’t know what it was, but</p>\n<p>it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was</p>\n<p>prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.”</p>\n<p>“Harry, Harry, it is terrible!” cried the lad.</p>\n<p>“Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed</p>",
        "<p>up in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have</p>\n<p>thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and</p>\n<p>seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn’t let this</p>\n<p>thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and</p>\n<p>afterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and</p>\n<p>everybody will be there. You can come to my sister’s box. She has got</p>\n<p>some smart women with her.”</p>",
        "<p>“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” said Dorian Gray, half to himself,</p>\n<p>“murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.</p>\n<p>Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as</p>\n<p>happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go</p>\n<p>on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How</p>\n<p>extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,</p>\n<p>Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has</p>",
        "<p>happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.</p>\n<p>Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my</p>\n<p>life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been</p>\n<p>addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent</p>\n<p>people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh,</p>\n<p>Harry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was</p>\n<p>everything to me. Then came that dreadful night—was it really only last</p>",
        "<p>night?—when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She</p>\n<p>explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a</p>\n<p>bit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me</p>\n<p>afraid. I can’t tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I</p>\n<p>would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My</p>\n<p>God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don’t know the danger I am in,</p>\n<p>and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for</p>",
        "<p>me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case</p>\n<p>and producing a gold-latten matchbox, “the only way a woman can ever</p>\n<p>reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible</p>\n<p>interest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been</p>\n<p>wretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly. One can always</p>\n<p>be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon</p>",
        "<p>found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman</p>\n<p>finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy,</p>\n<p>or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to pay</p>\n<p>for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been</p>\n<p>abject—which, of course, I would not have allowed—but I assure you that</p>\n<p>in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the room</p>",
        "<p>and looking horribly pale. “But I thought it was my duty. It is not my</p>\n<p>fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.</p>\n<p>I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good</p>\n<p>resolutions—that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.”</p>\n<p>“Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific</p>\n<p>laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely _nil_.</p>\n<p>They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions</p>",
        "<p>that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said</p>\n<p>for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they</p>\n<p>have no account.”</p>\n<p>“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,</p>\n<p>“why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I</p>\n<p>don’t think I am heartless. Do you?”</p>\n<p>“You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be</p>",
        "<p>entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry with</p>\n<p>his sweet melancholy smile.</p>\n<p>The lad frowned. “I don’t like that explanation, Harry,” he rejoined,</p>\n<p>“but I am glad you don’t think I am heartless. I am nothing of the</p>\n<p>kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has</p>\n<p>happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply</p>\n<p>like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible</p>",
        "<p>beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but</p>\n<p>by which I have not been wounded.”</p>\n<p>“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an</p>\n<p>exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism, “an</p>\n<p>extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is</p>\n<p>this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an</p>\n<p>inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their</p>",
        "<p>absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack</p>\n<p>of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an</p>\n<p>impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes,</p>\n<p>however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses</p>\n<p>our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply</p>\n<p>appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are</p>\n<p>no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are</p>",
        "<p>both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle</p>\n<p>enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened?</p>\n<p>Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had</p>\n<p>such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the</p>\n<p>rest of my life. The people who have adored me—there have not been very</p>\n<p>many, but there have been some—have always insisted on living on, long</p>\n<p>after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have</p>",
        "<p>become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for</p>\n<p>reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is!</p>\n<p>And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb</p>\n<p>the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details</p>\n<p>are always vulgar.”</p>\n<p>“I must sow poppies in my garden,” sighed Dorian.</p>\n<p>“There is no necessity,” rejoined his companion. “Life has always</p>",
        "<p>poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once</p>\n<p>wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic</p>\n<p>mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did</p>\n<p>die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice</p>\n<p>the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one</p>\n<p>with the terror of eternity. Well—would you believe it?—a week ago, at</p>\n<p>Lady Hampshire’s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in</p>",
        "<p>question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and</p>\n<p>digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance</p>\n<p>in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again and assured me that I</p>\n<p>had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous</p>\n<p>dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she</p>\n<p>showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women</p>\n<p>never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act,</p>",
        "<p>and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose</p>\n<p>to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would</p>\n<p>have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.</p>\n<p>They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are</p>\n<p>more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the</p>\n<p>women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.</p>\n<p>Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going</p>",
        "<p>in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve,</p>\n<p>whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of</p>\n<p>pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a</p>\n<p>great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their</p>\n<p>husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it</p>\n<p>were the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its</p>\n<p>mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and</p>",
        "<p>I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being</p>\n<p>told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes;</p>\n<p>there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern</p>\n<p>life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.”</p>\n<p>“What is that, Harry?” said the lad listlessly.</p>\n<p>“Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else’s admirer when one</p>\n<p>loses one’s own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But</p>",
        "<p>really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the</p>\n<p>women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her</p>\n<p>death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.</p>\n<p>They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with,</p>\n<p>such as romance, passion, and love.”</p>\n<p>“I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.”</p>\n<p>“I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more</p>",
        "<p>than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have</p>\n<p>emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all</p>\n<p>the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I</p>\n<p>have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how</p>\n<p>delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day</p>\n<p>before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful,</p>\n<p>but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to</p>",
        "<p>everything.”</p>\n<p>“What was that, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of</p>\n<p>romance—that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that</p>\n<p>if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.”</p>\n<p>“She will never come to life again now,” muttered the lad, burying his</p>\n<p>face in his hands.</p>",
        "<p>“No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you</p>\n<p>must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a</p>\n<p>strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene</p>\n<p>from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived,</p>\n<p>and so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a</p>\n<p>dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare’s plays and left them</p>\n<p>lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare’s music</p>",
        "<p>sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual</p>\n<p>life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn</p>\n<p>for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was</p>\n<p>strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio</p>\n<p>died. But don’t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real</p>\n<p>than they are.”</p>\n<p>There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and</p>",
        "<p>with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colours</p>\n<p>faded wearily out of things.</p>\n<p>After some time Dorian Gray looked up. “You have explained me to</p>\n<p>myself, Harry,” he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. “I felt</p>\n<p>all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not</p>\n<p>express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again</p>\n<p>of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all.</p>",
        "<p>I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.”</p>\n<p>“Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that</p>\n<p>you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.”</p>\n<p>“But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What</p>\n<p>then?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, then,” said Lord Henry, rising to go, “then, my dear Dorian, you</p>\n<p>would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to</p>",
        "<p>you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads</p>\n<p>too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We</p>\n<p>cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the</p>\n<p>club. We are rather late, as it is.”</p>\n<p>“I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat</p>\n<p>anything. What is the number of your sister’s box?”</p>\n<p>“Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her</p>",
        "<p>name on the door. But I am sorry you won’t come and dine.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel up to it,” said Dorian listlessly. “But I am awfully</p>\n<p>obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my</p>\n<p>best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.”</p>\n<p>“We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,” answered Lord</p>\n<p>Henry, shaking him by the hand. “Good-bye. I shall see you before</p>\n<p>nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.”</p>",
        "<p>As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in</p>\n<p>a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.</p>\n<p>He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an</p>\n<p>interminable time over everything.</p>\n<p>As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back. No;</p>\n<p>there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of</p>\n<p>Sibyl Vane’s death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious</p>",
        "<p>of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred</p>\n<p>the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment</p>\n<p>that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it</p>\n<p>indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed</p>\n<p>within the soul? He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the</p>\n<p>change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.</p>\n<p>Poor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked</p>",
        "<p>death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her and taken her</p>\n<p>with him. How had she played that dreadful last scene? Had she cursed</p>\n<p>him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would</p>\n<p>always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything by the</p>\n<p>sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what</p>\n<p>she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.</p>\n<p>When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent</p>",
        "<p>on to the world’s stage to show the supreme reality of love. A</p>\n<p>wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her</p>\n<p>childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace. He</p>\n<p>brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture.</p>\n<p>He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his</p>\n<p>choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him—life, and</p>\n<p>his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion,</p>",
        "<p>pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins—he was to have</p>\n<p>all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame:</p>\n<p>that was all.</p>\n<p>A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that</p>\n<p>was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery</p>\n<p>of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips</p>\n<p>that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat</p>",
        "<p>before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as</p>\n<p>it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which</p>\n<p>he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be</p>\n<p>hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had</p>\n<p>so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The</p>\n<p>pity of it! the pity of it!</p>\n<p>For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that</p>",
        "<p>existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in</p>\n<p>answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain</p>\n<p>unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender</p>\n<p>the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance</p>\n<p>might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?</p>\n<p>Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer</p>\n<p>that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious</p>",
        "<p>scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence</p>\n<p>upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon</p>\n<p>dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,</p>\n<p>might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods</p>\n<p>and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?</p>\n<p>But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a</p>\n<p>prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to</p>",
        "<p>alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?</p>\n<p>For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to</p>\n<p>follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him</p>\n<p>the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so</p>\n<p>it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he</p>\n<p>would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.</p>\n<p>When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of</p>",
        "<p>chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one</p>\n<p>blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life</p>\n<p>would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and</p>\n<p>fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured</p>\n<p>image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.</p>\n<p>He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,</p>\n<p>smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was</p>",
        "<p>already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord</p>\n<p>Henry was leaning over his chair.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter IX</h3>\n<p>As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown</p>\n<p>into the room.</p>\n<p>“I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,” he said gravely. “I called</p>\n<p>last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew</p>\n<p>that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really</p>\n<p>gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy</p>",
        "<p>might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me</p>\n<p>when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late</p>\n<p>edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club. I came here at</p>\n<p>once and was miserable at not finding you. I can’t tell you how</p>\n<p>heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.</p>\n<p>But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl’s mother? For a</p>\n<p>moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the</p>",
        "<p>paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn’t it? But I was afraid of</p>\n<p>intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a</p>\n<p>state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about</p>\n<p>it all?”</p>\n<p>“My dear Basil, how do I know?” murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some</p>\n<p>pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass</p>\n<p>and looking dreadfully bored. “I was at the opera. You should have come</p>",
        "<p>on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry’s sister, for the first time. We</p>\n<p>were in her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.</p>\n<p>Don’t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn’t talk about a thing, it</p>\n<p>has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives</p>\n<p>reality to things. I may mention that she was not the woman’s only</p>\n<p>child. There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But he is not on</p>\n<p>the stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell me about</p>",
        "<p>yourself and what you are painting.”</p>\n<p>“You went to the opera?” said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a</p>\n<p>strained touch of pain in his voice. “You went to the opera while Sibyl</p>\n<p>Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other</p>\n<p>women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl</p>\n<p>you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there</p>\n<p>are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!”</p>",
        "<p>“Stop, Basil! I won’t hear it!” cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. “You</p>\n<p>must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is</p>\n<p>past.”</p>\n<p>“You call yesterday the past?”</p>\n<p>“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only</p>\n<p>shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is</p>\n<p>master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a</p>",
        "<p>pleasure. I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use</p>\n<p>them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”</p>\n<p>“Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You</p>\n<p>look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come</p>\n<p>down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural,</p>\n<p>and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the</p>\n<p>whole world. Now, I don’t know what has come over you. You talk as if</p>",
        "<p>you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry’s influence. I see</p>\n<p>that.”</p>\n<p>The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few</p>\n<p>moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. “I owe a great</p>\n<p>deal to Harry, Basil,” he said at last, “more than I owe to you. You</p>\n<p>only taught me to be vain.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I am punished for that, Dorian—or shall be some day.”</p>",
        "<p>“I don’t know what you mean, Basil,” he exclaimed, turning round. “I</p>\n<p>don’t know what you want. What do you want?”</p>\n<p>“I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,” said the artist sadly.</p>\n<p>“Basil,” said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his</p>\n<p>shoulder, “you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl</p>\n<p>Vane had killed herself—”</p>\n<p>“Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?” cried</p>",
        "<p>Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.</p>\n<p>“My dear Basil! Surely you don’t think it was a vulgar accident? Of</p>\n<p>course she killed herself.”</p>\n<p>The elder man buried his face in his hands. “How fearful,” he muttered,</p>\n<p>and a shudder ran through him.</p>\n<p>“No,” said Dorian Gray, “there is nothing fearful about it. It is one</p>\n<p>of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act</p>",
        "<p>lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful</p>\n<p>wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean—middle-class virtue</p>\n<p>and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her</p>\n<p>finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played—the</p>\n<p>night you saw her—she acted badly because she had known the reality of</p>\n<p>love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.</p>\n<p>She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the</p>",
        "<p>martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of</p>\n<p>martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not</p>\n<p>think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular</p>\n<p>moment—about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six—you would</p>\n<p>have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the</p>\n<p>news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered</p>\n<p>immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can,</p>",
        "<p>except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come</p>\n<p>down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled,</p>\n<p>and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a</p>\n<p>story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty</p>\n<p>years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some</p>\n<p>unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded,</p>\n<p>and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing</p>",
        "<p>to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And</p>\n<p>besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me</p>\n<p>rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic</p>\n<p>point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la</p>\n<p>consolation des arts_? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered</p>\n<p>book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.</p>\n<p>Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at</p>",
        "<p>Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could</p>\n<p>console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that</p>\n<p>one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work,</p>\n<p>carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to</p>\n<p>be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,</p>\n<p>or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of</p>\n<p>one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I</p>",
        "<p>know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not</p>\n<p>realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am</p>\n<p>a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am</p>\n<p>different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must</p>\n<p>always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know</p>\n<p>that you are better than he is. You are not stronger—you are too much</p>\n<p>afraid of life—but you are better. And how happy we used to be</p>",
        "<p>together! Don’t leave me, Basil, and don’t quarrel with me. I am what I</p>\n<p>am. There is nothing more to be said.”</p>\n<p>The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him,</p>\n<p>and his personality had been the great turning point in his art. He</p>\n<p>could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After all, his</p>\n<p>indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There was</p>\n<p>so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.</p>",
        "<p>“Well, Dorian,” he said at length, with a sad smile, “I won’t speak to</p>\n<p>you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust your</p>\n<p>name won’t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take</p>\n<p>place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?”</p>\n<p>Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at</p>\n<p>the mention of the word “inquest.” There was something so crude and</p>\n<p>vulgar about everything of the kind. “They don’t know my name,” he</p>",
        "<p>answered.</p>\n<p>“But surely she did?”</p>\n<p>“Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned</p>\n<p>to any one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn</p>\n<p>who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince</p>\n<p>Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,</p>\n<p>Basil. I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a</p>",
        "<p>few kisses and some broken pathetic words.”</p>\n<p>“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you</p>\n<p>must come and sit to me yourself again. I can’t get on without you.”</p>\n<p>“I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!” he exclaimed,</p>\n<p>starting back.</p>\n<p>The painter stared at him. “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried. “Do</p>\n<p>you mean to say you don’t like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have</p>",
        "<p>you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best</p>\n<p>thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply</p>\n<p>disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room</p>\n<p>looked different as I came in.”</p>\n<p>“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don’t imagine I let</p>\n<p>him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimes—that</p>\n<p>is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait.”</p>",
        "<p>“Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for</p>\n<p>it. Let me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.</p>\n<p>A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between</p>\n<p>the painter and the screen. “Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you</p>\n<p>must not look at it. I don’t wish you to.”</p>\n<p>“Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn’t I look at</p>\n<p>it?” exclaimed Hallward, laughing.</p>",
        "<p>“If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never</p>\n<p>speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don’t offer</p>\n<p>any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you</p>\n<p>touch this screen, everything is over between us.”</p>\n<p>Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute</p>\n<p>amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was actually</p>\n<p>pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes</p>",
        "<p>were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.</p>\n<p>“Dorian!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t speak!”</p>\n<p>“But what is the matter? Of course I won’t look at it if you don’t want</p>\n<p>me to,” he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over</p>\n<p>towards the window. “But, really, it seems rather absurd that I</p>\n<p>shouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in</p>",
        "<p>Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of</p>\n<p>varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?”</p>\n<p>“To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a</p>\n<p>strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be</p>\n<p>shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That</p>\n<p>was impossible. Something—he did not know what—had to be done at once.</p>\n<p>“Yes; I don’t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going</p>",
        "<p>to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de</p>\n<p>Sèze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only</p>\n<p>be away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for that</p>\n<p>time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep it</p>\n<p>always behind a screen, you can’t care much about it.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of</p>\n<p>perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible</p>",
        "<p>danger. “You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,” he</p>\n<p>cried. “Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being</p>\n<p>consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only difference</p>\n<p>is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can’t have forgotten</p>\n<p>that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would</p>\n<p>induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the</p>\n<p>same thing.” He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his</p>",
        "<p>eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half</p>\n<p>seriously and half in jest, “If you want to have a strange quarter of</p>\n<p>an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture. He</p>\n<p>told me why he wouldn’t, and it was a revelation to me.” Yes, perhaps</p>\n<p>Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.</p>\n<p>“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in</p>\n<p>the face, “we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall</p>",
        "<p>tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my</p>\n<p>picture?”</p>\n<p>The painter shuddered in spite of himself. “Dorian, if I told you, you</p>\n<p>might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I</p>\n<p>could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me</p>\n<p>never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you to</p>\n<p>look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from</p>",
        "<p>the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any</p>\n<p>fame or reputation.”</p>\n<p>“No, Basil, you must tell me,” insisted Dorian Gray. “I think I have a</p>\n<p>right to know.” His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity</p>\n<p>had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallward’s</p>\n<p>mystery.</p>\n<p>“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said the painter, looking troubled. “Let us</p>",
        "<p>sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the</p>\n<p>picture something curious?—something that probably at first did not</p>\n<p>strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?”</p>\n<p>“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling</p>\n<p>hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.</p>\n<p>“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.</p>\n<p>Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most</p>",
        "<p>extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and</p>\n<p>power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen</p>\n<p>ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I</p>\n<p>worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted</p>\n<p>to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When</p>\n<p>you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course,</p>\n<p>I never let you know anything about this. It would have been</p>",
        "<p>impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it</p>\n<p>myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that</p>\n<p>the world had become wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful, perhaps, for</p>\n<p>in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less</p>\n<p>than the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew</p>\n<p>more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn</p>\n<p>you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and</p>",
        "<p>polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on</p>\n<p>the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You</p>\n<p>had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the</p>\n<p>water’s silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had all been</p>\n<p>what art should be—unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day</p>\n<p>I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as</p>\n<p>you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own</p>",
        "<p>dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method,</p>\n<p>or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to</p>\n<p>me without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at</p>\n<p>it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I</p>\n<p>grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that</p>\n<p>I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it</p>\n<p>was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You</p>",
        "<p>were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant</p>\n<p>to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not</p>\n<p>mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I</p>\n<p>felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my</p>\n<p>studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of</p>\n<p>its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that</p>\n<p>I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely</p>",
        "<p>good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling</p>\n<p>that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is</p>\n<p>ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract</p>\n<p>than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour—that is all.</p>\n<p>It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely</p>\n<p>than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I</p>\n<p>determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.</p>",
        "<p>It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were</p>\n<p>right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,</p>\n<p>Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are</p>\n<p>made to be worshipped.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and</p>\n<p>a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the</p>\n<p>time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who</p>",
        "<p>had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he</p>\n<p>himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord</p>\n<p>Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was</p>\n<p>too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be</p>\n<p>some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry? Was that one of</p>\n<p>the things that life had in store?</p>\n<p>“It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,” said Hallward, “that you should</p>",
        "<p>have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?”</p>\n<p>“I saw something in it,” he answered, “something that seemed to me very</p>\n<p>curious.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you don’t mind my looking at the thing now?”</p>\n<p>Dorian shook his head. “You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not</p>\n<p>possibly let you stand in front of that picture.”</p>\n<p>“You will some day, surely?”</p>",
        "<p>“Never.”</p>\n<p>“Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been</p>\n<p>the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I</p>\n<p>have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don’t know what it cost</p>\n<p>me to tell you all that I have told you.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Basil,” said Dorian, “what have you told me? Simply that you</p>\n<p>felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment.”</p>",
        "<p>“It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I</p>\n<p>have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one</p>\n<p>should never put one’s worship into words.”</p>\n<p>“It was a very disappointing confession.”</p>\n<p>“Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn’t see anything else in the</p>\n<p>picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?”</p>\n<p>“No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn’t</p>",
        "<p>talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we</p>\n<p>must always remain so.”</p>\n<p>“You have got Harry,” said the painter sadly.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Harry!” cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. “Harry spends</p>\n<p>his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is</p>\n<p>improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I</p>\n<p>don’t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go</p>",
        "<p>to you, Basil.”</p>\n<p>“You will sit to me again?”</p>\n<p>“Impossible!”</p>\n<p>“You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes</p>\n<p>across two ideal things. Few come across one.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.</p>\n<p>There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I</p>",
        "<p>will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.”</p>\n<p>“Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,” murmured Hallward regretfully. “And</p>\n<p>now good-bye. I am sorry you won’t let me look at the picture once</p>\n<p>again. But that can’t be helped. I quite understand what you feel about</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How</p>\n<p>little he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead</p>",
        "<p>of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded,</p>\n<p>almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How much that</p>\n<p>strange confession explained to him! The painter’s absurd fits of</p>\n<p>jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious</p>\n<p>reticences—he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed</p>\n<p>to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.</p>\n<p>He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all</p>",
        "<p>costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad</p>\n<p>of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room</p>\n<p>to which any of his friends had access.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter X</h3>\n<p>When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if</p>\n<p>he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite</p>\n<p>impassive and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked</p>\n<p>over to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of</p>\n<p>Victor’s face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There</p>\n<p>was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his</p>",
        "<p>guard.</p>\n<p>Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he</p>\n<p>wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to</p>\n<p>send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man</p>\n<p>left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was</p>\n<p>that merely his own fancy?</p>\n<p>After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread</p>",
        "<p>mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He</p>\n<p>asked her for the key of the schoolroom.</p>\n<p>“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed. “Why, it is full of</p>\n<p>dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It</p>\n<p>is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.”</p>\n<p>“Well, sir, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it</p>",
        "<p>hasn’t been opened for nearly five years—not since his lordship died.”</p>\n<p>He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of</p>\n<p>him. “That does not matter,” he answered. “I simply want to see the</p>\n<p>place—that is all. Give me the key.”</p>\n<p>“And here is the key, sir,” said the old lady, going over the contents</p>\n<p>of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. “Here is the key. I’ll</p>\n<p>have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don’t think of living up</p>",
        "<p>there, sir, and you so comfortable here?”</p>\n<p>“No, no,” he cried petulantly. “Thank you, Leaf. That will do.”</p>\n<p>She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of</p>\n<p>the household. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought</p>\n<p>best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles.</p>\n<p>As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round</p>\n<p>the room. His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily</p>",
        "<p>embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century</p>\n<p>Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.</p>\n<p>Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps</p>\n<p>served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that</p>\n<p>had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death</p>\n<p>itself—something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What</p>\n<p>the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on</p>",
        "<p>the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They</p>\n<p>would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still</p>\n<p>live on. It would be always alive.</p>\n<p>He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil</p>\n<p>the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would</p>\n<p>have helped him to resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the still more</p>\n<p>poisonous influences that came from his own temperament. The love that</p>",
        "<p>he bore him—for it was really love—had nothing in it that was not noble</p>\n<p>and intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty</p>\n<p>that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. It was</p>\n<p>such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,</p>\n<p>and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was</p>\n<p>too late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or</p>\n<p>forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were</p>",
        "<p>passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that</p>\n<p>would make the shadow of their evil real.</p>\n<p>He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that</p>\n<p>covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was</p>\n<p>the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was</p>\n<p>unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue</p>\n<p>eyes, and rose-red lips—they all were there. It was simply the</p>",
        "<p>expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared</p>\n<p>to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil’s</p>\n<p>reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!—how shallow, and of what little</p>\n<p>account! His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and</p>\n<p>calling him to judgement. A look of pain came across him, and he flung</p>\n<p>the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door.</p>\n<p>He passed out as his servant entered.</p>",
        "<p>“The persons are here, Monsieur.”</p>\n<p>He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed</p>\n<p>to know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly</p>\n<p>about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the</p>\n<p>writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him</p>\n<p>round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at</p>\n<p>eight-fifteen that evening.</p>",
        "<p>“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men in</p>\n<p>here.”</p>\n<p>In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard</p>\n<p>himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in</p>\n<p>with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a</p>\n<p>florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was</p>\n<p>considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the</p>",
        "<p>artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He</p>\n<p>waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in</p>\n<p>favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed</p>\n<p>everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.</p>\n<p>“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled</p>\n<p>hands. “I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in</p>\n<p>person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a</p>",
        "<p>sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited</p>\n<p>for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.”</p>\n<p>“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.</p>\n<p>Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame—though I don’t</p>\n<p>go in much at present for religious art—but to-day I only want a</p>\n<p>picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so</p>\n<p>I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”</p>",
        "<p>“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to</p>\n<p>you. Which is the work of art, sir?”</p>\n<p>“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back. “Can you move it,</p>\n<p>covering and all, just as it is? I don’t want it to get scratched going</p>\n<p>upstairs.”</p>\n<p>“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame-maker,</p>\n<p>beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from</p>",
        "<p>the long brass chains by which it was suspended. “And, now, where shall</p>\n<p>we carry it to, Mr. Gray?”</p>\n<p>“I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or</p>\n<p>perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top</p>\n<p>of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.”</p>\n<p>He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and</p>\n<p>began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the</p>",
        "<p>picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious</p>\n<p>protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman’s spirited dislike</p>\n<p>of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it</p>\n<p>so as to help them.</p>\n<p>“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man when they</p>\n<p>reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.</p>\n<p>“I am afraid it is rather heavy,” murmured Dorian as he unlocked the</p>",
        "<p>door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious</p>\n<p>secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.</p>\n<p>He had not entered the place for more than four years—not, indeed,</p>\n<p>since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then</p>\n<p>as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a large,</p>\n<p>well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord</p>\n<p>Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness</p>",
        "<p>to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and</p>\n<p>desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but little</p>\n<p>changed. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically</p>\n<p>painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so</p>\n<p>often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case filled</p>\n<p>with his dog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the</p>\n<p>same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing</p>",
        "<p>chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded</p>\n<p>birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every</p>\n<p>moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. He</p>\n<p>recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed</p>\n<p>horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden</p>\n<p>away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in</p>\n<p>store for him!</p>",
        "<p>But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as</p>\n<p>this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its</p>\n<p>purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,</p>\n<p>and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would</p>\n<p>not see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He</p>\n<p>kept his youth—that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow</p>\n<p>finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full</p>",
        "<p>of shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and</p>\n<p>shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit</p>\n<p>and in flesh—those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them</p>\n<p>their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would</p>\n<p>have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to</p>\n<p>the world Basil Hallward’s masterpiece.</p>\n<p>No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon</p>",
        "<p>the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but</p>\n<p>the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become</p>\n<p>hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow’s feet would creep round the fading eyes</p>\n<p>and make them horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth</p>\n<p>would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old</p>\n<p>men are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined</p>\n<p>hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had</p>",
        "<p>been so stern to him in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed.</p>\n<p>There was no help for it.</p>\n<p>“Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,” he said, wearily, turning round. “I</p>\n<p>am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else.”</p>\n<p>“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker, who</p>\n<p>was still gasping for breath. “Where shall we put it, sir?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don’t want to have it hung up.</p>",
        "<p>Just lean it against the wall. Thanks.”</p>\n<p>“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”</p>\n<p>Dorian started. “It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,” he said,</p>\n<p>keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling</p>\n<p>him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that</p>\n<p>concealed the secret of his life. “I shan’t trouble you any more now. I</p>\n<p>am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”</p>",
        "<p>“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,</p>\n<p>sir.” And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,</p>\n<p>who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough</p>\n<p>uncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous.</p>\n<p>When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door</p>\n<p>and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look</p>\n<p>upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.</p>",
        "<p>On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o’clock</p>\n<p>and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark</p>\n<p>perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley,</p>\n<p>his guardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid, who had spent the</p>\n<p>preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside</p>\n<p>it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the</p>\n<p>edges soiled. A copy of the third edition of _The St. James’s Gazette_</p>",
        "<p>had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had</p>\n<p>returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were</p>\n<p>leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.</p>\n<p>He would be sure to miss the picture—had no doubt missed it already,</p>\n<p>while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set</p>\n<p>back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he</p>\n<p>might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the</p>",
        "<p>room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one’s house. He had</p>\n<p>heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some</p>\n<p>servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked</p>\n<p>up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower</p>\n<p>or a shred of crumpled lace.</p>\n<p>He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry’s</p>\n<p>note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,</p>",
        "<p>and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at</p>\n<p>eight-fifteen. He opened _The St. James’s_ languidly, and looked</p>\n<p>through it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It drew</p>\n<p>attention to the following paragraph:</p>\n<p>INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.—An inquest was held this morning at the Bell</p>\n<p>Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of</p>\n<p>Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,</p>",
        "<p>Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable</p>\n<p>sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly</p>\n<p>affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr.</p>\n<p>Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.</p>\n<p>He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and</p>\n<p>flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real</p>\n<p>ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for</p>",
        "<p>having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him to have</p>\n<p>marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more</p>\n<p>than enough English for that.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet,</p>\n<p>what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane’s death?</p>\n<p>There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her.</p>\n<p>His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was</p>",
        "<p>it, he wondered. He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal</p>\n<p>stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange</p>\n<p>Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung</p>\n<p>himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves. After a</p>\n<p>few minutes he became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he had</p>\n<p>ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the</p>\n<p>delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb</p>",
        "<p>show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made</p>\n<p>real to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually</p>\n<p>revealed.</p>\n<p>It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,</p>\n<p>indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who</p>\n<p>spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the</p>\n<p>passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his</p>",
        "<p>own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through</p>\n<p>which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere</p>\n<p>artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,</p>\n<p>as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The</p>\n<p>style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid</p>\n<p>and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical</p>\n<p>expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work</p>",
        "<p>of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.</p>\n<p>There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in</p>\n<p>colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical</p>\n<p>philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the</p>\n<p>spiritual ecstasies of some mediæval saint or the morbid confessions of</p>\n<p>a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense</p>\n<p>seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere</p>",
        "<p>cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full</p>\n<p>as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,</p>\n<p>produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,</p>\n<p>a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of</p>\n<p>the falling day and creeping shadows.</p>\n<p>Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed</p>\n<p>through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no</p>",
        "<p>more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the</p>\n<p>lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed</p>\n<p>the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his</p>\n<p>bedside and began to dress for dinner.</p>\n<p>It was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found</p>\n<p>Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.</p>\n<p>“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely your</p>",
        "<p>fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the</p>\n<p>time was going.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from his</p>\n<p>chair.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a</p>\n<p>great difference.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you have discovered that?” murmured Lord Henry. And they passed</p>",
        "<p>into the dining-room.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter XI</h3>\n<p>For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of</p>\n<p>this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never</p>\n<p>sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than</p>\n<p>nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in</p>\n<p>different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the</p>\n<p>changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have</p>",
        "<p>almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in</p>\n<p>whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely</p>\n<p>blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,</p>\n<p>indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own</p>\n<p>life, written before he had lived it.</p>\n<p>In one point he was more fortunate than the novel’s fantastic hero. He</p>\n<p>never knew—never, indeed, had any cause to know—that somewhat grotesque</p>",
        "<p>dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which</p>\n<p>came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned</p>\n<p>by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so</p>\n<p>remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy—and perhaps in nearly every</p>\n<p>joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place—that he used</p>\n<p>to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if</p>\n<p>somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who</p>",
        "<p>had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly</p>\n<p>valued.</p>\n<p>For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and</p>\n<p>many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had</p>\n<p>heard the most evil things against him—and from time to time strange</p>\n<p>rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the</p>\n<p>chatter of the clubs—could not believe anything to his dishonour when</p>",
        "<p>they saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself</p>\n<p>unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his</p>\n<p>face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the</p>\n<p>memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one</p>\n<p>so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an</p>\n<p>age that was at once sordid and sensual.</p>",
        "<p>Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged</p>\n<p>absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were</p>\n<p>his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep</p>\n<p>upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left</p>\n<p>him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil</p>\n<p>Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on</p>\n<p>the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him</p>",
        "<p>from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to</p>\n<p>quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his</p>\n<p>own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.</p>\n<p>He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and</p>\n<p>terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead</p>\n<p>or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which</p>\n<p>were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would</p>",
        "<p>place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,</p>\n<p>and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.</p>\n<p>There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own</p>\n<p>delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little</p>\n<p>ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in</p>\n<p>disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he</p>\n<p>had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant</p>",
        "<p>because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare.</p>\n<p>That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as</p>\n<p>they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase</p>\n<p>with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He</p>\n<p>had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.</p>\n<p>Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to</p>\n<p>society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each</p>",
        "<p>Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the</p>\n<p>world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the</p>\n<p>day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little</p>\n<p>dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were</p>\n<p>noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,</p>\n<p>as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with</p>\n<p>its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered</p>",
        "<p>cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many,</p>\n<p>especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,</p>\n<p>in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often</p>\n<p>dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of</p>\n<p>the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and</p>\n<p>perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be of</p>\n<p>the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to “make</p>",
        "<p>themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.” Like Gautier, he was one</p>\n<p>for whom “the visible world existed.”</p>\n<p>And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the</p>\n<p>arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.</p>\n<p>Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment</p>\n<p>universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert</p>\n<p>the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for</p>",
        "<p>him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to</p>\n<p>time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of</p>\n<p>the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in</p>\n<p>everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of</p>\n<p>his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.</p>\n<p>For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost</p>\n<p>immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a</p>",
        "<p>subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the</p>\n<p>London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the</p>\n<p>Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be</p>\n<p>something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on</p>\n<p>the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of</p>\n<p>a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have</p>\n<p>its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the</p>",
        "<p>spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.</p>\n<p>The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been</p>\n<p>decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and</p>\n<p>sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are</p>\n<p>conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.</p>\n<p>But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had</p>\n<p>never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal</p>",
        "<p>merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or</p>\n<p>to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a</p>\n<p>new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the</p>\n<p>dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through</p>\n<p>history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been</p>\n<p>surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful</p>\n<p>rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose</p>",
        "<p>origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more</p>\n<p>terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,</p>\n<p>they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out</p>\n<p>the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to</p>\n<p>the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.</p>\n<p>Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that</p>\n<p>was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism</p>",
        "<p>that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its</p>\n<p>service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any</p>\n<p>theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of</p>\n<p>passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself,</p>\n<p>and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of</p>\n<p>the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy</p>\n<p>that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to</p>",
        "<p>concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a</p>\n<p>moment.</p>\n<p>There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either</p>\n<p>after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of</p>\n<p>death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through</p>\n<p>the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality</p>\n<p>itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,</p>",
        "<p>and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one</p>\n<p>might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled</p>\n<p>with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the</p>\n<p>curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb</p>\n<p>shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside,</p>\n<p>there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men</p>\n<p>going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down</p>",
        "<p>from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it</p>\n<p>feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from</p>\n<p>her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by</p>\n<p>degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we</p>\n<p>watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan</p>\n<p>mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we</p>\n<p>had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been</p>",
        "<p>studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the</p>\n<p>letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.</p>\n<p>Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night</p>\n<p>comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where</p>\n<p>we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the</p>\n<p>necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of</p>\n<p>stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids</p>",
        "<p>might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in</p>\n<p>the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh</p>\n<p>shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in</p>\n<p>which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,</p>\n<p>in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of</p>\n<p>joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.</p>\n<p>It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray</p>",
        "<p>to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his</p>\n<p>search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and</p>\n<p>possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he</p>\n<p>would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really</p>\n<p>alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and</p>\n<p>then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his</p>\n<p>intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that</p>",
        "<p>is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,</p>\n<p>indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition</p>\n<p>of it.</p>\n<p>It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman</p>\n<p>Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great</p>\n<p>attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the</p>\n<p>sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb</p>",
        "<p>rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity</p>\n<p>of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it</p>\n<p>sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement</p>\n<p>and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with</p>\n<p>white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft</p>\n<p>the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at</p>\n<p>times, one would fain think, is indeed the “_panis cælestis_,” the</p>",
        "<p>bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ,</p>\n<p>breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.</p>\n<p>The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet,</p>\n<p>tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle</p>\n<p>fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at</p>\n<p>the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of</p>\n<p>them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating</p>",
        "<p>the true story of their lives.</p>\n<p>But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual</p>\n<p>development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of</p>\n<p>mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable</p>\n<p>for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which</p>\n<p>there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its</p>\n<p>marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle</p>",
        "<p>antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a</p>\n<p>season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of</p>\n<p>the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in</p>\n<p>tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the</p>\n<p>brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of</p>\n<p>the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,</p>\n<p>morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him</p>",
        "<p>before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance</p>\n<p>compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all</p>\n<p>intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.</p>\n<p>He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual</p>\n<p>mysteries to reveal.</p>\n<p>And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their</p>\n<p>manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums</p>",
        "<p>from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not</p>\n<p>its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their</p>\n<p>true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one</p>\n<p>mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one’s passions, and in violets</p>\n<p>that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the</p>\n<p>brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often</p>\n<p>to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several</p>",
        "<p>influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;</p>\n<p>of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that</p>\n<p>sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to</p>\n<p>be able to expel melancholy from the soul.</p>\n<p>At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long</p>\n<p>latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of</p>\n<p>olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad</p>",
        "<p>gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled</p>\n<p>Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while</p>\n<p>grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching</p>\n<p>upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of</p>\n<p>reed or brass and charmed—or feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and</p>\n<p>horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of</p>\n<p>barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and Chopin’s</p>",
        "<p>beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell</p>\n<p>unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world</p>\n<p>the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of</p>\n<p>dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact</p>\n<p>with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the</p>\n<p>mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not</p>\n<p>allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been</p>",
        "<p>subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the</p>\n<p>Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human</p>\n<p>bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green</p>\n<p>jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular</p>\n<p>sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when</p>\n<p>they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the</p>\n<p>performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the</p>",
        "<p>harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who</p>\n<p>sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a</p>\n<p>distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating</p>\n<p>tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an</p>\n<p>elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells</p>\n<p>of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge</p>\n<p>cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the</p>",
        "<p>one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican</p>\n<p>temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a</p>\n<p>description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated</p>\n<p>him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like</p>\n<p>Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous</p>\n<p>voices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his</p>\n<p>box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt</p>",
        "<p>pleasure to “Tannhauser” and seeing in the prelude to that great work</p>\n<p>of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.</p>\n<p>On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a</p>\n<p>costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered</p>\n<p>with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for</p>\n<p>years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often</p>\n<p>spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various</p>",
        "<p>stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that</p>\n<p>turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,</p>\n<p>the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,</p>\n<p>carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red</p>\n<p>cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their</p>\n<p>alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the</p>\n<p>sunstone, and the moonstone’s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow</p>",
        "<p>of the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of</p>\n<p>extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la</p>\n<p>vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.</p>\n<p>He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso’s</p>\n<p>Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real</p>\n<p>jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of</p>\n<p>Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes “with</p>",
        "<p>collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.” There was a gem in</p>\n<p>the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and “by the exhibition</p>\n<p>of golden letters and a scarlet robe” the monster could be thrown into</p>\n<p>a magical sleep and slain. According to the great alchemist, Pierre de</p>\n<p>Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India</p>\n<p>made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth</p>\n<p>provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The</p>",
        "<p>garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her</p>\n<p>colour. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus,</p>\n<p>that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.</p>\n<p>Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a</p>\n<p>newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The</p>\n<p>bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm</p>\n<p>that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the</p>",
        "<p>aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any</p>\n<p>danger by fire.</p>\n<p>The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand,</p>\n<p>as the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the</p>\n<p>Priest were “made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake</p>\n<p>inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.” Over the gable</p>\n<p>were “two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,” so that the</p>",
        "<p>gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge’s strange</p>\n<p>romance ‘A Margarite of America’, it was stated that in the chamber of</p>\n<p>the queen one could behold “all the chaste ladies of the world,</p>\n<p>inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites,</p>\n<p>carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.” Marco Polo had seen the</p>\n<p>inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the</p>\n<p>dead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver</p>",
        "<p>brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven</p>\n<p>moons over its loss. When the Huns lured the king into the great pit,</p>\n<p>he flung it away—Procopius tells the story—nor was it ever found again,</p>\n<p>though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold</p>\n<p>pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a</p>\n<p>rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he</p>\n<p>worshipped.</p>",
        "<p>When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII.</p>\n<p>of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to</p>\n<p>Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great</p>\n<p>light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred</p>\n<p>and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty</p>\n<p>thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described</p>\n<p>Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as</p>",
        "<p>wearing “a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds</p>\n<p>and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large</p>\n<p>balasses.” The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in</p>\n<p>gold filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold</p>\n<p>armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with</p>\n<p>turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parsemé_ with pearls. Henry II. wore</p>\n<p>jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with</p>",
        "<p>twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the</p>\n<p>Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped</p>\n<p>pearls and studded with sapphires.</p>\n<p>How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and</p>\n<p>decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.</p>\n<p>Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that</p>\n<p>performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern</p>",
        "<p>nations of Europe. As he investigated the subject—and he always had an</p>\n<p>extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in</p>\n<p>whatever he took up—he was almost saddened by the reflection of the</p>\n<p>ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any</p>\n<p>rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils</p>\n<p>bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of</p>\n<p>their shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained</p>",
        "<p>his flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where</p>\n<p>had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which</p>\n<p>the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls</p>\n<p>for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had</p>\n<p>stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on</p>\n<p>which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot</p>\n<p>drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious</p>",
        "<p>table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were</p>\n<p>displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;</p>\n<p>the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden</p>\n<p>bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of</p>\n<p>Pontus and were figured with “lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,</p>\n<p>rocks, hunters—all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature”; and</p>\n<p>the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which</p>",
        "<p>were embroidered the verses of a song beginning “_Madame, je suis tout</p>\n<p>joyeux_,” the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold</p>\n<p>thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four</p>\n<p>pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims</p>\n<p>for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with “thirteen</p>\n<p>hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the</p>\n<p>king’s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings</p>",
        "<p>were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked</p>\n<p>in gold.” Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black</p>\n<p>velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask,</p>\n<p>with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground,</p>\n<p>and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in</p>\n<p>a room hung with rows of the queen’s devices in cut black velvet upon</p>\n<p>cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen</p>",
        "<p>feet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,</p>\n<p>was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses</p>\n<p>from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased,</p>\n<p>and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been</p>\n<p>taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed</p>\n<p>had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.</p>\n<p>And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite</p>",
        "<p>specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting</p>\n<p>the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and</p>\n<p>stitched over with iridescent beetles’ wings; the Dacca gauzes, that</p>\n<p>from their transparency are known in the East as “woven air,” and</p>\n<p>“running water,” and “evening dew”; strange figured cloths from Java;</p>\n<p>elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair</p>\n<p>blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of</p>",
        "<p>_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish</p>\n<p>velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,</p>\n<p>with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.</p>\n<p>He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed</p>\n<p>he had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the</p>\n<p>long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had</p>\n<p>stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the</p>",
        "<p>raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and</p>\n<p>fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by</p>\n<p>the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He</p>\n<p>possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,</p>\n<p>figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in</p>\n<p>six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the</p>\n<p>pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided</p>",
        "<p>into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the</p>\n<p>coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.</p>\n<p>This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of</p>\n<p>green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,</p>\n<p>from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which</p>\n<p>were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse</p>\n<p>bore a seraph’s head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were</p>",
        "<p>woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with</p>\n<p>medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He</p>\n<p>had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold</p>\n<p>brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with</p>\n<p>representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and</p>\n<p>embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of</p>\n<p>white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins</p>",
        "<p>and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen;</p>\n<p>and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices</p>\n<p>to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his</p>\n<p>imagination.</p>\n<p>For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely</p>\n<p>house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he</p>\n<p>could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times</p>",
        "<p>to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked</p>\n<p>room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his</p>\n<p>own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the</p>\n<p>real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the</p>\n<p>purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there,</p>\n<p>would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,</p>\n<p>his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.</p>",
        "<p>Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to</p>\n<p>dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,</p>\n<p>until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the</p>\n<p>picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times,</p>\n<p>with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin,</p>\n<p>and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to</p>\n<p>bear the burden that should have been his own.</p>",
        "<p>After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and</p>\n<p>gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as</p>\n<p>well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more</p>\n<p>than once spent the winter. He hated to be separated from the picture</p>\n<p>that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his</p>\n<p>absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the</p>\n<p>elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.</p>",
        "<p>He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true</p>\n<p>that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness</p>\n<p>of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn</p>\n<p>from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him. He had not</p>\n<p>painted it. What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?</p>\n<p>Even if he told them, would they believe it?</p>\n<p>Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in</p>",
        "<p>Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank</p>\n<p>who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton</p>\n<p>luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly</p>\n<p>leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not</p>\n<p>been tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it</p>\n<p>should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold with horror. Surely</p>\n<p>the world would know his secret then. Perhaps the world already</p>",
        "<p>suspected it.</p>\n<p>For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.</p>\n<p>He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth</p>\n<p>and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was</p>\n<p>said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the</p>\n<p>smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another</p>\n<p>gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories</p>",
        "<p>became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year. It</p>\n<p>was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a</p>\n<p>low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with</p>\n<p>thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His</p>\n<p>extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear</p>\n<p>again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass</p>\n<p>him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though</p>",
        "<p>they were determined to discover his secret.</p>\n<p>Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,</p>\n<p>and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his</p>\n<p>charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth</p>\n<p>that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer</p>\n<p>to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about</p>\n<p>him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most</p>",
        "<p>intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had</p>\n<p>wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and</p>\n<p>set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or</p>\n<p>horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.</p>\n<p>Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his</p>\n<p>strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of</p>\n<p>security. Society—civilized society, at least—is never very ready to</p>",
        "<p>believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and</p>\n<p>fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance</p>\n<p>than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much</p>\n<p>less value than the possession of a good _chef_. And, after all, it is</p>\n<p>a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad</p>\n<p>dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the</p>\n<p>cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrées_, as Lord Henry</p>",
        "<p>remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a</p>\n<p>good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are,</p>\n<p>or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely</p>\n<p>essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as</p>\n<p>its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic</p>\n<p>play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is</p>\n<p>insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method</p>",
        "<p>by which we can multiply our personalities.</p>\n<p>Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion. He used to wonder at the</p>\n<p>shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing</p>\n<p>simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a</p>\n<p>being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform</p>\n<p>creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and</p>\n<p>passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies</p>",
        "<p>of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery</p>\n<p>of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose</p>\n<p>blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by</p>\n<p>Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and</p>\n<p>King James, as one who was “caressed by the Court for his handsome</p>\n<p>face, which kept him not long company.” Was it young Herbert’s life</p>\n<p>that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body</p>",
        "<p>to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that</p>\n<p>ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,</p>\n<p>give utterance, in Basil Hallward’s studio, to the mad prayer that had</p>\n<p>so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled</p>\n<p>surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,</p>\n<p>with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet. What had this man’s</p>\n<p>legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some</p>",
        "<p>inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams</p>\n<p>that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading</p>\n<p>canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl</p>\n<p>stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand,</p>\n<p>and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On</p>\n<p>a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green</p>\n<p>rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the</p>",
        "<p>strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of</p>\n<p>her temperament in him? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look</p>\n<p>curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and</p>\n<p>fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and</p>\n<p>swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.</p>\n<p>Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so</p>\n<p>overladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century,</p>",
        "<p>and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord</p>\n<p>Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and</p>\n<p>one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How</p>\n<p>proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!</p>\n<p>What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as</p>\n<p>infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the</p>\n<p>Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his</p>",
        "<p>wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred</p>\n<p>within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady</p>\n<p>Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips—he knew what he had got</p>\n<p>from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the</p>\n<p>beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.</p>\n<p>There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she</p>\n<p>was holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes</p>",
        "<p>were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They</p>\n<p>seemed to follow him wherever he went.</p>\n<p>Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one’s own race,</p>\n<p>nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly</p>\n<p>with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There</p>\n<p>were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history</p>\n<p>was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act</p>",
        "<p>and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it</p>\n<p>had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known</p>\n<p>them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the</p>\n<p>stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of</p>\n<p>subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had</p>\n<p>been his own.</p>\n<p>The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had</p>",
        "<p>himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how,</p>\n<p>crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as</p>\n<p>Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of</p>\n<p>Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the</p>\n<p>flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had</p>\n<p>caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in</p>\n<p>an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had</p>",
        "<p>wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round</p>\n<p>with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his</p>\n<p>days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _tædium vitæ_, that comes</p>\n<p>on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear</p>\n<p>emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of</p>\n<p>pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the</p>\n<p>Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero</p>",
        "<p>Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with</p>\n<p>colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon</p>\n<p>from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.</p>\n<p>Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the</p>\n<p>two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious</p>\n<p>tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and</p>\n<p>beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made</p>",
        "<p>monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted</p>\n<p>her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the</p>\n<p>dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the</p>\n<p>Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and</p>\n<p>whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the</p>\n<p>price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase</p>\n<p>living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot</p>",
        "<p>who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide</p>\n<p>riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto;</p>\n<p>Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and</p>\n<p>minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery,</p>\n<p>and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson</p>\n<p>silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might</p>\n<p>serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy</p>",
        "<p>could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion</p>\n<p>for red blood, as other men have for red wine—the son of the Fiend, as</p>\n<p>was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling</p>\n<p>with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the</p>\n<p>name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads</p>\n<p>was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of</p>\n<p>Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the</p>",
        "<p>enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave</p>\n<p>poison to Ginevra d’Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a</p>\n<p>shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles</p>\n<p>VI., who had so wildly adored his brother’s wife that a leper had</p>\n<p>warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his</p>\n<p>brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen</p>\n<p>cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in</p>",
        "<p>his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto</p>\n<p>Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page,</p>\n<p>and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow</p>\n<p>piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep,</p>\n<p>and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.</p>\n<p>There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and</p>\n<p>they troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of</p>",
        "<p>strange manners of poisoning—poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch,</p>\n<p>by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by</p>\n<p>an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There were</p>\n<p>moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could</p>\n<p>realize his conception of the beautiful.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XII</h3>\n<p>It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth</p>\n<p>birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.</p>\n<p>He was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where he</p>\n<p>had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold</p>\n<p>and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a</p>\n<p>man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of</p>",
        "<p>his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized</p>\n<p>him. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could</p>\n<p>not account, came over him. He made no sign of recognition and went on</p>\n<p>quickly in the direction of his own house.</p>\n<p>But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the</p>\n<p>pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on</p>\n<p>his arm.</p>",
        "<p>“Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for</p>\n<p>you in your library ever since nine o’clock. Finally I took pity on</p>\n<p>your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am</p>\n<p>off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see</p>\n<p>you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as</p>\n<p>you passed me. But I wasn’t quite sure. Didn’t you recognize me?”</p>\n<p>“In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor</p>",
        "<p>Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel at</p>\n<p>all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen</p>\n<p>you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?”</p>\n<p>“No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a</p>\n<p>studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture</p>\n<p>I have in my head. However, it wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk.</p>\n<p>Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something</p>",
        "<p>to say to you.”</p>\n<p>“I shall be charmed. But won’t you miss your train?” said Dorian Gray</p>\n<p>languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his</p>\n<p>latch-key.</p>\n<p>The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his</p>\n<p>watch. “I have heaps of time,” he answered. “The train doesn’t go till</p>\n<p>twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to</p>",
        "<p>the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan’t have any</p>\n<p>delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with</p>\n<p>me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”</p>\n<p>Dorian looked at him and smiled. “What a way for a fashionable painter</p>\n<p>to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get</p>\n<p>into the house. And mind you don’t talk about anything serious. Nothing</p>\n<p>is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be.”</p>",
        "<p>Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the</p>\n<p>library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.</p>\n<p>The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with</p>\n<p>some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little</p>\n<p>marqueterie table.</p>\n<p>“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me</p>\n<p>everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is</p>",
        "<p>a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman</p>\n<p>you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?”</p>\n<p>Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I believe he married Lady Radley’s</p>\n<p>maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.</p>\n<p>_Anglomanie_ is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly</p>\n<p>of the French, doesn’t it? But—do you know?—he was not at all a bad</p>\n<p>servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One</p>",
        "<p>often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted</p>\n<p>to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another</p>\n<p>brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take</p>\n<p>hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said the painter, taking his cap</p>\n<p>and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the</p>\n<p>corner. “And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.</p>",
        "<p>Don’t frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.”</p>\n<p>“What is it all about?” cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging</p>\n<p>himself down on the sofa. “I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of</p>\n<p>myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.”</p>\n<p>“It is about yourself,” answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, “and</p>\n<p>I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.”</p>\n<p>Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. “Half an hour!” he murmured.</p>",
        "<p>“It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own</p>\n<p>sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that the</p>\n<p>most dreadful things are being said against you in London.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other</p>\n<p>people, but scandals about myself don’t interest me. They have not got</p>\n<p>the charm of novelty.”</p>\n<p>“They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his</p>",
        "<p>good name. You don’t want people to talk of you as something vile and</p>\n<p>degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all</p>\n<p>that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind</p>\n<p>you, I don’t believe these rumours at all. At least, I can’t believe</p>\n<p>them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s</p>\n<p>face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.</p>\n<p>There are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself</p>",
        "<p>in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of</p>\n<p>his hands even. Somebody—I won’t mention his name, but you know</p>\n<p>him—came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen</p>\n<p>him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though</p>\n<p>I have heard a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I</p>\n<p>refused him. There was something in the shape of his fingers that I</p>\n<p>hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.</p>",
        "<p>His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent</p>\n<p>face, and your marvellous untroubled youth—I can’t believe anything</p>\n<p>against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to</p>\n<p>the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these</p>\n<p>hideous things that people are whispering about you, I don’t know what</p>\n<p>to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves</p>\n<p>the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen</p>",
        "<p>in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs? You</p>\n<p>used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week.</p>\n<p>Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the</p>\n<p>miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley</p>\n<p>curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes,</p>\n<p>but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to</p>\n<p>know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I</p>",
        "<p>reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.</p>\n<p>He told me. He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why</p>\n<p>is your friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy</p>\n<p>in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There</p>\n<p>was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.</p>\n<p>You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his</p>\n<p>dreadful end? What about Lord Kent’s only son and his career? I met his</p>",
        "<p>father yesterday in St. James’s Street. He seemed broken with shame and</p>\n<p>sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he</p>\n<p>got now? What gentleman would associate with him?”</p>\n<p>“Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,”</p>\n<p>said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt</p>\n<p>in his voice. “You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It</p>\n<p>is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows</p>",
        "<p>anything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could</p>\n<p>his record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did</p>\n<p>I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kent’s</p>\n<p>silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me? If</p>\n<p>Adrian Singleton writes his friend’s name across a bill, am I his</p>\n<p>keeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air</p>\n<p>their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper</p>",
        "<p>about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try</p>\n<p>and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with</p>\n<p>the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to</p>\n<p>have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.</p>\n<p>And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead</p>\n<p>themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land</p>\n<p>of the hypocrite.”</p>",
        "<p>“Dorian,” cried Hallward, “that is not the question. England is bad</p>\n<p>enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why</p>\n<p>I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to judge</p>\n<p>of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all</p>\n<p>sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a</p>\n<p>madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them</p>\n<p>there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are</p>",
        "<p>smiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry are</p>\n<p>inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not</p>\n<p>have made his sister’s name a by-word.”</p>\n<p>“Take care, Basil. You go too far.”</p>\n<p>“I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady</p>\n<p>Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a</p>\n<p>single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?</p>",
        "<p>Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then there are</p>\n<p>other stories—stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of</p>\n<p>dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in</p>\n<p>London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I</p>\n<p>laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your</p>\n<p>country-house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you don’t know</p>\n<p>what is said about you. I won’t tell you that I don’t want to preach to</p>",
        "<p>you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself</p>\n<p>into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and</p>\n<p>then proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want</p>\n<p>you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you</p>\n<p>to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the</p>\n<p>dreadful people you associate with. Don’t shrug your shoulders like</p>\n<p>that. Don’t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it</p>",
        "<p>be for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with</p>\n<p>whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to</p>\n<p>enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after. I don’t know</p>\n<p>whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am</p>\n<p>told things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one</p>\n<p>of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife</p>\n<p>had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.</p>",
        "<p>Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read. I</p>\n<p>told him that it was absurd—that I knew you thoroughly, and that you</p>\n<p>were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know</p>\n<p>you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.”</p>\n<p>“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and</p>\n<p>turning almost white from fear.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his</p>",
        "<p>voice, “to see your soul. But only God can do that.”</p>\n<p>A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. “You</p>\n<p>shall see it yourself, to-night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from the</p>\n<p>table. “Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn’t you look at it?</p>\n<p>You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody</p>\n<p>would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the</p>\n<p>better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate</p>",
        "<p>about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough</p>\n<p>about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face.”</p>\n<p>There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his</p>\n<p>foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible</p>\n<p>joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that</p>\n<p>the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his</p>\n<p>shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous</p>",
        "<p>memory of what he had done.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into</p>\n<p>his stern eyes, “I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that</p>\n<p>you fancy only God can see.”</p>\n<p>Hallward started back. “This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried. “You must</p>\n<p>not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don’t mean</p>\n<p>anything.”</p>",
        "<p>“You think so?” He laughed again.</p>\n<p>“I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your</p>\n<p>good. You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t touch me. Finish what you have to say.”</p>\n<p>A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter’s face. He paused for a</p>\n<p>moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right</p>\n<p>had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of</p>",
        "<p>what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he</p>\n<p>straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood</p>\n<p>there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their</p>\n<p>throbbing cores of flame.</p>\n<p>“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man in a hard clear voice.</p>\n<p>He turned round. “What I have to say is this,” he cried. “You must give</p>\n<p>me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If</p>",
        "<p>you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I</p>\n<p>shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can’t you see what I</p>\n<p>am going through? My God! don’t tell me that you are bad, and corrupt,</p>\n<p>and shameful.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. “Come</p>\n<p>upstairs, Basil,” he said quietly. “I keep a diary of my life from day</p>\n<p>to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall</p>",
        "<p>show it to you if you come with me.”</p>\n<p>“I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my</p>\n<p>train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don’t ask me to</p>\n<p>read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.”</p>\n<p>“That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You</p>\n<p>will not have to read long.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XIII</h3>\n<p>He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward</p>\n<p>following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at</p>\n<p>night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A</p>\n<p>rising wind made some of the windows rattle.</p>\n<p>When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the</p>\n<p>floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. “You insist on</p>",
        "<p>knowing, Basil?” he asked in a low voice.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat</p>\n<p>harshly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know</p>\n<p>everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you</p>\n<p>think”; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold</p>\n<p>current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a</p>",
        "<p>flame of murky orange. He shuddered. “Shut the door behind you,” he</p>\n<p>whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.</p>\n<p>Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked</p>\n<p>as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a</p>\n<p>curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty</p>\n<p>book-case—that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a</p>\n<p>table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was</p>",
        "<p>standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered</p>\n<p>with dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling</p>\n<p>behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.</p>\n<p>“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that</p>\n<p>curtain back, and you will see mine.”</p>\n<p>The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. “You are mad, Dorian, or</p>\n<p>playing a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning.</p>",
        "<p>“You won’t? Then I must do it myself,” said the young man, and he tore</p>\n<p>the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.</p>\n<p>An exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the</p>\n<p>dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was</p>\n<p>something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.</p>\n<p>Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was looking at! The</p>\n<p>horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous</p>",
        "<p>beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet</p>\n<p>on the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something of the</p>\n<p>loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely</p>\n<p>passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it</p>\n<p>was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own</p>\n<p>brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous,</p>\n<p>yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the</p>",
        "<p>picture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long</p>\n<p>letters of bright vermilion.</p>\n<p>It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never</p>\n<p>done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if</p>\n<p>his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His own</p>\n<p>picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned and looked at</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched, and his</p>",
        "<p>parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand across</p>\n<p>his forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.</p>\n<p>The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with</p>\n<p>that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are</p>\n<p>absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither</p>\n<p>real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the</p>\n<p>spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken</p>",
        "<p>the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do</p>\n<p>so.</p>\n<p>“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded</p>\n<p>shrill and curious in his ears.</p>\n<p>“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in</p>\n<p>his hand, “you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my</p>\n<p>good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who</p>",
        "<p>explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me</p>\n<p>that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even</p>\n<p>now, I don’t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you</p>\n<p>would call it a prayer....”</p>\n<p>“I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is</p>\n<p>impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The</p>\n<p>paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the</p>",
        "<p>thing is impossible.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the</p>\n<p>window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.</p>\n<p>“You told me you had destroyed it.”</p>\n<p>“I was wrong. It has destroyed me.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe it is my picture.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you see your ideal in it?” said Dorian bitterly.</p>",
        "<p>“My ideal, as you call it...”</p>\n<p>“As you called it.”</p>\n<p>“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an</p>\n<p>ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.”</p>\n<p>“It is the face of my soul.”</p>\n<p>“Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a</p>\n<p>devil.”</p>",
        "<p>“Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian with a</p>\n<p>wild gesture of despair.</p>\n<p>Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. “My God! If it</p>\n<p>is true,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your life,</p>\n<p>why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you</p>\n<p>to be!” He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The</p>\n<p>surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it. It was</p>",
        "<p>from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through</p>\n<p>some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly</p>\n<p>eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was</p>\n<p>not so fearful.</p>\n<p>His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and</p>\n<p>lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he</p>\n<p>flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and</p>",
        "<p>buried his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!” There was no</p>\n<p>answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. “Pray,</p>\n<p>Dorian, pray,” he murmured. “What is it that one was taught to say in</p>\n<p>one’s boyhood? ‘Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins. Wash</p>\n<p>away our iniquities.’ Let us say that together. The prayer of your</p>\n<p>pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered</p>",
        "<p>also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped</p>\n<p>yourself too much. We are both punished.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed</p>\n<p>eyes. “It is too late, Basil,” he faltered.</p>\n<p>“It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot</p>\n<p>remember a prayer. Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ‘Though your sins be</p>\n<p>as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”</p>",
        "<p>“Those words mean nothing to me now.”</p>\n<p>“Hush! Don’t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God!</p>\n<p>Don’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable</p>\n<p>feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had</p>\n<p>been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his</p>\n<p>ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred</p>",
        "<p>within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more</p>\n<p>than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He glanced wildly</p>\n<p>around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced</p>\n<p>him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a knife that he</p>\n<p>had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had</p>\n<p>forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing</p>\n<p>Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and</p>",
        "<p>turned round. Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.</p>\n<p>He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind</p>\n<p>the ear, crushing the man’s head down on the table and stabbing again</p>\n<p>and again.</p>\n<p>There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking</p>\n<p>with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,</p>\n<p>waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice</p>",
        "<p>more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the</p>\n<p>floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then he</p>\n<p>threw the knife on the table, and listened.</p>\n<p>He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He</p>\n<p>opened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely</p>\n<p>quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood bending over the</p>\n<p>balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.</p>",
        "<p>Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in</p>\n<p>as he did so.</p>\n<p>The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with</p>\n<p>bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been</p>\n<p>for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was</p>\n<p>slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was</p>\n<p>simply asleep.</p>",
        "<p>How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and walking</p>\n<p>over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind</p>\n<p>had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock’s</p>\n<p>tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He looked down and saw the</p>\n<p>policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on</p>\n<p>the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom</p>\n<p>gleamed at the corner and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl</p>",
        "<p>was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and</p>\n<p>then she stopped and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse</p>\n<p>voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She</p>\n<p>stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The</p>\n<p>gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their</p>\n<p>black iron branches to and fro. He shivered and went back, closing the</p>\n<p>window behind him.</p>",
        "<p>Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did not</p>\n<p>even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole</p>\n<p>thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted the</p>\n<p>fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his</p>\n<p>life. That was enough.</p>\n<p>Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish</p>\n<p>workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished</p>",
        "<p>steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed</p>\n<p>by his servant, and questions would be asked. He hesitated for a</p>\n<p>moment, then he turned back and took it from the table. He could not</p>\n<p>help seeing the dead thing. How still it was! How horribly white the</p>\n<p>long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image.</p>\n<p>Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. The</p>\n<p>woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped</p>",
        "<p>several times and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely the</p>\n<p>sound of his own footsteps.</p>\n<p>When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.</p>\n<p>They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was</p>\n<p>in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises,</p>\n<p>and put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he</p>\n<p>pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two.</p>",
        "<p>He sat down and began to think. Every year—every month, almost—men were</p>\n<p>strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of</p>\n<p>murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth....</p>\n<p>And yet, what evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left</p>\n<p>the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the</p>\n<p>servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to bed.... Paris! Yes.</p>\n<p>It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he</p>",
        "<p>had intended. With his curious reserved habits, it would be months</p>\n<p>before any suspicions would be roused. Months! Everything could be</p>\n<p>destroyed long before then.</p>\n<p>A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went</p>\n<p>out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the</p>\n<p>policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the</p>\n<p>bull’s-eye reflected in the window. He waited and held his breath.</p>",
        "<p>After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting</p>\n<p>the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In</p>\n<p>about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very</p>\n<p>drowsy.</p>\n<p>“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping in;</p>\n<p>“but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?”</p>\n<p>“Ten minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock and</p>",
        "<p>blinking.</p>\n<p>“Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine</p>\n<p>to-morrow. I have some work to do.”</p>\n<p>“All right, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Did any one call this evening?”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away</p>\n<p>to catch his train.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh! I am sorry I didn’t see him. Did he leave any message?”</p>\n<p>“No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not</p>\n<p>find you at the club.”</p>\n<p>“That will do, Francis. Don’t forget to call me at nine to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>“No, sir.”</p>\n<p>The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the</p>",
        "<p>library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room,</p>\n<p>biting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one</p>\n<p>of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. “Alan Campbell, 152,</p>\n<p>Hertford Street, Mayfair.” Yes; that was the man he wanted.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XIV</h3>\n<p>At nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of</p>\n<p>chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite</p>\n<p>peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his</p>\n<p>cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.</p>\n<p>The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as</p>\n<p>he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he</p>",
        "<p>had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all.</p>\n<p>His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But</p>\n<p>youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.</p>\n<p>He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his</p>\n<p>chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The</p>\n<p>sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost</p>\n<p>like a morning in May.</p>",
        "<p>Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,</p>\n<p>blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there</p>\n<p>with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had</p>\n<p>suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for</p>\n<p>Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came</p>\n<p>back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still</p>\n<p>sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was!</p>",
        "<p>Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.</p>\n<p>He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken</p>\n<p>or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory</p>\n<p>than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride</p>\n<p>more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of</p>\n<p>joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the</p>\n<p>senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out</p>",
        "<p>of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might</p>\n<p>strangle one itself.</p>\n<p>When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and</p>\n<p>then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual</p>\n<p>care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and</p>\n<p>scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once. He spent a long time</p>\n<p>also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet</p>",
        "<p>about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the</p>\n<p>servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence. At some of the</p>\n<p>letters, he smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times</p>\n<p>over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.</p>\n<p>“That awful thing, a woman’s memory!” as Lord Henry had once said.</p>\n<p>After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly</p>\n<p>with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the</p>",
        "<p>table, sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the</p>\n<p>other he handed to the valet.</p>\n<p>“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell</p>\n<p>is out of town, get his address.”</p>\n<p>As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a</p>\n<p>piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and</p>\n<p>then human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew</p>",
        "<p>seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and</p>\n<p>getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.</p>\n<p>He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until</p>\n<p>it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.</p>\n<p>When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page</p>\n<p>of the book. It was Gautier’s “Émaux et Camées”, Charpentier’s</p>\n<p>Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of</p>",
        "<p>citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted</p>\n<p>pomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he</p>\n<p>turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of</p>\n<p>Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand “_du supplice encore mal lavée_,” with</p>\n<p>its downy red hairs and its “_doigts de faune_.” He glanced at his own</p>\n<p>white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and</p>\n<p>passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:</p>",
        "<p>Sur une gamme chromatique,</p>\n<p>Le sein de perles ruisselant,</p>\n<p>La Vénus de l’Adriatique</p>\n<p>Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc.</p>\n<p>Les dômes, sur l’azur des ondes</p>\n<p>Suivant la phrase au pur contour,</p>\n<p>S’enflent comme des gorges rondes</p>",
        "<p>Que soulève un soupir d’amour.</p>\n<p>L’esquif aborde et me dépose,</p>\n<p>Jetant son amarre au pilier,</p>\n<p>Devant une façade rose,</p>\n<p>Sur le marbre d’un escalier.</p>\n<p>How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating</p>\n<p>down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black</p>",
        "<p>gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked</p>\n<p>to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as</p>\n<p>one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour reminded him</p>\n<p>of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the</p>\n<p>tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through</p>\n<p>the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he</p>\n<p>kept saying over and over to himself:</p>",
        "<p>“Devant une façade rose,</p>\n<p>Sur le marbre d’un escalier.”</p>\n<p>The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn</p>\n<p>that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to</p>\n<p>mad delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,</p>\n<p>like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true</p>\n<p>romantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had</p>",
        "<p>been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor</p>\n<p>Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die!</p>\n<p>He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read</p>\n<p>of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _café_ at Smyrna</p>\n<p>where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned</p>\n<p>merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each</p>\n<p>other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps</p>",
        "<p>tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by</p>\n<p>the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red</p>\n<p>ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small</p>\n<p>beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood</p>\n<p>over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell</p>\n<p>of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the</p>\n<p>“_monstre charmant_” that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.</p>",
        "<p>But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a</p>\n<p>horrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be</p>\n<p>out of England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he</p>\n<p>might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital</p>\n<p>importance.</p>\n<p>They had been great friends once, five years before—almost inseparable,</p>\n<p>indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in</p>",
        "<p>society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never</p>\n<p>did.</p>\n<p>He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real</p>\n<p>appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the</p>\n<p>beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His</p>\n<p>dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had</p>\n<p>spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken</p>",
        "<p>a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year. Indeed, he was</p>\n<p>still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his</p>\n<p>own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the</p>\n<p>annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for</p>\n<p>Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up</p>\n<p>prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and</p>\n<p>played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In</p>",
        "<p>fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray</p>\n<p>together—music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be</p>\n<p>able to exercise whenever he wished—and, indeed, exercised often</p>\n<p>without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire’s the</p>\n<p>night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always</p>\n<p>seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For</p>\n<p>eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at</p>",
        "<p>Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian</p>\n<p>Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in</p>\n<p>life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever</p>\n<p>knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they</p>\n<p>met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at</p>\n<p>which Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, too—was strangely</p>\n<p>melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and</p>",
        "<p>would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called</p>\n<p>upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in</p>\n<p>which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to</p>\n<p>become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice</p>\n<p>in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious</p>\n<p>experiments.</p>\n<p>This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept</p>",
        "<p>glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly</p>\n<p>agitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,</p>\n<p>looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides.</p>\n<p>His hands were curiously cold.</p>\n<p>The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with</p>\n<p>feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the</p>\n<p>jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew what was waiting</p>",
        "<p>for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands</p>\n<p>his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight</p>\n<p>and driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was useless. The brain</p>\n<p>had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made</p>\n<p>grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,</p>\n<p>danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving</p>\n<p>masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,</p>",
        "<p>slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being</p>\n<p>dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its</p>\n<p>grave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made him</p>\n<p>stone.</p>\n<p>At last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes</p>\n<p>upon him.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Campbell, sir,” said the man.</p>",
        "<p>A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back</p>\n<p>to his cheeks.</p>\n<p>“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.” He felt that he was himself</p>\n<p>again. His mood of cowardice had passed away.</p>\n<p>The man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,</p>\n<p>looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his</p>\n<p>coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.</p>",
        "<p>“Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.”</p>\n<p>“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it</p>\n<p>was a matter of life and death.” His voice was hard and cold. He spoke</p>\n<p>with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady</p>\n<p>searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the</p>\n<p>pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the</p>\n<p>gesture with which he had been greeted.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one</p>\n<p>person. Sit down.”</p>\n<p>Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The</p>\n<p>two men’s eyes met. In Dorian’s there was infinite pity. He knew that</p>\n<p>what he was going to do was dreadful.</p>\n<p>After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very</p>\n<p>quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he</p>",
        "<p>had sent for, “Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room</p>\n<p>to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.</p>\n<p>He has been dead ten hours now. Don’t stir, and don’t look at me like</p>\n<p>that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not</p>\n<p>concern you. What you have to do is this—”</p>\n<p>“Stop, Gray. I don’t want to know anything further. Whether what you</p>\n<p>have told me is true or not true doesn’t concern me. I entirely decline</p>",
        "<p>to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.</p>\n<p>They don’t interest me any more.”</p>\n<p>“Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest</p>\n<p>you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can’t help myself. You are</p>\n<p>the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the</p>\n<p>matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about</p>\n<p>chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What you</p>",
        "<p>have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs—to destroy it</p>\n<p>so that not a vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this person come</p>\n<p>into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in</p>\n<p>Paris. He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must</p>\n<p>be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and</p>\n<p>everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may</p>\n<p>scatter in the air.”</p>",
        "<p>“You are mad, Dorian.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”</p>\n<p>“You are mad, I tell you—mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to</p>\n<p>help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to</p>\n<p>do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril</p>\n<p>my reputation for you? What is it to me what devil’s work you are up</p>\n<p>to?”</p>",
        "<p>“It was suicide, Alan.”</p>\n<p>“I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy.”</p>\n<p>“Do you still refuse to do this for me?”</p>\n<p>“Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I</p>\n<p>don’t care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be</p>\n<p>sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of</p>\n<p>all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have</p>",
        "<p>thought you knew more about people’s characters. Your friend Lord Henry</p>\n<p>Wotton can’t have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he</p>\n<p>has taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You</p>\n<p>have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don’t come to</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>“Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don’t know what he had made me</p>\n<p>suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the</p>",
        "<p>marring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it, the</p>\n<p>result was the same.”</p>\n<p>“Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not</p>\n<p>inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in</p>\n<p>the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime</p>\n<p>without doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it.”</p>\n<p>“You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to</p>",
        "<p>me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain</p>\n<p>scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the</p>\n<p>horrors that you do there don’t affect you. If in some hideous</p>\n<p>dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a</p>\n<p>leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow</p>\n<p>through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You</p>\n<p>would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing</p>",
        "<p>anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were</p>\n<p>benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the</p>\n<p>world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.</p>\n<p>What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.</p>\n<p>Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are</p>\n<p>accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence</p>\n<p>against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be</p>",
        "<p>discovered unless you help me.”</p>\n<p>“I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent</p>\n<p>to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you</p>\n<p>came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some</p>\n<p>day. No! don’t think of that. Look at the matter purely from the</p>\n<p>scientific point of view. You don’t inquire where the dead things on</p>",
        "<p>which you experiment come from. Don’t inquire now. I have told you too</p>\n<p>much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once,</p>\n<p>Alan.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t speak about those days, Dorian—they are dead.”</p>\n<p>“The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is</p>\n<p>sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan!</p>\n<p>If you don’t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang</p>",
        "<p>me, Alan! Don’t you understand? They will hang me for what I have</p>\n<p>done.”</p>\n<p>“There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do</p>\n<p>anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me.”</p>\n<p>“You refuse?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“I entreat you, Alan.”</p>",
        "<p>“It is useless.”</p>\n<p>The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray’s eyes. Then he stretched</p>\n<p>out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read</p>\n<p>it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.</p>\n<p>Having done this, he got up and went over to the window.</p>\n<p>Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and</p>\n<p>opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back</p>",
        "<p>in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if</p>\n<p>his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.</p>\n<p>After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and</p>\n<p>came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.</p>\n<p>“I am so sorry for you, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me no</p>\n<p>alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the</p>\n<p>address. If you don’t help me, I must send it. If you don’t help me, I</p>",
        "<p>will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to</p>\n<p>help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you.</p>\n<p>You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh,</p>\n<p>offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me—no</p>\n<p>living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate</p>\n<p>terms.”</p>\n<p>Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through</p>",
        "<p>him.</p>\n<p>“Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The</p>\n<p>thing is quite simple. Come, don’t work yourself into this fever. The</p>\n<p>thing has to be done. Face it, and do it.”</p>\n<p>A groan broke from Campbell’s lips and he shivered all over. The</p>\n<p>ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing</p>\n<p>time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be</p>",
        "<p>borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his</p>\n<p>forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already</p>\n<p>come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.</p>\n<p>It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him.</p>\n<p>“Come, Alan, you must decide at once.”</p>\n<p>“I cannot do it,” he said, mechanically, as though words could alter</p>\n<p>things.</p>",
        "<p>“You must. You have no choice. Don’t delay.”</p>\n<p>He hesitated a moment. “Is there a fire in the room upstairs?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.”</p>\n<p>“I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.”</p>\n<p>“No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of</p>\n<p>notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the</p>\n<p>things back to you.”</p>",
        "<p>Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope</p>\n<p>to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then</p>\n<p>he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as</p>\n<p>soon as possible and to bring the things with him.</p>\n<p>As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up</p>\n<p>from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a</p>\n<p>kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A</p>",
        "<p>fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was</p>\n<p>like the beat of a hammer.</p>\n<p>As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian</p>\n<p>Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was something in</p>\n<p>the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him.</p>\n<p>“You are infamous, absolutely infamous!” he muttered.</p>\n<p>“Hush, Alan. You have saved my life,” said Dorian.</p>",
        "<p>“Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from</p>\n<p>corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In</p>\n<p>doing what I am going to do—what you force me to do—it is not of your</p>\n<p>life that I am thinking.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, Alan,” murmured Dorian with a sigh, “I wish you had a thousandth</p>\n<p>part of the pity for me that I have for you.” He turned away as he</p>\n<p>spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer.</p>",
        "<p>After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant</p>\n<p>entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil</p>\n<p>of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.</p>\n<p>“Shall I leave the things here, sir?” he asked Campbell.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Dorian. “And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another</p>\n<p>errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies</p>\n<p>Selby with orchids?”</p>",
        "<p>“Harden, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Yes—Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden</p>\n<p>personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,</p>\n<p>and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don’t want any</p>\n<p>white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty</p>\n<p>place—otherwise I wouldn’t bother you about it.”</p>\n<p>“No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?”</p>",
        "<p>Dorian looked at Campbell. “How long will your experiment take, Alan?”</p>\n<p>he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in</p>\n<p>the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.</p>\n<p>Campbell frowned and bit his lip. “It will take about five hours,” he</p>\n<p>answered.</p>\n<p>“It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,</p>\n<p>Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have</p>",
        "<p>the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room.</p>\n<p>“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!</p>\n<p>I’ll take it for you. You bring the other things.” He spoke rapidly and</p>\n<p>in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left</p>\n<p>the room together.</p>",
        "<p>When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned</p>\n<p>it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his</p>\n<p>eyes. He shuddered. “I don’t think I can go in, Alan,” he murmured.</p>\n<p>“It is nothing to me. I don’t require you,” said Campbell coldly.</p>\n<p>Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of his</p>\n<p>portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn</p>\n<p>curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he had</p>",
        "<p>forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,</p>\n<p>and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.</p>\n<p>What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on</p>\n<p>one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible</p>\n<p>it was!—more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent</p>\n<p>thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose</p>\n<p>grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had</p>",
        "<p>not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.</p>\n<p>He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with</p>\n<p>half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that</p>\n<p>he would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and</p>\n<p>taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the</p>\n<p>picture.</p>\n<p>There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed</p>",
        "<p>themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard</p>\n<p>Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other</p>\n<p>things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to wonder</p>\n<p>if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had</p>\n<p>thought of each other.</p>\n<p>“Leave me now,” said a stern voice behind him.</p>\n<p>He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been</p>",
        "<p>thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a</p>\n<p>glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs, he heard the key</p>\n<p>being turned in the lock.</p>\n<p>It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He</p>\n<p>was pale, but absolutely calm. “I have done what you asked me to do,”</p>\n<p>he muttered. “And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.”</p>\n<p>“You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,” said Dorian</p>",
        "<p>simply.</p>\n<p>As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible</p>\n<p>smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting</p>\n<p>at the table was gone.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XV</h3>\n<p>That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large</p>\n<p>button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady</p>\n<p>Narborough’s drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was</p>\n<p>throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his</p>\n<p>manner as he bent over his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as</p>\n<p>ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to</p>",
        "<p>play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could</p>\n<p>have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any</p>\n<p>tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have</p>\n<p>clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God</p>\n<p>and goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his</p>\n<p>demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a</p>\n<p>double life.</p>",
        "<p>It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who</p>\n<p>was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the</p>\n<p>remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife</p>\n<p>to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband</p>\n<p>properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and</p>\n<p>married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted</p>\n<p>herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and</p>",
        "<p>French _esprit_ when she could get it.</p>\n<p>Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that</p>\n<p>she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life. “I know, my</p>\n<p>dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,” she used to say,</p>\n<p>“and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most</p>\n<p>fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our</p>\n<p>bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to</p>",
        "<p>raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.</p>\n<p>However, that was all Narborough’s fault. He was dreadfully</p>\n<p>short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who</p>\n<p>never sees anything.”</p>\n<p>Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she</p>\n<p>explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married</p>\n<p>daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make</p>",
        "<p>matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. “I think it</p>\n<p>is most unkind of her, my dear,” she whispered. “Of course I go and</p>\n<p>stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old</p>\n<p>woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake</p>\n<p>them up. You don’t know what an existence they lead down there. It is</p>\n<p>pure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they have</p>\n<p>so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to</p>",
        "<p>think about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since</p>\n<p>the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep</p>\n<p>after dinner. You shan’t sit next either of them. You shall sit by me</p>\n<p>and amuse me.”</p>\n<p>Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes:</p>\n<p>it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had never seen</p>\n<p>before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those</p>",
        "<p>middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,</p>\n<p>but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an</p>\n<p>overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always</p>\n<p>trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to</p>\n<p>her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against</p>\n<p>her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and</p>\n<p>Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess’s daughter, a dowdy</p>",
        "<p>dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once</p>\n<p>seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,</p>\n<p>white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the</p>\n<p>impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of</p>\n<p>ideas.</p>\n<p>He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the</p>\n<p>great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the</p>",
        "<p>mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: “How horrid of Henry Wotton to be</p>\n<p>so late! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised</p>\n<p>faithfully not to disappoint me.”</p>\n<p>It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door</p>\n<p>opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some</p>\n<p>insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.</p>\n<p>But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away</p>",
        "<p>untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called “an</p>\n<p>insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,” and</p>\n<p>now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence</p>\n<p>and abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his glass</p>\n<p>with champagne. He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.</p>\n<p>“Dorian,” said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being</p>\n<p>handed round, “what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out</p>",
        "<p>of sorts.”</p>\n<p>“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that he is</p>\n<p>afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I</p>\n<p>certainly should.”</p>\n<p>“Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not been in</p>\n<p>love for a whole week—not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.”</p>\n<p>“How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old lady.</p>",
        "<p>“I really cannot understand it.”</p>\n<p>“It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,</p>\n<p>Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry. “She is the one link between us and</p>\n<p>your short frocks.”</p>\n<p>“She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I</p>\n<p>remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _décolletée_</p>\n<p>she was then.”</p>",
        "<p>“She is still _décolletée_,” he answered, taking an olive in his long</p>\n<p>fingers; “and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an</p>\n<p>_édition de luxe_ of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and</p>\n<p>full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.</p>\n<p>When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.”</p>\n<p>“How can you, Harry!” cried Dorian.</p>\n<p>“It is a most romantic explanation,” laughed the hostess. “But her</p>",
        "<p>third husband, Lord Henry! You don’t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly, Lady Narborough.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe a word of it.”</p>\n<p>“Well, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends.”</p>\n<p>“Is it true, Mr. Gray?”</p>\n<p>“She assures me so, Lady Narborough,” said Dorian. “I asked her</p>\n<p>whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and</p>",
        "<p>hung at her girdle. She told me she didn’t, because none of them had</p>\n<p>had any hearts at all.”</p>\n<p>“Four husbands! Upon my word that is _trop de zêle_.”</p>\n<p>“_Trop d’audace_, I tell her,” said Dorian.</p>\n<p>“Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol</p>\n<p>like? I don’t know him.”</p>\n<p>“The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,”</p>",
        "<p>said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.</p>\n<p>Lady Narborough hit him with her fan. “Lord Henry, I am not at all</p>\n<p>surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.”</p>\n<p>“But what world says that?” asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>“It can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent</p>\n<p>terms.”</p>\n<p>“Everybody I know says you are very wicked,” cried the old lady,</p>",
        "<p>shaking her head.</p>\n<p>Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. “It is perfectly</p>\n<p>monstrous,” he said, at last, “the way people go about nowadays saying</p>\n<p>things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely</p>\n<p>true.”</p>\n<p>“Isn’t he incorrigible?” cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.</p>\n<p>“I hope so,” said his hostess, laughing. “But really, if you all</p>",
        "<p>worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry</p>\n<p>again so as to be in the fashion.”</p>\n<p>“You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,” broke in Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she</p>\n<p>detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he</p>\n<p>adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.”</p>\n<p>“Narborough wasn’t perfect,” cried the old lady.</p>",
        "<p>“If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,” was the</p>\n<p>rejoinder. “Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,</p>\n<p>they will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never</p>\n<p>ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough,</p>\n<p>but it is quite true.”</p>\n<p>“Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for</p>\n<p>your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be</p>",
        "<p>married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however,</p>\n<p>that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like</p>\n<p>bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.”</p>\n<p>“_Fin de siêcle_,” murmured Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“_Fin du globe_,” answered his hostess.</p>\n<p>“I wish it were _fin du globe_,” said Dorian with a sigh. “Life is a</p>\n<p>great disappointment.”</p>",
        "<p>“Ah, my dear,” cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, “don’t</p>\n<p>tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that one knows</p>\n<p>that life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes</p>\n<p>wish that I had been; but you are made to be good—you look so good. I</p>\n<p>must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don’t you think that Mr. Gray</p>\n<p>should get married?”</p>\n<p>“I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry with a</p>",
        "<p>bow.</p>\n<p>“Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go</p>\n<p>through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the</p>\n<p>eligible young ladies.”</p>\n<p>“With their ages, Lady Narborough?” asked Dorian.</p>\n<p>“Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done</p>\n<p>in a hurry. I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable</p>",
        "<p>alliance, and I want you both to be happy.”</p>\n<p>“What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!” exclaimed Lord</p>\n<p>Henry. “A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love</p>\n<p>her.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! what a cynic you are!” cried the old lady, pushing back her chair</p>\n<p>and nodding to Lady Ruxton. “You must come and dine with me soon again.</p>\n<p>You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew</p>",
        "<p>prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like to meet,</p>\n<p>though. I want it to be a delightful gathering.”</p>\n<p>“I like men who have a future and women who have a past,” he answered.</p>\n<p>“Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?”</p>\n<p>“I fear so,” she said, laughing, as she stood up. “A thousand pardons,</p>\n<p>my dear Lady Ruxton,” she added, “I didn’t see you hadn’t finished your</p>\n<p>cigarette.”</p>",
        "<p>“Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am going</p>\n<p>to limit myself, for the future.”</p>\n<p>“Pray don’t, Lady Ruxton,” said Lord Henry. “Moderation is a fatal</p>\n<p>thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a</p>\n<p>feast.”</p>\n<p>Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. “You must come and explain that</p>\n<p>to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,” she</p>",
        "<p>murmured, as she swept out of the room.</p>\n<p>“Now, mind you don’t stay too long over your politics and scandal,”</p>\n<p>cried Lady Narborough from the door. “If you do, we are sure to</p>\n<p>squabble upstairs.”</p>\n<p>The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the</p>\n<p>table and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and</p>\n<p>sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the</p>",
        "<p>situation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The</p>\n<p>word _doctrinaire_—word full of terror to the British mind—reappeared</p>\n<p>from time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix served</p>\n<p>as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles</p>\n<p>of thought. The inherited stupidity of the race—sound English common</p>\n<p>sense he jovially termed it—was shown to be the proper bulwark for</p>\n<p>society.</p>",
        "<p>A smile curved Lord Henry’s lips, and he turned round and looked at</p>\n<p>Dorian.</p>\n<p>“Are you better, my dear fellow?” he asked. “You seemed rather out of</p>\n<p>sorts at dinner.”</p>\n<p>“I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.”</p>\n<p>“You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to</p>\n<p>you. She tells me she is going down to Selby.”</p>",
        "<p>“She has promised to come on the twentieth.”</p>\n<p>“Is Monmouth to be there, too?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, Harry.”</p>\n<p>“He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very</p>\n<p>clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of</p>\n<p>weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image</p>\n<p>precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.</p>",
        "<p>White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and</p>\n<p>what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences.”</p>\n<p>“How long has she been married?” asked Dorian.</p>\n<p>“An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is</p>\n<p>ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,</p>\n<p>with time thrown in. Who else is coming?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey</p>",
        "<p>Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.”</p>\n<p>“I like him,” said Lord Henry. “A great many people don’t, but I find</p>\n<p>him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by</p>\n<p>being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go to</p>\n<p>Monte Carlo with his father.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! what a nuisance people’s people are! Try and make him come. By the</p>",
        "<p>way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven.</p>\n<p>What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?”</p>\n<p>Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.</p>\n<p>“No, Harry,” he said at last, “I did not get home till nearly three.”</p>\n<p>“Did you go to the club?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” he answered. Then he bit his lip. “No, I don’t mean that. I</p>\n<p>didn’t go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How</p>",
        "<p>inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been</p>\n<p>doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at</p>\n<p>half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my</p>\n<p>latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any</p>\n<p>corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let</p>\n<p>us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.</p>",
        "<p>Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not</p>\n<p>yourself to-night.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come</p>\n<p>round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady</p>\n<p>Narborough. I shan’t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.”</p>\n<p>“All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.</p>\n<p>The duchess is coming.”</p>",
        "<p>“I will try to be there, Harry,” he said, leaving the room. As he drove</p>\n<p>back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he</p>\n<p>thought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord Henry’s casual</p>\n<p>questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted</p>\n<p>his nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He</p>\n<p>winced. He hated the idea of even touching them.</p>\n<p>Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the</p>",
        "<p>door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had</p>\n<p>thrust Basil Hallward’s coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He piled</p>\n<p>another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning</p>\n<p>leather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume</p>\n<p>everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some</p>\n<p>Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and</p>\n<p>forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.</p>",
        "<p>Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed</p>\n<p>nervously at his underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large</p>\n<p>Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue</p>\n<p>lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and</p>\n<p>make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet</p>\n<p>almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He</p>\n<p>lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the</p>",
        "<p>long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the</p>\n<p>cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying,</p>\n<p>went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A</p>\n<p>triangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively</p>\n<p>towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese</p>\n<p>box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides</p>\n<p>patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round</p>",
        "<p>crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside</p>\n<p>was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and</p>\n<p>persistent.</p>\n<p>He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his</p>\n<p>face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly</p>\n<p>hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes</p>\n<p>to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did</p>",
        "<p>so, and went into his bedroom.</p>\n<p>As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,</p>\n<p>dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept</p>\n<p>quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good</p>\n<p>horse. He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.</p>\n<p>The man shook his head. “It is too far for me,” he muttered.</p>\n<p>“Here is a sovereign for you,” said Dorian. “You shall have another if</p>",
        "<p>you drive fast.”</p>\n<p>“All right, sir,” answered the man, “you will be there in an hour,” and</p>\n<p>after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly</p>\n<p>towards the river.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XVI</h3>\n<p>A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly</p>\n<p>in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men</p>\n<p>and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From some</p>\n<p>of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards</p>\n<p>brawled and screamed.</p>\n<p>Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian</p>",
        "<p>Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and</p>\n<p>now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said</p>\n<p>to him on the first day they had met, “To cure the soul by means of the</p>\n<p>senses, and the senses by means of the soul.” Yes, that was the secret.</p>\n<p>He had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium</p>\n<p>dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of</p>\n<p>old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.</p>",
        "<p>The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a</p>\n<p>huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The</p>\n<p>gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the</p>\n<p>man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from</p>\n<p>the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom</p>\n<p>were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.</p>\n<p>“To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of</p>",
        "<p>the soul!” How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was</p>\n<p>sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent</p>\n<p>blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there</p>\n<p>was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness</p>\n<p>was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing</p>\n<p>out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.</p>\n<p>Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who</p>",
        "<p>had made him a judge over others? He had said things that were</p>\n<p>dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.</p>\n<p>On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each</p>\n<p>step. He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The</p>\n<p>hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and</p>\n<p>his delicate hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse</p>\n<p>madly with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in</p>",
        "<p>answer, and the man was silent.</p>\n<p>The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some</p>\n<p>sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist</p>\n<p>thickened, he felt afraid.</p>\n<p>Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and</p>\n<p>he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,</p>\n<p>fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in</p>",
        "<p>the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a</p>\n<p>rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.</p>\n<p>After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over</p>\n<p>rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then</p>\n<p>fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind. He</p>\n<p>watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made</p>\n<p>gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in his heart.</p>",
        "<p>As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open</p>\n<p>door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards. The</p>\n<p>driver beat at them with his whip.</p>\n<p>It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with</p>\n<p>hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped</p>\n<p>those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in</p>\n<p>them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by</p>",
        "<p>intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would</p>\n<p>still have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept</p>\n<p>the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all</p>\n<p>man’s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.</p>\n<p>Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,</p>\n<p>became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one</p>\n<p>reality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of</p>",
        "<p>disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more</p>\n<p>vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious</p>\n<p>shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he needed for</p>\n<p>forgetfulness. In three days he would be free.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over</p>\n<p>the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black</p>\n<p>masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the</p>",
        "<p>yards.</p>\n<p>“Somewhere about here, sir, ain’t it?” he asked huskily through the</p>\n<p>trap.</p>\n<p>Dorian started and peered round. “This will do,” he answered, and</p>\n<p>having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had</p>\n<p>promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and</p>\n<p>there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The</p>",
        "<p>light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an</p>\n<p>outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like</p>\n<p>a wet mackintosh.</p>\n<p>He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he</p>\n<p>was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small</p>\n<p>shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of</p>\n<p>the top-windows stood a lamp. He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.</p>",
        "<p>After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being</p>\n<p>unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word</p>\n<p>to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as</p>\n<p>he passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that</p>\n<p>swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the</p>\n<p>street. He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as</p>\n<p>if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring</p>",
        "<p>gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced</p>\n<p>them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin</p>\n<p>backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered</p>\n<p>with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and</p>\n<p>stained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching</p>\n<p>by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing</p>\n<p>their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his head</p>",
        "<p>buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily</p>\n<p>painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women,</p>\n<p>mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an</p>\n<p>expression of disgust. “He thinks he’s got red ants on him,” laughed</p>\n<p>one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in terror and</p>\n<p>began to whimper.</p>\n<p>At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a</p>",
        "<p>darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the</p>\n<p>heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils</p>\n<p>quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow</p>\n<p>hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up</p>\n<p>at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.</p>\n<p>“You here, Adrian?” muttered Dorian.</p>\n<p>“Where else should I be?” he answered, listlessly. “None of the chaps</p>",
        "<p>will speak to me now.”</p>\n<p>“I thought you had left England.”</p>\n<p>“Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at</p>\n<p>last. George doesn’t speak to me either.... I don’t care,” he added</p>\n<p>with a sigh. “As long as one has this stuff, one doesn’t want friends.</p>\n<p>I think I have had too many friends.”</p>\n<p>Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such</p>",
        "<p>fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the</p>\n<p>gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in</p>\n<p>what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were</p>\n<p>teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he</p>\n<p>was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was</p>\n<p>eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of</p>\n<p>Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The</p>",
        "<p>presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where no one</p>\n<p>would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.</p>\n<p>“I am going on to the other place,” he said after a pause.</p>\n<p>“On the wharf?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won’t have her in this place</p>\n<p>now.”</p>",
        "<p>Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I am sick of women who love one. Women</p>\n<p>who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better.”</p>\n<p>“Much the same.”</p>\n<p>“I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have</p>\n<p>something.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want anything,” murmured the young man.</p>\n<p>“Never mind.”</p>",
        "<p>Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A</p>\n<p>half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous</p>\n<p>greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of</p>\n<p>them. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian turned his back</p>\n<p>on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.</p>\n<p>A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of</p>\n<p>the women. “We are very proud to-night,” she sneered.</p>",
        "<p>“For God’s sake don’t talk to me,” cried Dorian, stamping his foot on</p>\n<p>the ground. “What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don’t ever talk to me</p>\n<p>again.”</p>\n<p>Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman’s sodden eyes, then</p>\n<p>flickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her head and</p>\n<p>raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her companion</p>\n<p>watched her enviously.</p>",
        "<p>“It’s no use,” sighed Adrian Singleton. “I don’t care to go back. What</p>\n<p>does it matter? I am quite happy here.”</p>\n<p>“You will write to me if you want anything, won’t you?” said Dorian,</p>\n<p>after a pause.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps.”</p>\n<p>“Good night, then.”</p>\n<p>“Good night,” answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping</p>",
        "<p>his parched mouth with a handkerchief.</p>\n<p>Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he drew</p>\n<p>the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the</p>\n<p>woman who had taken his money. “There goes the devil’s bargain!” she</p>\n<p>hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.</p>\n<p>“Curse you!” he answered, “don’t call me that.”</p>\n<p>She snapped her fingers. “Prince Charming is what you like to be</p>",
        "<p>called, ain’t it?” she yelled after him.</p>\n<p>The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly</p>\n<p>round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear. He</p>\n<p>rushed out as if in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His</p>\n<p>meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered</p>\n<p>if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as</p>",
        "<p>Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult. He bit his</p>\n<p>lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what did</p>\n<p>it matter to him? One’s days were too brief to take the burden of</p>\n<p>another’s errors on one’s shoulders. Each man lived his own life and</p>\n<p>paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so</p>\n<p>often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed.</p>\n<p>In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.</p>",
        "<p>There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or</p>\n<p>for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of</p>\n<p>the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful</p>\n<p>impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.</p>\n<p>They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken</p>\n<p>from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all,</p>\n<p>lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.</p>",
        "<p>For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of</p>\n<p>disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell</p>\n<p>from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.</p>\n<p>Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for</p>\n<p>rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but</p>\n<p>as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a</p>\n<p>short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself</p>",
        "<p>suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself,</p>\n<p>he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his</p>\n<p>throat.</p>\n<p>He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the</p>\n<p>tightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a revolver,</p>\n<p>and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head,</p>\n<p>and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.</p>",
        "<p>“What do you want?” he gasped.</p>\n<p>“Keep quiet,” said the man. “If you stir, I shoot you.”</p>\n<p>“You are mad. What have I done to you?”</p>\n<p>“You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,” was the answer, “and Sibyl Vane</p>\n<p>was my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at your</p>\n<p>door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought you.</p>\n<p>I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have described you</p>",
        "<p>were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.</p>\n<p>I heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace with God, for to-night</p>\n<p>you are going to die.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. “I never knew her,” he stammered. “I</p>\n<p>never heard of her. You are mad.”</p>\n<p>“You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you</p>\n<p>are going to die.” There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know</p>",
        "<p>what to say or do. “Down on your knees!” growled the man. “I give you</p>\n<p>one minute to make your peace—no more. I go on board to-night for</p>\n<p>India, and I must do my job first. One minute. That’s all.”</p>\n<p>Dorian’s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know</p>\n<p>what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. “Stop,” he</p>\n<p>cried. “How long ago is it since your sister died? Quick, tell me!”</p>\n<p>“Eighteen years,” said the man. “Why do you ask me? What do years</p>",
        "<p>matter?”</p>\n<p>“Eighteen years,” laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his</p>\n<p>voice. “Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!”</p>\n<p>James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.</p>\n<p>Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.</p>\n<p>Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him</p>\n<p>the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face</p>",
        "<p>of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the</p>\n<p>unstained purity of youth. He seemed little more than a lad of twenty</p>\n<p>summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been</p>\n<p>when they had parted so many years ago. It was obvious that this was</p>\n<p>not the man who had destroyed her life.</p>\n<p>He loosened his hold and reeled back. “My God! my God!” he cried, “and</p>\n<p>I would have murdered you!”</p>",
        "<p>Dorian Gray drew a long breath. “You have been on the brink of</p>\n<p>committing a terrible crime, my man,” he said, looking at him sternly.</p>\n<p>“Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own</p>\n<p>hands.”</p>\n<p>“Forgive me, sir,” muttered James Vane. “I was deceived. A chance word</p>\n<p>I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.”</p>\n<p>“You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into</p>",
        "<p>trouble,” said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the</p>\n<p>street.</p>\n<p>James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from head</p>\n<p>to foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping</p>\n<p>along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him</p>\n<p>with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked</p>\n<p>round with a start. It was one of the women who had been drinking at</p>",
        "<p>the bar.</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t you kill him?” she hissed out, putting haggard face quite</p>\n<p>close to his. “I knew you were following him when you rushed out from</p>\n<p>Daly’s. You fool! You should have killed him. He has lots of money, and</p>\n<p>he’s as bad as bad.”</p>\n<p>“He is not the man I am looking for,” he answered, “and I want no man’s</p>\n<p>money. I want a man’s life. The man whose life I want must be nearly</p>",
        "<p>forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have not</p>\n<p>got his blood upon my hands.”</p>\n<p>The woman gave a bitter laugh. “Little more than a boy!” she sneered.</p>\n<p>“Why, man, it’s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me</p>\n<p>what I am.”</p>\n<p>“You lie!” cried James Vane.</p>\n<p>She raised her hand up to heaven. “Before God I am telling the truth,”</p>",
        "<p>she cried.</p>\n<p>“Before God?”</p>\n<p>“Strike me dumb if it ain’t so. He is the worst one that comes here.</p>\n<p>They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It’s nigh</p>\n<p>on eighteen years since I met him. He hasn’t changed much since then. I</p>\n<p>have, though,” she added, with a sickly leer.</p>\n<p>“You swear this?”</p>",
        "<p>“I swear it,” came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth. “But don’t give</p>\n<p>me away to him,” she whined; “I am afraid of him. Let me have some</p>\n<p>money for my night’s lodging.”</p>\n<p>He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street,</p>\n<p>but Dorian Gray had disappeared. When he looked back, the woman had</p>\n<p>vanished also.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XVII</h3>\n<p>A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby</p>\n<p>Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,</p>\n<p>a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea-time,</p>\n<p>and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the</p>\n<p>table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at</p>\n<p>which the duchess was presiding. Her white hands were moving daintily</p>",
        "<p>among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that</p>\n<p>Dorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped</p>\n<p>wicker chair, looking at them. On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady</p>\n<p>Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke’s description of the last</p>\n<p>Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection. Three young men</p>\n<p>in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.</p>\n<p>The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more</p>",
        "<p>expected to arrive on the next day.</p>\n<p>“What are you two talking about?” said Lord Henry, strolling over to</p>\n<p>the table and putting his cup down. “I hope Dorian has told you about</p>\n<p>my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.”</p>\n<p>“But I don’t want to be rechristened, Harry,” rejoined the duchess,</p>\n<p>looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. “I am quite satisfied with</p>\n<p>my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.”</p>",
        "<p>“My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are</p>\n<p>both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an</p>\n<p>orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as</p>\n<p>effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one</p>\n<p>of the gardeners what it was called. He told me it was a fine specimen</p>\n<p>of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. It is a sad</p>\n<p>truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.</p>",
        "<p>Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is</p>\n<p>with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The</p>\n<p>man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It</p>\n<p>is the only thing he is fit for.”</p>\n<p>“Then what should we call you, Harry?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“His name is Prince Paradox,” said Dorian.</p>\n<p>“I recognize him in a flash,” exclaimed the duchess.</p>",
        "<p>“I won’t hear of it,” laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair. “From a</p>\n<p>label there is no escape! I refuse the title.”</p>\n<p>“Royalties may not abdicate,” fell as a warning from pretty lips.</p>\n<p>“You wish me to defend my throne, then?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“I give the truths of to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>“I prefer the mistakes of to-day,” she answered.</p>",
        "<p>“You disarm me, Gladys,” he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.</p>\n<p>“Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.”</p>\n<p>“I never tilt against beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand.</p>\n<p>“That is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too much.”</p>\n<p>“How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be</p>\n<p>beautiful than to be good. But on the other hand, no one is more ready</p>\n<p>than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.”</p>",
        "<p>“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?” cried the duchess.</p>\n<p>“What becomes of your simile about the orchid?”</p>\n<p>“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good</p>\n<p>Tory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly</p>\n<p>virtues have made our England what she is.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t like your country, then?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“I live in it.”</p>",
        "<p>“That you may censure it the better.”</p>\n<p>“Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?” he inquired.</p>\n<p>“What do they say of us?”</p>\n<p>“That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.”</p>\n<p>“Is that yours, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“I give it to you.”</p>\n<p>“I could not use it. It is too true.”</p>",
        "<p>“You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description.”</p>\n<p>“They are practical.”</p>\n<p>“They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger,</p>\n<p>they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.”</p>\n<p>“Still, we have done great things.”</p>\n<p>“Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.”</p>\n<p>“We have carried their burden.”</p>",
        "<p>“Only as far as the Stock Exchange.”</p>\n<p>She shook her head. “I believe in the race,” she cried.</p>\n<p>“It represents the survival of the pushing.”</p>\n<p>“It has development.”</p>\n<p>“Decay fascinates me more.”</p>\n<p>“What of art?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“It is a malady.”</p>",
        "<p>“Love?”</p>\n<p>“An illusion.”</p>\n<p>“Religion?”</p>\n<p>“The fashionable substitute for belief.”</p>\n<p>“You are a sceptic.”</p>\n<p>“Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.”</p>\n<p>“What are you?”</p>",
        "<p>“To define is to limit.”</p>\n<p>“Give me a clue.”</p>\n<p>“Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.”</p>\n<p>“You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.”</p>\n<p>“Our host is a delightful topic. Years ago he was christened Prince</p>\n<p>Charming.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! don’t remind me of that,” cried Dorian Gray.</p>",
        "<p>“Our host is rather horrid this evening,” answered the duchess,</p>\n<p>colouring. “I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely</p>\n<p>scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern</p>\n<p>butterfly.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I hope he won’t stick pins into you, Duchess,” laughed Dorian.</p>\n<p>“Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.”</p>\n<p>“And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?”</p>",
        "<p>“For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I</p>\n<p>come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by</p>\n<p>half-past eight.”</p>\n<p>“How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning.”</p>\n<p>“I daren’t, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember the</p>\n<p>one I wore at Lady Hilstone’s garden-party? You don’t, but it is nice</p>\n<p>of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of nothing. All</p>",
        "<p>good hats are made out of nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Like all good reputations, Gladys,” interrupted Lord Henry. “Every</p>\n<p>effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be</p>\n<p>a mediocrity.”</p>\n<p>“Not with women,” said the duchess, shaking her head; “and women rule</p>\n<p>the world. I assure you we can’t bear mediocrities. We women, as some</p>\n<p>one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if</p>",
        "<p>you ever love at all.”</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that we never do anything else,” murmured Dorian.</p>\n<p>“Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,” answered the duchess with</p>\n<p>mock sadness.</p>\n<p>“My dear Gladys!” cried Lord Henry. “How can you say that? Romance</p>\n<p>lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.</p>\n<p>Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.</p>",
        "<p>Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely</p>\n<p>intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best,</p>\n<p>and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as</p>\n<p>possible.”</p>\n<p>“Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?” asked the duchess after</p>\n<p>a pause.</p>\n<p>“Especially when one has been wounded by it,” answered Lord Henry.</p>",
        "<p>The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression</p>\n<p>in her eyes. “What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?” she inquired.</p>\n<p>Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and laughed.</p>\n<p>“I always agree with Harry, Duchess.”</p>\n<p>“Even when he is wrong?”</p>\n<p>“Harry is never wrong, Duchess.”</p>\n<p>“And does his philosophy make you happy?”</p>",
        "<p>“I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have</p>\n<p>searched for pleasure.”</p>\n<p>“And found it, Mr. Gray?”</p>\n<p>“Often. Too often.”</p>\n<p>The duchess sighed. “I am searching for peace,” she said, “and if I</p>\n<p>don’t go and dress, I shall have none this evening.”</p>\n<p>“Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,” cried Dorian, starting to his</p>",
        "<p>feet and walking down the conservatory.</p>\n<p>“You are flirting disgracefully with him,” said Lord Henry to his</p>\n<p>cousin. “You had better take care. He is very fascinating.”</p>\n<p>“If he were not, there would be no battle.”</p>\n<p>“Greek meets Greek, then?”</p>\n<p>“I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.”</p>\n<p>“They were defeated.”</p>",
        "<p>“There are worse things than capture,” she answered.</p>\n<p>“You gallop with a loose rein.”</p>\n<p>“Pace gives life,” was the _riposte_.</p>\n<p>“I shall write it in my diary to-night.”</p>\n<p>“What?”</p>\n<p>“That a burnt child loves the fire.”</p>\n<p>“I am not even singed. My wings are untouched.”</p>",
        "<p>“You use them for everything, except flight.”</p>\n<p>“Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for us.”</p>\n<p>“You have a rival.”</p>\n<p>“Who?”</p>\n<p>He laughed. “Lady Narborough,” he whispered. “She perfectly adores</p>\n<p>him.”</p>\n<p>“You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us</p>",
        "<p>who are romanticists.”</p>\n<p>“Romanticists! You have all the methods of science.”</p>\n<p>“Men have educated us.”</p>\n<p>“But not explained you.”</p>\n<p>“Describe us as a sex,” was her challenge.</p>\n<p>“Sphinxes without secrets.”</p>\n<p>She looked at him, smiling. “How long Mr. Gray is!” she said. “Let us</p>",
        "<p>go and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.”</p>\n<p>“That would be a premature surrender.”</p>\n<p>“Romantic art begins with its climax.”</p>\n<p>“I must keep an opportunity for retreat.”</p>\n<p>“In the Parthian manner?”</p>\n<p>“They found safety in the desert. I could not do that.”</p>",
        "<p>“Women are not always allowed a choice,” he answered, but hardly had he</p>\n<p>finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came</p>\n<p>a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody</p>\n<p>started up. The duchess stood motionless in horror. And with fear in</p>\n<p>his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian</p>\n<p>Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.</p>\n<p>He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of</p>",
        "<p>the sofas. After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with</p>\n<p>a dazed expression.</p>\n<p>“What has happened?” he asked. “Oh! I remember. Am I safe here, Harry?”</p>\n<p>He began to tremble.</p>\n<p>“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, “you merely fainted. That was</p>\n<p>all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to</p>\n<p>dinner. I will take your place.”</p>",
        "<p>“No, I will come down,” he said, struggling to his feet. “I would</p>\n<p>rather come down. I must not be alone.”</p>\n<p>He went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of</p>\n<p>gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of</p>\n<p>terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the</p>\n<p>window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the</p>\n<p>face of James Vane watching him.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XVIII</h3>\n<p>The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the</p>\n<p>time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet</p>\n<p>indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,</p>\n<p>tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but</p>\n<p>tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against</p>\n<p>the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild</p>",
        "<p>regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor’s face</p>\n<p>peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to</p>\n<p>lay its hand upon his heart.</p>\n<p>But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of</p>\n<p>the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual</p>\n<p>life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the</p>\n<p>imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of</p>",
        "<p>sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen</p>\n<p>brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor</p>\n<p>the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon</p>\n<p>the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling round</p>\n<p>the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers. Had</p>\n<p>any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have</p>\n<p>reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane’s brother had</p>",
        "<p>not come back to kill him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in</p>\n<p>some winter sea. From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did</p>\n<p>not know who he was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had</p>\n<p>saved him.</p>\n<p>And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think</p>\n<p>that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them</p>\n<p>visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would</p>",
        "<p>his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from</p>\n<p>silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear</p>\n<p>as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!</p>\n<p>As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and</p>\n<p>the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a</p>\n<p>wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere</p>\n<p>memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back</p>",
        "<p>to him with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and</p>\n<p>swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in</p>\n<p>at six o’clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.</p>\n<p>It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was</p>\n<p>something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that</p>\n<p>seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it</p>\n<p>was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused</p>",
        "<p>the change. His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish</p>\n<p>that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle</p>\n<p>and finely wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions</p>\n<p>must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves</p>\n<p>die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows</p>\n<p>that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had</p>\n<p>convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken</p>",
        "<p>imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity</p>\n<p>and not a little of contempt.</p>\n<p>After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden</p>\n<p>and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp</p>\n<p>frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of blue</p>\n<p>metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.</p>\n<p>At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey</p>",
        "<p>Clouston, the duchess’s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of</p>\n<p>his gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the</p>\n<p>mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken</p>\n<p>and rough undergrowth.</p>\n<p>“Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the</p>\n<p>open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new</p>",
        "<p>ground.”</p>\n<p>Dorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and</p>\n<p>red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters</p>\n<p>ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that</p>\n<p>followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful</p>\n<p>freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high</p>\n<p>indifference of joy.</p>",
        "<p>Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front</p>\n<p>of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it</p>\n<p>forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir</p>\n<p>Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the</p>\n<p>animal’s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he</p>\n<p>cried out at once, “Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.”</p>\n<p>“What nonsense, Dorian!” laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded</p>",
        "<p>into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a</p>\n<p>hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is</p>\n<p>worse.</p>\n<p>“Good heavens! I have hit a beater!” exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. “What an</p>\n<p>ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!” he</p>\n<p>called out at the top of his voice. “A man is hurt.”</p>\n<p>The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.</p>",
        "<p>“Where, sir? Where is he?” he shouted. At the same time, the firing</p>\n<p>ceased along the line.</p>\n<p>“Here,” answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.</p>\n<p>“Why on earth don’t you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the</p>\n<p>day.”</p>\n<p>Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the</p>\n<p>lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging</p>",
        "<p>a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It</p>\n<p>seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went. He heard Sir</p>\n<p>Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of</p>\n<p>the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with</p>\n<p>faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of</p>\n<p>voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the</p>\n<p>boughs overhead.</p>",
        "<p>After a few moments—that were to him, in his perturbed state, like</p>\n<p>endless hours of pain—he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started</p>\n<p>and looked round.</p>\n<p>“Dorian,” said Lord Henry, “I had better tell them that the shooting is</p>\n<p>stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.”</p>\n<p>“I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,” he answered bitterly. “The</p>\n<p>whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?”</p>",
        "<p>He could not finish the sentence.</p>\n<p>“I am afraid so,” rejoined Lord Henry. “He got the whole charge of shot</p>\n<p>in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go</p>\n<p>home.”</p>\n<p>They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly</p>\n<p>fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and</p>\n<p>said, with a heavy sigh, “It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.”</p>",
        "<p>“What is?” asked Lord Henry. “Oh! this accident, I suppose. My dear</p>\n<p>fellow, it can’t be helped. It was the man’s own fault. Why did he get</p>\n<p>in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather</p>\n<p>awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It</p>\n<p>makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he</p>\n<p>shoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the matter.”</p>\n<p>Dorian shook his head. “It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if something</p>",
        "<p>horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,” he</p>\n<p>added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.</p>\n<p>The elder man laughed. “The only horrible thing in the world is</p>\n<p>_ennui_, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.</p>\n<p>But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep</p>\n<p>chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the</p>\n<p>subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an</p>",
        "<p>omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel</p>\n<p>for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have</p>\n<p>everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would</p>\n<p>not be delighted to change places with you.”</p>\n<p>“There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don’t</p>\n<p>laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who</p>\n<p>has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is</p>",
        "<p>the coming of death that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to</p>\n<p>wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don’t you see a man</p>\n<p>moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand</p>\n<p>was pointing. “Yes,” he said, smiling, “I see the gardener waiting for</p>\n<p>you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the</p>\n<p>table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must</p>",
        "<p>come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.”</p>\n<p>Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching. The</p>\n<p>man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating</p>\n<p>manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master. “Her</p>\n<p>Grace told me to wait for an answer,” he murmured.</p>\n<p>Dorian put the letter into his pocket. “Tell her Grace that I am coming</p>\n<p>in,” he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in the</p>",
        "<p>direction of the house.</p>\n<p>“How fond women are of doing dangerous things!” laughed Lord Henry. “It</p>\n<p>is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt</p>\n<p>with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.”</p>\n<p>“How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present</p>\n<p>instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I</p>\n<p>don’t love her.”</p>",
        "<p>“And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you</p>\n<p>are excellently matched.”</p>\n<p>“You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for</p>\n<p>scandal.”</p>\n<p>“The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,” said Lord Henry,</p>\n<p>lighting a cigarette.</p>\n<p>“You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.”</p>",
        "<p>“The world goes to the altar of its own accord,” was the answer.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could love,” cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in</p>\n<p>his voice. “But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the</p>\n<p>desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has</p>\n<p>become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was</p>\n<p>silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to</p>\n<p>Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe.”</p>",
        "<p>“Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what</p>\n<p>it is? You know I would help you.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t tell you, Harry,” he answered sadly. “And I dare say it is</p>\n<p>only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a</p>\n<p>horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.”</p>\n<p>“What nonsense!”</p>\n<p>“I hope it is, but I can’t help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess,</p>",
        "<p>looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come back,</p>\n<p>Duchess.”</p>\n<p>“I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,” she answered. “Poor Geoffrey is</p>\n<p>terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.</p>\n<p>How curious!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it was very curious. I don’t know what made me say it. Some whim,</p>\n<p>I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am</p>",
        "<p>sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.”</p>\n<p>“It is an annoying subject,” broke in Lord Henry. “It has no</p>\n<p>psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on</p>\n<p>purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some one</p>\n<p>who had committed a real murder.”</p>\n<p>“How horrid of you, Harry!” cried the duchess. “Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?</p>\n<p>Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint.”</p>",
        "<p>Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. “It is nothing,</p>\n<p>Duchess,” he murmured; “my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is</p>\n<p>all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn’t hear what</p>\n<p>Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think</p>\n<p>I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won’t you?”</p>\n<p>They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the</p>\n<p>conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian,</p>",
        "<p>Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.</p>\n<p>“Are you very much in love with him?” he asked.</p>\n<p>She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. “I</p>\n<p>wish I knew,” she said at last.</p>\n<p>He shook his head. “Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty</p>\n<p>that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.”</p>\n<p>“One may lose one’s way.”</p>",
        "<p>“All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.”</p>\n<p>“What is that?”</p>\n<p>“Disillusion.”</p>\n<p>“It was my _début_ in life,” she sighed.</p>\n<p>“It came to you crowned.”</p>\n<p>“I am tired of strawberry leaves.”</p>\n<p>“They become you.”</p>",
        "<p>“Only in public.”</p>\n<p>“You would miss them,” said Lord Henry.</p>\n<p>“I will not part with a petal.”</p>\n<p>“Monmouth has ears.”</p>\n<p>“Old age is dull of hearing.”</p>\n<p>“Has he never been jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I wish he had been.”</p>",
        "<p>He glanced about as if in search of something. “What are you looking</p>\n<p>for?” she inquired.</p>\n<p>“The button from your foil,” he answered. “You have dropped it.”</p>\n<p>She laughed. “I have still the mask.”</p>\n<p>“It makes your eyes lovelier,” was his reply.</p>\n<p>She laughed again. Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet</p>\n<p>fruit.</p>",
        "<p>Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror</p>\n<p>in every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly become too</p>\n<p>hideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of the unlucky</p>\n<p>beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to</p>\n<p>pre-figure death for himself also. He had nearly swooned at what Lord</p>\n<p>Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.</p>\n<p>At five o’clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to</p>",
        "<p>pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham</p>\n<p>at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another</p>\n<p>night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened place. Death walked there in</p>\n<p>the sunlight. The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.</p>\n<p>Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to</p>\n<p>town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in</p>\n<p>his absence. As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to</p>",
        "<p>the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see</p>\n<p>him. He frowned and bit his lip. “Send him in,” he muttered, after some</p>\n<p>moments’ hesitation.</p>\n<p>As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a</p>\n<p>drawer and spread it out before him.</p>\n<p>“I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this</p>\n<p>morning, Thornton?” he said, taking up a pen.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the gamekeeper.</p>\n<p>“Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?”</p>\n<p>asked Dorian, looking bored. “If so, I should not like them to be left</p>\n<p>in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of</p>\n<p>coming to you about.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t know who he is?” said Dorian, listlessly. “What do you mean?</p>",
        "<p>Wasn’t he one of your men?”</p>\n<p>“No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir.”</p>\n<p>The pen dropped from Dorian Gray’s hand, and he felt as if his heart</p>\n<p>had suddenly stopped beating. “A sailor?” he cried out. “Did you say a</p>\n<p>sailor?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on</p>\n<p>both arms, and that kind of thing.”</p>",
        "<p>“Was there anything found on him?” said Dorian, leaning forward and</p>\n<p>looking at the man with startled eyes. “Anything that would tell his</p>\n<p>name?”</p>\n<p>“Some money, sir—not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any</p>\n<p>kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we</p>\n<p>think.”</p>\n<p>Dorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He</p>",
        "<p>clutched at it madly. “Where is the body?” he exclaimed. “Quick! I must</p>\n<p>see it at once.”</p>\n<p>“It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don’t like to</p>\n<p>have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings bad</p>\n<p>luck.”</p>\n<p>“The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms to</p>\n<p>bring my horse round. No. Never mind. I’ll go to the stables myself. It</p>",
        "<p>will save time.”</p>\n<p>In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the</p>\n<p>long avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him</p>\n<p>in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his</p>\n<p>path. Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him.</p>\n<p>He lashed her across the neck with his crop. She cleft the dusky air</p>\n<p>like an arrow. The stones flew from her hoofs.</p>",
        "<p>At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard.</p>\n<p>He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the</p>\n<p>farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him</p>\n<p>that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand</p>\n<p>upon the latch.</p>\n<p>There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a</p>\n<p>discovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he thrust the</p>",
        "<p>door open and entered.</p>\n<p>On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man</p>\n<p>dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted</p>\n<p>handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in a</p>\n<p>bottle, sputtered beside it.</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to take</p>\n<p>the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to</p>",
        "<p>come to him.</p>\n<p>“Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it,” he said, clutching at</p>\n<p>the door-post for support.</p>\n<p>When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of joy</p>\n<p>broke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was James</p>\n<p>Vane.</p>\n<p>He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he rode</p>",
        "<p>home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XIX</h3>\n<p>“There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,” cried</p>\n<p>Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled</p>\n<p>with rose-water. “You are quite perfect. Pray, don’t change.”</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray shook his head. “No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful</p>\n<p>things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good</p>\n<p>actions yesterday.”</p>",
        "<p>“Where were you yesterday?”</p>\n<p>“In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.”</p>\n<p>“My dear boy,” said Lord Henry, smiling, “anybody can be good in the</p>\n<p>country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people</p>\n<p>who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not</p>\n<p>by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by</p>\n<p>which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being</p>",
        "<p>corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they</p>\n<p>stagnate.”</p>\n<p>“Culture and corruption,” echoed Dorian. “I have known something of</p>\n<p>both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found</p>\n<p>together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I</p>\n<p>have altered.”</p>\n<p>“You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you</p>",
        "<p>had done more than one?” asked his companion as he spilled into his</p>\n<p>plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a</p>\n<p>perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.</p>\n<p>“I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else.</p>\n<p>I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She</p>\n<p>was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was</p>\n<p>that which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, don’t you?</p>",
        "<p>How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of</p>\n<p>course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I</p>\n<p>am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we</p>\n<p>have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a</p>\n<p>week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept</p>\n<p>tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone</p>\n<p>away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her</p>",
        "<p>as flowerlike as I had found her.”</p>\n<p>“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill</p>\n<p>of real pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry. “But I can finish</p>\n<p>your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That</p>\n<p>was the beginning of your reformation.”</p>\n<p>“Harry, you are horrible! You mustn’t say these dreadful things.</p>\n<p>Hetty’s heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But</p>",
        "<p>there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her</p>\n<p>garden of mint and marigold.”</p>\n<p>“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing, as he</p>\n<p>leaned back in his chair. “My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously</p>\n<p>boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now</p>\n<p>with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to</p>\n<p>a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having met</p>",
        "<p>you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will</p>\n<p>be wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much</p>\n<p>of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides,</p>\n<p>how do you know that Hetty isn’t floating at the present moment in some</p>\n<p>starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?”</p>\n<p>“I can’t bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest the</p>\n<p>most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don’t care what</p>",
        "<p>you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I</p>\n<p>rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window,</p>\n<p>like a spray of jasmine. Don’t let us talk about it any more, and don’t</p>\n<p>try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years,</p>\n<p>the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a</p>\n<p>sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me</p>\n<p>something about yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to</p>",
        "<p>the club for days.”</p>\n<p>“The people are still discussing poor Basil’s disappearance.”</p>\n<p>“I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,” said</p>\n<p>Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.</p>\n<p>“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and</p>\n<p>the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having</p>\n<p>more than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate</p>",
        "<p>lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell’s</p>\n<p>suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.</p>\n<p>Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left</p>\n<p>for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor</p>\n<p>Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris</p>\n<p>at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has</p>\n<p>been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who</p>",
        "<p>disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful</p>\n<p>city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.”</p>\n<p>“What do you think has happened to Basil?” asked Dorian, holding up his</p>\n<p>Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could</p>\n<p>discuss the matter so calmly.</p>\n<p>“I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is</p>\n<p>no business of mine. If he is dead, I don’t want to think about him.</p>",
        "<p>Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” said the younger man wearily.</p>\n<p>“Because,” said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt</p>\n<p>trellis of an open vinaigrette box, “one can survive everything</p>\n<p>nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the</p>\n<p>nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee</p>\n<p>in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with</p>",
        "<p>whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was</p>\n<p>very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her. Of course,</p>\n<p>married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the</p>\n<p>loss even of one’s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most.</p>\n<p>They are such an essential part of one’s personality.”</p>\n<p>Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next</p>\n<p>room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white</p>",
        "<p>and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he</p>\n<p>stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, “Harry, did it ever</p>\n<p>occur to you that Basil was murdered?”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry yawned. “Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury</p>\n<p>watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to</p>\n<p>have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a</p>\n<p>man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was</p>",
        "<p>really rather dull. He only interested me once, and that was when he</p>\n<p>told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you</p>\n<p>were the dominant motive of his art.”</p>\n<p>“I was very fond of Basil,” said Dorian with a note of sadness in his</p>\n<p>voice. “But don’t people say that he was murdered?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all</p>\n<p>probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not</p>",
        "<p>the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his</p>\n<p>chief defect.”</p>\n<p>“What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?”</p>\n<p>said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had spoken.</p>\n<p>“I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that</p>\n<p>doesn’t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.</p>\n<p>It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your</p>",
        "<p>vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs</p>\n<p>exclusively to the lower orders. I don’t blame them in the smallest</p>\n<p>degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply</p>\n<p>a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.”</p>\n<p>“A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who</p>\n<p>has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?</p>\n<p>Don’t tell me that.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,” cried Lord</p>\n<p>Henry, laughing. “That is one of the most important secrets of life. I</p>\n<p>should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should</p>\n<p>never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us</p>\n<p>pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a</p>\n<p>really romantic end as you suggest, but I can’t. I dare say he fell</p>\n<p>into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the</p>",
        "<p>scandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on</p>\n<p>his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating</p>\n<p>over him and long weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I don’t</p>\n<p>think he would have done much more good work. During the last ten years</p>\n<p>his painting had gone off very much.”</p>\n<p>Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began</p>\n<p>to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged</p>",
        "<p>bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo</p>\n<p>perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of</p>\n<p>crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards</p>\n<p>and forwards.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of</p>\n<p>his pocket; “his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have</p>\n<p>lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased to be</p>",
        "<p>great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated</p>\n<p>you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you. It’s a habit</p>\n<p>bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he</p>\n<p>did of you? I don’t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh!</p>\n<p>I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to</p>\n<p>Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way. You never got</p>\n<p>it back? What a pity! it was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted</p>",
        "<p>to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to Basil’s best period. Since</p>\n<p>then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good</p>\n<p>intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative</p>\n<p>British artist. Did you advertise for it? You should.”</p>\n<p>“I forget,” said Dorian. “I suppose I did. But I never really liked it.</p>\n<p>I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me. Why</p>\n<p>do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some</p>",
        "<p>play—Hamlet, I think—how do they run?—</p>\n<p>“Like the painting of a sorrow,</p>\n<p>A face without a heart.”</p>\n<p>Yes: that is what it was like.”</p>\n<p>Lord Henry laughed. “If a man treats life artistically, his brain is</p>\n<p>his heart,” he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.</p>\n<p>Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.</p>",
        "<p>“‘Like the painting of a sorrow,’” he repeated, “‘a face without a</p>\n<p>heart.’”</p>\n<p>The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes. “By the</p>\n<p>way, Dorian,” he said after a pause, “‘what does it profit a man if he</p>\n<p>gain the whole world and lose—how does the quotation run?—his own</p>\n<p>soul’?”</p>\n<p>The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.</p>",
        "<p>“Why do you ask me that, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“My dear fellow,” said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,</p>\n<p>“I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.</p>\n<p>That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the</p>\n<p>Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people</p>\n<p>listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the</p>\n<p>man yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being</p>",
        "<p>rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A</p>\n<p>wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly</p>\n<p>white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful</p>\n<p>phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips—it was really very</p>\n<p>good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet</p>\n<p>that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he</p>\n<p>would not have understood me.”</p>",
        "<p>“Don’t, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and</p>\n<p>sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is</p>\n<p>a soul in each one of us. I know it.”</p>\n<p>“Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?”</p>\n<p>“Quite sure.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely</p>\n<p>certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the</p>",
        "<p>lesson of romance. How grave you are! Don’t be so serious. What have</p>\n<p>you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up</p>\n<p>our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian,</p>\n<p>and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your</p>\n<p>youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you</p>\n<p>are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful,</p>\n<p>Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You</p>",
        "<p>remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy,</p>\n<p>and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in</p>\n<p>appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth</p>\n<p>I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early,</p>\n<p>or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It’s absurd to talk</p>\n<p>of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen</p>\n<p>now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in</p>",
        "<p>front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the</p>\n<p>aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask</p>\n<p>them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly</p>\n<p>give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks,</p>\n<p>believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that</p>\n<p>thing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca,</p>\n<p>with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against</p>",
        "<p>the panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that</p>\n<p>there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don’t stop. I want</p>\n<p>music to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I</p>\n<p>am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that</p>\n<p>even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is</p>\n<p>old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.</p>\n<p>Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You</p>",
        "<p>have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against</p>\n<p>your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. And it has all been to</p>\n<p>you no more than the sound of music. It has not marred you. You are</p>\n<p>still the same.”</p>\n<p>“I am not the same, Harry.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.</p>\n<p>Don’t spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.</p>",
        "<p>Don’t make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need</p>\n<p>not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don’t deceive</p>\n<p>yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question</p>\n<p>of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides</p>\n<p>itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe and</p>\n<p>think yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour in a room or a</p>\n<p>morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that</p>",
        "<p>brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you</p>\n<p>had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had</p>\n<p>ceased to play—I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that</p>\n<p>our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own</p>\n<p>senses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of</p>\n<p>_lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the</p>\n<p>strangest month of my life over again. I wish I could change places</p>",
        "<p>with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has</p>\n<p>always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of</p>\n<p>what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am</p>\n<p>so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or</p>\n<p>painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has</p>\n<p>been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your</p>\n<p>sonnets.”</p>",
        "<p>Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>“Yes, life has been exquisite,” he murmured, “but I am not going to</p>\n<p>have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant</p>\n<p>things to me. You don’t know everything about me. I think that if you</p>\n<p>did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don’t laugh.”</p>\n<p>“Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne</p>\n<p>over again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the</p>",
        "<p>dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she</p>\n<p>will come closer to the earth. You won’t? Let us go to the club, then.</p>\n<p>It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is</p>\n<p>some one at White’s who wants immensely to know you—young Lord Poole,</p>\n<p>Bournemouth’s eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has</p>\n<p>begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather</p>\n<p>reminds me of you.”</p>",
        "<p>“I hope not,” said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. “But I am tired</p>\n<p>to-night, Harry. I shan’t go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I</p>\n<p>want to go to bed early.”</p>\n<p>“Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was</p>\n<p>something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than</p>\n<p>I had ever heard from it before.”</p>\n<p>“It is because I am going to be good,” he answered, smiling. “I am a</p>",
        "<p>little changed already.”</p>\n<p>“You cannot change to me, Dorian,” said Lord Henry. “You and I will</p>\n<p>always be friends.”</p>\n<p>“Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.</p>\n<p>Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It</p>\n<p>does harm.”</p>\n<p>“My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be</p>",
        "<p>going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people</p>\n<p>against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too</p>\n<p>delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we</p>\n<p>are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,</p>\n<p>there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It</p>\n<p>annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that</p>\n<p>the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.</p>",
        "<p>That is all. But we won’t discuss literature. Come round to-morrow. I</p>\n<p>am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you</p>\n<p>to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and</p>\n<p>wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.</p>\n<p>Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she</p>\n<p>never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you</p>\n<p>would be. Her clever tongue gets on one’s nerves. Well, in any case, be</p>",
        "<p>here at eleven.”</p>\n<p>“Must I really come, Harry?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don’t think there have been</p>\n<p>such lilacs since the year I met you.”</p>\n<p>“Very well. I shall be here at eleven,” said Dorian. “Good night,</p>\n<p>Harry.” As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had</p>\n<p>something more to say. Then he sighed and went out.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XX</h3>\n<p>It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and</p>\n<p>did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home,</p>\n<p>smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He</p>\n<p>heard one of them whisper to the other, “That is Dorian Gray.” He</p>\n<p>remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared</p>\n<p>at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the</p>",
        "<p>charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that</p>\n<p>no one knew who he was. He had often told the girl whom he had lured to</p>\n<p>love him that he was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her</p>\n<p>once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that</p>\n<p>wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she</p>\n<p>had!—just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her</p>\n<p>cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had</p>",
        "<p>everything that he had lost.</p>\n<p>When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent</p>\n<p>him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and</p>\n<p>began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.</p>\n<p>Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing</p>\n<p>for the unstained purity of his boyhood—his rose-white boyhood, as Lord</p>\n<p>Henry had once called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled</p>",
        "<p>his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had</p>\n<p>been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in</p>\n<p>being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been</p>\n<p>the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.</p>\n<p>But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?</p>\n<p>Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that</p>\n<p>the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the</p>",
        "<p>unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to</p>\n<p>that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure</p>\n<p>swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not</p>\n<p>“Forgive us our sins” but “Smite us for our iniquities” should be the</p>\n<p>prayer of man to a most just God.</p>\n<p>The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many</p>\n<p>years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids</p>",
        "<p>laughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on that night</p>\n<p>of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and</p>\n<p>with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield. Once, some</p>\n<p>one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending</p>\n<p>with these idolatrous words: “The world is changed because you are made</p>\n<p>of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.” The</p>\n<p>phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to</p>",
        "<p>himself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the</p>\n<p>floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his</p>\n<p>beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed</p>\n<p>for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from</p>\n<p>stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.</p>\n<p>What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow</p>\n<p>moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had</p>",
        "<p>spoiled him.</p>\n<p>It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It</p>\n<p>was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane</p>\n<p>was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had</p>\n<p>shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the</p>\n<p>secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was,</p>\n<p>over Basil Hallward’s disappearance would soon pass away. It was</p>",
        "<p>already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the</p>\n<p>death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the</p>\n<p>living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the</p>\n<p>portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It</p>\n<p>was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him</p>\n<p>that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The</p>\n<p>murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell,</p>",
        "<p>his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it. It was</p>\n<p>nothing to him.</p>\n<p>A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for.</p>\n<p>Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at</p>\n<p>any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.</p>\n<p>As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in</p>\n<p>the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it</p>",
        "<p>had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel</p>\n<p>every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had</p>\n<p>already gone away. He would go and look.</p>\n<p>He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the</p>\n<p>door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face</p>\n<p>and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and</p>\n<p>the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror</p>",
        "<p>to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.</p>\n<p>He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and</p>\n<p>dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and</p>\n<p>indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the</p>\n<p>eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of</p>\n<p>the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome—more loathsome, if</p>\n<p>possible, than before—and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed</p>",
        "<p>brighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it</p>\n<p>been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the</p>\n<p>desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking</p>\n<p>laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things</p>\n<p>finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the</p>\n<p>red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a</p>\n<p>horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the</p>",
        "<p>painted feet, as though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand</p>\n<p>that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to</p>\n<p>confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt</p>\n<p>that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would</p>\n<p>believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.</p>\n<p>Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned</p>\n<p>what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.</p>",
        "<p>They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his</p>\n<p>duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.</p>\n<p>There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well</p>\n<p>as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had</p>\n<p>told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of</p>\n<p>Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty</p>\n<p>Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he</p>",
        "<p>was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing</p>\n<p>more in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At</p>\n<p>least he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing</p>\n<p>more. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the</p>\n<p>mask of goodness. For curiosity’s sake he had tried the denial of self.</p>\n<p>He recognized that now.</p>\n<p>But this murder—was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be</p>",
        "<p>burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only</p>\n<p>one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself—that was</p>\n<p>evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had</p>\n<p>given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had</p>\n<p>felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been</p>\n<p>away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon</p>\n<p>it. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had</p>",
        "<p>marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it</p>\n<p>had been conscience. He would destroy it.</p>\n<p>He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He</p>\n<p>had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was</p>\n<p>bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill</p>\n<p>the painter’s work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past,</p>\n<p>and when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous</p>",
        "<p>soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He</p>\n<p>seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.</p>\n<p>There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its</p>\n<p>agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.</p>\n<p>Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked</p>\n<p>up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and</p>\n<p>brought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no</p>",
        "<p>answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all</p>\n<p>dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and</p>\n<p>watched.</p>\n<p>“Whose house is that, Constable?” asked the elder of the two gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman.</p>\n<p>They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of</p>\n<p>them was Sir Henry Ashton’s uncle.</p>",
        "<p>Inside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half-clad domestics</p>\n<p>were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying</p>\n<p>and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.</p>\n<p>After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the</p>\n<p>footmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They</p>\n<p>called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force</p>\n<p>the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The</p>",
        "<p>windows yielded easily—their bolts were old.</p>\n<p>When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait</p>\n<p>of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his</p>\n<p>exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in</p>\n<p>evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled,</p>\n<p>and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings</p>\n<p>that they recognized who it was.</p>",
