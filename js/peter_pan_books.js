        "<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>\n<p>Alice’s Evidence</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>\n<p>Down the Rabbit-Hole</p>\n<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the</p>\n<p>bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into</p>\n<p>the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or</p>\n",
        "<p>conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice</p>\n<p>“without pictures or conversations?”</p>\n<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the</p>\n<p>hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of</p>\n<p>making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and</p>\n<p>picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran</p>\n<p>close by her.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it</p>\n<p>so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh</p>\n<p>dear!</p>\n<p>Oh dear!</p>\n<p>I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,</p>\n<p>it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the</p>\n<p>time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a</p>\n",
        "<p>watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried</p>\n<p>on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she</p>\n<p>had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a</p>\n<p>watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p>\n<p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a</p>\n<p>large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>\n<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how</p>\n",
        "<p>in the world she was to get out again.</p>\n<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then</p>\n<p>dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think</p>\n<p>about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very</p>\n<p>deep well.</p>\n<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had</p>\n<p>plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what</p>\n",
        "<p>was going to happen next.</p>\n<p>First, she tried to look down and make out</p>\n<p>what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she</p>\n<p>looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with</p>\n<p>cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures</p>\n<p>hung upon pegs.</p>\n<p>She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she</p>\n",
        "<p>passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great</p>\n<p>disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear</p>\n<p>of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the</p>\n<p>cupboards as she fell past it.</p>\n<p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall</p>\n<p>think nothing of tumbling down stairs!</p>\n<p>How brave they’ll all think me</p>\n",
        "<p>at home!</p>\n<p>Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the</p>\n<p>top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p>\n<p>Down, down, down.</p>\n<p>Would the fall _never_ come to an end?</p>\n<p>“I wonder how</p>\n<p>many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I must be</p>\n<p>getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.</p>\n<p>Let me see: that would</p>\n<p>be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt</p>\n<p>several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and</p>\n<p>though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her</p>\n<p>knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good</p>\n",
        "<p>practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but</p>\n<p>then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no</p>\n<p>idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice</p>\n<p>grand words to say.)</p>\n<p>Presently she began again.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if I shall fall right _through_</p>\n<p>the earth!</p>\n",
        "<p>How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk</p>\n<p>with their heads downward!</p>\n<p>The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather</p>\n<p>glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all</p>\n<p>the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the</p>\n<p>country is, you know.</p>\n<p>Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”</p>\n",
        "<p>(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re</p>\n<p>falling through the air!</p>\n<p>Do you think you could manage it?) “And what</p>\n<p>an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking!</p>\n<p>No, it’ll never do</p>\n<p>to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”</p>\n<p>Down, down, down.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began</p>\n<p>talking again.</p>\n<p>“Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”</p>\n<p>(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at</p>\n<p>tea-time.</p>\n<p>Dinah my dear!</p>\n<p>I wish you were down here with me!</p>\n",
        "<p>There are</p>\n<p>no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s</p>\n<p>very like a mouse, you know.</p>\n<p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here</p>\n<p>Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a</p>\n<p>dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats?</p>\n<p>Do cats eat bats?” and</p>\n",
        "<p>sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer</p>\n<p>either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it.</p>\n<p>She felt</p>\n<p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was</p>\n<p>walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,</p>\n<p>“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,</p>\n<p>thump!</p>\n",
        "<p>thump!</p>\n<p>down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and</p>\n<p>the fall was over.</p>\n<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:</p>\n<p>she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another</p>\n<p>long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,</p>\n<p>and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears</p>\n<p>and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she</p>\n<p>turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p>\n<p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging</p>\n<p>from the roof.</p>\n<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when</p>\n",
        "<p>Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every</p>\n<p>door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to</p>\n<p>get out again.</p>\n<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid</p>\n<p>glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s</p>\n<p>first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;</p>\n<p>but, alas!</p>\n",
        "<p>either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,</p>\n<p>but at any rate it would not open any of them.</p>\n<p>However, on the second</p>\n<p>time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and</p>\n<p>behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the</p>\n<p>little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>\n<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not</p>\n",
        "<p>much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the</p>\n<p>passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p>\n<p>How she longed to get</p>\n<p>out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright</p>\n<p>flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head</p>\n<p>through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought</p>\n<p>poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders.</p>\n",
        "<p>Oh,</p>\n<p>how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!</p>\n<p>I think I could, if I only</p>\n<p>knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had</p>\n<p>happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things</p>\n<p>indeed were really impossible.</p>\n<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went</p>\n",
        "<p>back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at</p>\n<p>any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this</p>\n<p>time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here</p>\n<p>before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper</p>\n<p>label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large</p>\n<p>letters.</p>\n<p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was</p>\n",
        "<p>not going to do _that_ in a hurry.</p>\n<p>“No, I’ll look first,” she said,</p>\n<p>“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read</p>\n<p>several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and</p>\n<p>eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they</p>\n<p>_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:</p>\n<p>such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;</p>\n",
        "<p>and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually</p>\n<p>bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a</p>\n<p>bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,</p>\n<p>sooner or later.</p>\n<p>However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to</p>\n<p>taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed</p>\n<p>flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and</p>\n",
        "<p>hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n<p>“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a</p>\n<p>telescope.”</p>\n<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face</p>\n",
        "<p>brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going</p>\n<p>through the little door into that lovely garden.</p>\n<p>First, however, she</p>\n<p>waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:</p>\n<p>she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”</p>\n<p>said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n",
        "<p>wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the</p>\n<p>flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could</p>\n<p>not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>\n<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going</p>\n<p>into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p>\n<p>when she got to the</p>\n<p>door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she</p>\n",
        "<p>went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach</p>\n<p>it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her</p>\n<p>best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p>\n<p>and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing</p>\n<p>sat down and cried.</p>\n<p>“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,</p>\n<p>rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally</p>\n",
        "<p>gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),</p>\n<p>and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into</p>\n<p>her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having</p>\n<p>cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,</p>\n<p>for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.</p>\n<p>“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two</p>\n<p>people!</p>\n",
        "<p>Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable</p>\n<p>person!”</p>\n<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:</p>\n<p>she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words</p>\n<p>“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ll eat it,” said</p>\n<p>Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it</p>\n",
        "<p>makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll</p>\n<p>get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p>\n<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way?</p>\n<p>Which</p>\n<p>way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was</p>\n<p>growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same</p>\n<p>size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice</p>\n",
        "<p>had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way</p>\n<p>things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go</p>\n<p>on in the common way.</p>\n<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n",
        "<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>\n<p>The Pool of Tears</p>\n<p>“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that</p>\n<p>for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m</p>\n<p>opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!</p>\n<p>Good-bye, feet!”</p>\n<p>(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of</p>\n",
        "<p>sight, they were getting so far off).</p>\n<p>“Oh, my poor little feet, I</p>\n<p>wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?</p>\n<p>I’m</p>\n<p>sure _I_ shan’t be able!</p>\n<p>I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble</p>\n<p>myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be</p>\n",
        "<p>kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I</p>\n<p>want to go!</p>\n<p>Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every</p>\n<p>Christmas.”</p>\n<p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p>\n<p>“They must</p>\n<p>go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending</p>\n",
        "<p>presents to one’s own feet!</p>\n<p>And how odd the directions will look!</p>\n<p>_Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with</p>\n<p>Alice’s love_).</p>\n<p>Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”</p>\n<p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was</p>\n<p>now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden</p>\n",
        "<p>key and hurried off to the garden door.</p>\n<p>Poor Alice!</p>\n<p>It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to</p>\n<p>look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more</p>\n<p>hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p>\n<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like</p>\n<p>you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way!</p>\n",
        "<p>Stop</p>\n<p>this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding</p>\n<p>gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about</p>\n<p>four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.</p>\n<p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and</p>\n<p>she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p>\n<p>It was the White</p>\n",
        "<p>Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves</p>\n<p>in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a</p>\n<p>great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh!</p>\n<p>the Duchess, the</p>\n<p>Duchess!</p>\n<p>Oh!</p>\n<p>won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt</p>\n",
        "<p>so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the</p>\n<p>Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,</p>\n<p>sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and</p>\n<p>the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p>\n<p>Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she</p>\n<p>kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear!</p>\n<p>How</p>\n",
        "<p>queer everything is to-day!</p>\n<p>And yesterday things went on just as usual.</p>\n<p>I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night?</p>\n<p>Let me think: was I the</p>\n<p>same when I got up this morning?</p>\n<p>I almost think I can remember feeling</p>\n<p>a little different.</p>\n",
        "<p>But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who</p>\n<p>in the world am I?</p>\n<p>Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began</p>\n<p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as</p>\n<p>herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long</p>\n<p>ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t</p>\n",
        "<p>be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!</p>\n<p>she knows such a</p>\n<p>very little!</p>\n<p>Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how</p>\n<p>puzzling it all is!</p>\n<p>I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.</p>\n<p>Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,</p>\n",
        "<p>and four times seven is—oh dear!</p>\n<p>I shall never get to twenty at that</p>\n<p>rate!</p>\n<p>However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try</p>\n<p>Geography.</p>\n<p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of</p>\n<p>Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain!</p>\n",
        "<p>I must have been</p>\n<p>changed for Mabel!</p>\n<p>I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she</p>\n<p>crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began</p>\n<p>to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words</p>\n<p>did not come the same as they used to do:—</p>\n<p>“How doth the little crocodile</p>\n",
        "<p>Improve his shining tail,</p>\n<p>And pour the waters of the Nile</p>\n<p>On every golden scale!</p>\n<p>“How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p>\n<p>How neatly spread his claws,</p>\n<p>And welcome little fishes in</p>\n<p>With gently smiling jaws!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes</p>\n<p>filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and</p>\n<p>I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to</p>\n<p>no toys to play with, and oh!</p>\n<p>ever so many lessons to learn!</p>\n<p>No, I’ve</p>\n<p>made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here!</p>\n",
        "<p>It’ll be</p>\n<p>no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’</p>\n<p>I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then?</p>\n<p>Tell me that first, and</p>\n<p>then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down</p>\n<p>here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden</p>\n<p>burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down!</p>\n",
        "<p>I am so</p>\n<p>_very_ tired of being all alone here!”</p>\n<p>As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see</p>\n<p>that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while</p>\n<p>she was talking.</p>\n<p>“How _can_ I have done that?” she thought.</p>\n<p>“I must be</p>\n",
        "<p>growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure</p>\n<p>herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was</p>\n<p>now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon</p>\n<p>found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she</p>\n<p>dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p>\n<p>“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the</p>\n<p>sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and</p>\n",
        "<p>now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little</p>\n<p>door: but, alas!</p>\n<p>the little door was shut again, and the little golden</p>\n<p>key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than</p>\n<p>ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this</p>\n<p>before, never!</p>\n<p>And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”</p>\n",
        "<p>As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,</p>\n<p>splash!</p>\n<p>she was up to her chin in salt water.</p>\n<p>Her first idea was that</p>\n<p>she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by</p>\n<p>railway,” she said to herself.</p>\n<p>(Alice had been to the seaside once in</p>\n",
        "<p>her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go</p>\n<p>to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the</p>\n<p>sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row</p>\n<p>of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she</p>\n<p>soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when</p>\n<p>she was nine feet high.</p>\n<p>“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying</p>\n",
        "<p>to find her way out.</p>\n<p>“I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by</p>\n<p>being drowned in my own tears!</p>\n<p>That _will_ be a queer thing, to be</p>\n<p>sure!</p>\n<p>However, everything is queer to-day.”</p>\n<p>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way</p>\n",
        "<p>off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought</p>\n<p>it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small</p>\n<p>she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had</p>\n<p>slipped in like herself.</p>\n<p>“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?</p>\n<p>Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very</p>\n<p>likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she</p>\n",
        "<p>began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?</p>\n<p>I am very tired</p>\n<p>of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right</p>\n<p>way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but</p>\n<p>she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of</p>\n<p>a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather</p>\n<p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,</p>\n",
        "<p>but it said nothing.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s</p>\n<p>a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all</p>\n<p>her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago</p>\n<p>anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which</p>\n<p>was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.</p>\n<p>The Mouse gave a</p>\n",
        "<p>sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with</p>\n<p>fright.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she</p>\n<p>had hurt the poor animal’s feelings.</p>\n<p>“I quite forgot you didn’t like</p>\n<p>cats.”</p>\n<p>“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Would</p>\n<p>_you_ like cats if you were me?”</p>\n<p>“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry</p>\n<p>about it.</p>\n<p>And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d</p>\n<p>take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p>\n<p>She is such a dear</p>\n",
        "<p>quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about</p>\n<p>in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her</p>\n<p>paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to</p>\n<p>nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your</p>\n<p>pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all</p>\n<p>over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.</p>\n<p>“We won’t talk</p>\n",
        "<p>about her any more if you’d rather not.”</p>\n<p>“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his</p>\n<p>tail.</p>\n<p>“As if _I_ would talk on such a subject!</p>\n<p>Our family always</p>\n<p>_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!</p>\n<p>Don’t let me hear the name</p>\n",
        "<p>again!”</p>\n<p>“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of</p>\n<p>conversation.</p>\n<p>“Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not</p>\n<p>answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near</p>\n<p>our house I should like to show you!</p>\n<p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you</p>\n",
        "<p>know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!</p>\n<p>And it’ll fetch things when</p>\n<p>you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts</p>\n<p>of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you</p>\n<p>know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds!</p>\n<p>He says</p>\n<p>it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,</p>\n",
        "<p>“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away</p>\n<p>from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the</p>\n<p>pool as it went.</p>\n<p>So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear!</p>\n<p>Do come back again, and we</p>\n<p>won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the</p>\n<p>Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face</p>\n",
        "<p>was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low</p>\n<p>trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my</p>\n<p>history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”</p>\n<p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the</p>\n<p>birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a</p>\n<p>Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.</p>\n<p>Alice</p>\n",
        "<p>led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>\n<p>A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p>\n<p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the</p>\n<p>birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close</p>\n<p>to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a</p>\n",
        "<p>consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite</p>\n<p>natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if</p>\n<p>she had known them all her life.</p>\n<p>Indeed, she had quite a long argument</p>\n<p>with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am</p>\n<p>older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow</p>\n<p>without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to</p>\n",
        "<p>tell its age, there was no more to be said.</p>\n<p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,</p>\n<p>called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!</p>\n<p>_I’ll_ soon make</p>\n<p>you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the</p>\n<p>Mouse in the middle.</p>\n<p>Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she</p>\n",
        "<p>felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p>\n<p>“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready?</p>\n<p>This</p>\n<p>is the driest thing I know.</p>\n<p>Silence all round, if you please!</p>\n<p>‘William</p>\n<p>the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted</p>\n",

        "<p>“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.</p>\n<p>“I thought you did,” said the Mouse.</p>\n<p>“—I proceed.</p>\n<p>‘Edwin and Morcar,</p>\n<p>the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even</p>\n<p>Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”</p>\n<p>“Found _what_?” said the Duck.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know</p>\n<p>what ‘it’ means.”</p>\n<p>“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the</p>\n<p>Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm.</p>\n<p>The question is, what did the</p>\n<p>archbishop find?”</p>\n<p>The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found</p>\n",
        "<p>it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him</p>\n<p>the crown.</p>\n<p>William’s conduct at first was moderate.</p>\n<p>But the insolence</p>\n<p>of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,</p>\n<p>turning to Alice as it spoke.</p>\n<p>“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to</p>\n",
        "<p>dry me at all.”</p>\n<p>“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move</p>\n<p>that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic</p>\n<p>remedies—”</p>\n<p>“Speak English!” said the Eaglet.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know the meaning of half</p>\n<p>those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And</p>\n",
        "<p>the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds</p>\n<p>tittered audibly.</p>\n<p>“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,</p>\n<p>that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”</p>\n<p>“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to</p>\n<p>know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to</p>\n<p>speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,</p>\n<p>as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will</p>\n<p>tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p>\n<p>First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact</p>\n<p>shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed</p>\n<p>along the course, here and there.</p>\n<p>There was no “One, two, three, and</p>\n",
        "<p>away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they</p>\n<p>liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.</p>\n<p>However,</p>\n<p>when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry</p>\n<p>again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all</p>\n<p>crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”</p>\n<p>This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p>\n",
        "<p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its</p>\n<p>forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the</p>\n<p>pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.</p>\n<p>At last the Dodo</p>\n<p>said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”</p>\n<p>“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.</p>\n<p>“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one</p>\n",
        "<p>finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a</p>\n<p>confused way, “Prizes!</p>\n<p>Prizes!”</p>\n<p>Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her</p>\n<p>pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had</p>\n<p>not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p>\n<p>There was exactly</p>\n",
        "<p>one a-piece, all round.</p>\n<p>“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.</p>\n<p>“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely.</p>\n<p>“What else have you got in</p>\n<p>your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.</p>\n<p>“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.</p>\n<p>“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly</p>\n<p>presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant</p>\n<p>thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all</p>\n<p>cheered.</p>\n<p>Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave</p>\n<p>that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything</p>\n<p>to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as</p>\n",
        "<p>she could.</p>\n<p>The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and</p>\n<p>confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste</p>\n<p>theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.</p>\n<p>However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and</p>\n<p>begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p>\n<p>“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why</p>\n",
        "<p>it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it</p>\n<p>would be offended again.</p>\n<p>“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and</p>\n<p>sighing.</p>\n<p>“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder</p>\n<p>at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on</p>\n<p>puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the</p>\n",
        "<p>tale was something like this:—</p>\n<p>“Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both</p>\n<p>go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no</p>\n<p>denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve</p>\n<p>nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear</p>\n<p>sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’</p>\n<p>‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll</p>\n",
        "<p>try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”</p>\n<p>“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p>\n<p>“What are</p>\n<p>you thinking of?”</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth</p>\n<p>bend, I think?”</p>\n<p>“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p>\n",
        "<p>“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking</p>\n<p>anxiously about her.</p>\n<p>“Oh, do let me help to undo it!”</p>\n<p>“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and</p>\n<p>walking away.</p>\n<p>“You insult me by talking such nonsense!”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“But you’re so easily offended,</p>\n<p>you know!”</p>\n<p>The Mouse only growled in reply.</p>\n<p>“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and</p>\n<p>the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only</p>\n<p>shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.</p>\n<p>“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was</p>\n",
        "<p>quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to</p>\n<p>her daughter “Ah, my dear!</p>\n<p>Let this be a lesson to you never to lose</p>\n<p>_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little</p>\n<p>snappishly.</p>\n<p>“You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”</p>\n<p>“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,</p>\n",
        "<p>addressing nobody in particular.</p>\n<p>“She’d soon fetch it back!”</p>\n<p>“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the</p>\n<p>Lory.</p>\n<p>Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:</p>\n<p>“Dinah’s our cat.</p>\n<p>And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you</p>\n",
        "<p>can’t think!</p>\n<p>And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!</p>\n<p>Why,</p>\n<p>she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”</p>\n<p>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p>\n<p>Some of the</p>\n<p>birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very</p>\n",
        "<p>carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air</p>\n<p>doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice</p>\n<p>to its children, “Come away, my dears!</p>\n<p>It’s high time you were all in</p>\n<p>bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left</p>\n<p>alone.</p>\n<p>“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy</p>\n",
        "<p>tone.</p>\n<p>“Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best</p>\n<p>cat in the world!</p>\n<p>Oh, my dear Dinah!</p>\n<p>I wonder if I shall ever see you</p>\n<p>any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very</p>\n<p>lonely and low-spirited.</p>\n",
        "<p>In a little while, however, she again heard a</p>\n<p>little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up</p>\n<p>eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was</p>\n<p>coming back to finish his story.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>\n<p>The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p>\n<p>It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking</p>\n",
        "<p>anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard</p>\n<p>it muttering to itself “The Duchess!</p>\n<p>The Duchess!</p>\n<p>Oh my dear paws!</p>\n<p>Oh</p>\n<p>my fur and whiskers!</p>\n<p>She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are</p>\n",
        "<p>ferrets!</p>\n<p>Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a</p>\n<p>moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid</p>\n<p>gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but</p>\n<p>they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since</p>\n<p>her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the</p>\n<p>little door, had vanished completely.</p>\n",
        "<p>Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and</p>\n<p>called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you</p>\n<p>doing out here?</p>\n<p>Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and</p>\n<p>a fan!</p>\n<p>Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off</p>\n<p>at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the</p>\n",
        "<p>mistake it had made.</p>\n<p>“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran.</p>\n<p>“How</p>\n<p>surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am!</p>\n<p>But I’d better take him</p>\n<p>his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she</p>\n<p>came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass</p>\n",
        "<p>plate with the name “W.</p>\n<p>RABBIT,” engraved upon it.</p>\n<p>She went in without</p>\n<p>knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the</p>\n<p>real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the</p>\n<p>fan and gloves.</p>\n<p>“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for</p>\n",
        "<p>a rabbit!</p>\n<p>I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she</p>\n<p>began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice!</p>\n<p>Come</p>\n<p>here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,</p>\n<p>nurse!</p>\n<p>But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I</p>\n",
        "<p>don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house</p>\n<p>if it began ordering people about like that!”</p>\n<p>By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table</p>\n<p>in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three</p>\n<p>pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the</p>\n<p>gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a</p>\n<p>little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was no label</p>\n<p>this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it</p>\n<p>and put it to her lips.</p>\n<p>“I know _something_ interesting is sure to</p>\n<p>happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so</p>\n<p>I’ll just see what this bottle does.</p>\n<p>I do hope it’ll make me grow large</p>\n",
        "<p>again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”</p>\n<p>It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had</p>\n<p>drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,</p>\n<p>and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.</p>\n<p>She hastily put</p>\n<p>down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t</p>\n<p>grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t</p>\n",
        "<p>drunk quite so much!”</p>\n<p>Alas!</p>\n<p>it was too late to wish that!</p>\n<p>She went on growing, and growing,</p>\n<p>and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there</p>\n<p>was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with</p>\n<p>one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.</p>\n",
        "<p>Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out</p>\n<p>of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I</p>\n<p>can do no more, whatever happens.</p>\n<p>What _will_ become of me?”</p>\n<p>Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,</p>\n<p>and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there</p>\n<p>seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room</p>\n",
        "<p>again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p>\n<p>“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t</p>\n<p>always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and</p>\n<p>rabbits.</p>\n<p>I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and</p>\n<p>yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life!</p>\n<p>I do wonder what</p>\n",
        "<p>_can_ have happened to me!</p>\n<p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied</p>\n<p>that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of</p>\n<p>one!</p>\n<p>There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a</p>\n",
        "<p>sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”</p>\n<p>“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am</p>\n<p>now?</p>\n<p>That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but</p>\n<p>then—always to have lessons to learn!</p>\n<p>Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself.</p>\n",
        "<p>“How can you learn</p>\n<p>lessons in here?</p>\n<p>Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all</p>\n<p>for any lesson-books!”</p>\n<p>And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and</p>\n<p>making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes</p>\n<p>she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Mary Ann!</p>\n<p>Mary Ann!” said the voice.</p>\n<p>“Fetch me my gloves this moment!”</p>\n<p>Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.</p>\n<p>Alice knew it was</p>\n<p>the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the</p>\n<p>house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as</p>\n",
        "<p>large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.</p>\n<p>Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as</p>\n<p>the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,</p>\n<p>that attempt proved a failure.</p>\n<p>Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll</p>\n<p>go round and get in at the window.”</p>\n<p>“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied</p>\n",
        "<p>she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her</p>\n<p>hand, and made a snatch in the air.</p>\n<p>She did not get hold of anything,</p>\n<p>but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,</p>\n<p>from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a</p>\n<p>cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.</p>\n<p>Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat!</p>\n",
        "<p>Pat!</p>\n<p>Where are you?” And</p>\n<p>then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here!</p>\n<p>Digging</p>\n<p>for apples, yer honour!”</p>\n<p>“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily.</p>\n<p>“Here!</p>\n",
        "<p>Come and</p>\n<p>help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p>\n<p>“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”</p>\n<p>“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)</p>\n<p>“An arm, you goose!</p>\n<p>Who ever saw one that size?</p>\n<p>Why, it fills the whole</p>\n",
        "<p>window!”</p>\n<p>“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”</p>\n<p>There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers</p>\n<p>now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at</p>\n<p>all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her</p>\n<p>hand again, and made another snatch in the air.</p>\n",
        "<p>This time there were</p>\n<p>_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.</p>\n<p>“What a number</p>\n<p>of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice.</p>\n<p>“I wonder what</p>\n<p>they’ll do next!</p>\n<p>As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they</p>\n",
        "<p>_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”</p>\n<p>She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a</p>\n<p>rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all</p>\n<p>talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other</p>\n<p>ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!</p>\n<p>fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em</p>\n<p>together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh!</p>\n",
        "<p>they’ll do</p>\n<p>well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill!</p>\n<p>catch hold of this</p>\n<p>rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!</p>\n<p>Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I</p>\n<p>fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t!</p>\n<p>_You_ do</p>\n",
        "<p>it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill!</p>\n<p>the master says</p>\n<p>you’re to go down the chimney!”</p>\n<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n<p>“Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p>\n",
        "<p>I wouldn’t be in</p>\n<p>Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but</p>\n<p>I _think_ I can kick a little!”</p>\n<p>She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till</p>\n<p>she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)</p>\n<p>scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,</p>\n<p>saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited</p>\n",
        "<p>to see what would happen next.</p>\n<p>The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”</p>\n<p>then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then</p>\n<p>silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy</p>\n<p>now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow?</p>\n<p>What happened to you?</p>\n<p>Tell</p>\n",
        "<p>us all about it!”</p>\n<p>Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought</p>\n<p>Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m</p>\n<p>a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me</p>\n<p>like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”</p>\n<p>“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.</p>\n<p>“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice</p>\n",
        "<p>called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”</p>\n<p>There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I</p>\n<p>wonder what they _will_ do next!</p>\n<p>If they had any sense, they’d take the</p>\n<p>roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and</p>\n<p>Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”</p>\n<p>“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,</p>\n",
        "<p>for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the</p>\n<p>window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p>\n<p>“I’ll put a stop to</p>\n<p>this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that</p>\n<p>again!” which produced another dead silence.</p>\n<p>Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into</p>\n<p>little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her</p>\n",
        "<p>head.</p>\n<p>“If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make</p>\n<p>_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it</p>\n<p>must make me smaller, I suppose.”</p>\n<p>So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she</p>\n<p>began shrinking directly.</p>\n<p>As soon as she was small enough to get</p>\n",
        "<p>through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of</p>\n<p>little animals and birds waiting outside.</p>\n<p>The poor little Lizard, Bill,</p>\n<p>was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it</p>\n<p>something out of a bottle.</p>\n<p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she</p>\n<p>appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself</p>\n",
        "<p>safe in a thick wood.</p>\n<p>“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she</p>\n<p>wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the</p>\n<p>second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p>\n<p>I think that</p>\n<p>will be the best plan.”</p>\n<p>It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply</p>\n",
        "<p>arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea</p>\n<p>how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among</p>\n<p>the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a</p>\n<p>great hurry.</p>\n<p>An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and</p>\n<p>feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p>\n<p>“Poor little</p>\n",
        "<p>thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to</p>\n<p>it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it</p>\n<p>might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in</p>\n<p>spite of all her coaxing.</p>\n<p>Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and</p>\n<p>held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off</p>\n<p>all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,</p>\n",
        "<p>and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,</p>\n<p>to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the</p>\n<p>other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head</p>\n<p>over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was</p>\n<p>very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p>\n<p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then</p>\n<p>the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very</p>\n",
        "<p>little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely</p>\n<p>all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with</p>\n<p>its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p>\n<p>This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she</p>\n<p>set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,</p>\n<p>and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.</p>\n<p>“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant</p>\n",
        "<p>against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the</p>\n<p>leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d</p>\n<p>only been the right size to do it!</p>\n<p>Oh dear!</p>\n<p>I’d nearly forgotten that</p>\n<p>I’ve got to grow up again!</p>\n<p>Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed?</p>\n",
        "<p>I</p>\n<p>suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great</p>\n<p>question is, what?”</p>\n<p>The great question certainly was, what?</p>\n<p>Alice looked all round her at</p>\n<p>the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that</p>\n<p>looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as</p>\n<p>herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and</p>\n<p>behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what</p>\n<p>was on the top of it.</p>\n<p>She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the</p>\n<p>mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue</p>\n<p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly</p>\n",
        "<p>smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of</p>\n<p>anything else.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>\n<p>Advice from a Caterpillar</p>\n<p>The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p>\n<p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and</p>\n<p>addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.</p>\n<p>Alice replied,</p>\n<p>rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know</p>\n<p>who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been</p>\n<p>changed several times since then.”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Explain</p>\n<p>yourself!”</p>\n<p>“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m</p>\n<p>not myself, you see.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,</p>\n<p>“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many</p>\n",
        "<p>different sizes in a day is very confusing.”</p>\n<p>“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you</p>\n<p>have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then</p>\n<p>after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little</p>\n<p>queer, won’t you?”</p>\n<p>“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know</p>\n<p>is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”</p>\n<p>“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously.</p>\n<p>“Who are _you?_”</p>\n<p>Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.</p>\n<p>Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_</p>\n<p>short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I</p>\n",
        "<p>think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any</p>\n<p>good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant</p>\n<p>state of mind, she turned away.</p>\n<p>“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her.</p>\n<p>“I’ve something</p>\n",
        "<p>important to say!”</p>\n<p>This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.</p>\n<p>“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she</p>\n<p>could.</p>\n<p>“No,” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,</p>\n",
        "<p>and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.</p>\n<p>For</p>\n<p>some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded</p>\n<p>its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you</p>\n<p>think you’re changed, do you?”</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I</p>\n<p>used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all</p>\n<p>came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p>\n<p>“Repeat, ‘_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>Alice folded her hands, and began:—</p>\n<p>“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,</p>\n<p>“And your hair has become very white;</p>\n",
        "<p>And yet you incessantly stand on your head—</p>\n<p>Do you think, at your age, it is right?”</p>\n<p>“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,</p>\n<p>“I feared it might injure the brain;</p>\n<p>But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,</p>\n<p>Why, I do it again and again.”</p>\n<p>“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,</p>\n",
        "<p>And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p>\n<p>Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—</p>\n<p>Pray, what is the reason of that?”</p>\n<p>“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p>\n<p>“I kept all my limbs very supple</p>\n<p>By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—</p>\n<p>Allow me to sell you a couple?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak</p>\n<p>For anything tougher than suet;</p>\n<p>Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—</p>\n<p>Pray, how did you manage to do it?”</p>\n<p>“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,</p>\n<p>And argued each case with my wife;</p>\n<p>And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p>\n",
        "<p>Has lasted the rest of my life.”</p>\n<p>“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose</p>\n<p>That your eye was as steady as ever;</p>\n<p>Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—</p>\n<p>What made you so awfully clever?”</p>\n<p>“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”</p>\n<p>Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!</p>\n",
        "<p>Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p>\n<p>Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”</p>\n<p>“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the</p>\n<p>words have got altered.”</p>\n<p>“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,</p>\n<p>and there was silence for some minutes.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p>\n<p>“What size do you want to be?” it asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one</p>\n<p>doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”</p>\n<p>“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life</p>\n<p>before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.</p>\n<p>“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t</p>\n<p>mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”</p>\n<p>“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,</p>\n<p>rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).</p>\n<p>“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p>\n<p>And she</p>\n",
        "<p>thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily</p>\n<p>offended!”</p>\n<p>“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the</p>\n<p>hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p>\n<p>This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p>\n<p>In a</p>\n<p>minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and</p>\n",
        "<p>yawned once or twice, and shook itself.</p>\n<p>Then it got down off the</p>\n<p>mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,</p>\n<p>“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you</p>\n<p>grow shorter.”</p>\n<p>“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it</p>\n<p>aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p>\n<p>Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,</p>\n<p>trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was</p>\n<p>perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p>\n<p>However, at</p>\n<p>last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke</p>\n",
        "<p>off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p>\n<p>“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of</p>\n<p>the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a</p>\n<p>violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!</p>\n<p>She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt</p>\n<p>that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she</p>\n<p>set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p>\n",
        "<p>Her chin was pressed</p>\n<p>so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her</p>\n<p>mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the</p>\n<p>lefthand bit.</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n<p>*      *      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n",
        "<p>“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which</p>\n<p>changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders</p>\n<p>were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was</p>\n<p>an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a</p>\n<p>sea of green leaves that lay far below her.</p>\n<p>“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“And where _have_ my</p>\n",
        "<p>shoulders got to?</p>\n<p>And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”</p>\n<p>She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,</p>\n<p>except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.</p>\n<p>As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,</p>\n<p>she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that</p>\n<p>her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.</p>\n",
        "<p>She</p>\n<p>had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was</p>\n<p>going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but</p>\n<p>the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp</p>\n<p>hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her</p>\n<p>face, and was beating her violently with its wings.</p>\n<p>“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Let me alone!”</p>\n<p>“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued</p>\n<p>tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing</p>\n<p>seems to suit them!”</p>\n<p>“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried</p>\n",
        "<p>hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those</p>\n<p>serpents!</p>\n<p>There’s no pleasing them!”</p>\n<p>Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in</p>\n<p>saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p>\n<p>“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;</p>\n<p>“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!</p>\n",
        "<p>Why, I</p>\n<p>haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”</p>\n<p>“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to</p>\n<p>see its meaning.</p>\n<p>“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the</p>\n<p>Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I</p>\n<p>should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down</p>\n",
        "<p>from the sky!</p>\n<p>Ugh, Serpent!”</p>\n<p>“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“I’m a—I’m a—”</p>\n<p>“Well!</p>\n<p>_What_ are you?” said the Pigeon.</p>\n<p>“I can see you’re trying to</p>\n",
        "<p>invent something!”</p>\n<p>“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered</p>\n<p>the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p>\n<p>“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest</p>\n<p>contempt.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never</p>\n<p>_one_ with such a neck as that!</p>\n",
        "<p>No, no!</p>\n<p>You’re a serpent; and there’s</p>\n<p>no use denying it.</p>\n<p>I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never</p>\n<p>tasted an egg!”</p>\n<p>“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful</p>\n<p>child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you</p>\n",
        "<p>know.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then</p>\n<p>they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”</p>\n<p>This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a</p>\n<p>minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re</p>\n<p>looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to</p>\n<p>me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not</p>\n<p>looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want</p>\n<p>_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”</p>\n<p>“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled</p>\n<p>down again into its nest.</p>\n<p>Alice crouched down among the trees as well</p>\n<p>as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,</p>\n",
        "<p>and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.</p>\n<p>After a while</p>\n<p>she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,</p>\n<p>and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at</p>\n<p>the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until</p>\n<p>she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p>\n<p>It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it</p>\n",
        "<p>felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,</p>\n<p>and began talking to herself, as usual.</p>\n<p>“Come, there’s half my plan</p>\n<p>done now!</p>\n<p>How puzzling all these changes are!</p>\n<p>I’m never sure what I’m</p>\n<p>going to be, from one minute to another!</p>\n",
        "<p>However, I’ve got back to my</p>\n<p>right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how</p>\n<p>_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly</p>\n<p>upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p>\n<p>“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them</p>\n<p>_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she</p>\n<p>began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go</p>\n",
        "<p>near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>\n<p>Pig and Pepper</p>\n<p>For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what</p>\n<p>to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the</p>\n<p>wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:</p>\n<p>otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a</p>\n",
        "<p>fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.</p>\n<p>It was opened by</p>\n<p>another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a</p>\n<p>frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled</p>\n<p>all over their heads.</p>\n<p>She felt very curious to know what it was all</p>\n<p>about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,</p>\n<p>nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,</p>\n<p>saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess.</p>\n<p>An invitation from the</p>\n<p>Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn</p>\n<p>tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.</p>\n<p>An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.</p>\n<p>Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood</p>\n<p>for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the</p>\n<p>Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the</p>\n<p>door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p>\n<p>Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p>\n<p>“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for</p>\n",
        "<p>two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you</p>\n<p>are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could</p>\n<p>possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary</p>\n<p>noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now</p>\n<p>and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to</p>\n<p>pieces.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”</p>\n<p>“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on</p>\n<p>without attending to her, “if we had the door between us.</p>\n<p>For instance,</p>\n<p>if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you</p>\n<p>know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and</p>\n<p>this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.</p>\n",
        "<p>“But perhaps he can’t help it,”</p>\n<p>she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his</p>\n<p>head.</p>\n<p>But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”</p>\n<p>she repeated, aloud.</p>\n<p>“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”</p>\n<p>At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came</p>\n",
        "<p>skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,</p>\n<p>and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.</p>\n<p>“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly</p>\n<p>as if nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p>\n<p>“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman.</p>\n<p>“That’s the first</p>\n",
        "<p>question, you know.”</p>\n<p>It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p>\n<p>“It’s really</p>\n<p>dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.</p>\n<p>It’s enough to drive one crazy!”</p>\n<p>The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his</p>\n<p>remark, with variations.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for</p>\n<p>days and days.”</p>\n<p>“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s</p>\n<p>perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.</p>\n<p>The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from</p>\n",
        "<p>one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool</p>\n<p>in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,</p>\n<p>stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.</p>\n<p>“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to</p>\n<p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p>\n<p>There was certainly too much of it in the air.</p>\n<p>Even the Duchess sneezed</p>\n",
        "<p>occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling</p>\n<p>alternately without a moment’s pause.</p>\n<p>The only things in the kitchen</p>\n<p>that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting</p>\n<p>on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.</p>\n<p>“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was</p>\n<p>not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why</p>\n",
        "<p>your cat grins like that?”</p>\n<p>“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why.</p>\n<p>Pig!”</p>\n<p>She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite</p>\n<p>jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the</p>\n<p>baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t</p>\n",
        "<p>know that cats _could_ grin.”</p>\n<p>“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite</p>\n<p>pleased to have got into a conversation.</p>\n<p>“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”</p>\n<p>Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would</p>\n<p>be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.</p>\n",
        "<p>While she</p>\n<p>was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the</p>\n<p>fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at</p>\n<p>the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a</p>\n<p>shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.</p>\n<p>The Duchess took no notice of</p>\n<p>them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,</p>\n",
        "<p>that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p>\n<p>“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down</p>\n<p>in an agony of terror.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an</p>\n<p>unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it</p>\n<p>off.</p>\n<p>“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse</p>\n",
        "<p>growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”</p>\n<p>“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to</p>\n<p>get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.</p>\n<p>“Just</p>\n<p>think of what work it would make with the day and night!</p>\n<p>You see the</p>\n<p>earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”</p>\n<p>Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take</p>\n<p>the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to</p>\n<p>be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or</p>\n<p>is it twelve?</p>\n<p>I—”</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide</p>\n",
        "<p>figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a</p>\n<p>sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at</p>\n<p>the end of every line:</p>\n<p>“Speak roughly to your little boy,</p>\n<p>And beat him when he sneezes:</p>\n<p>He only does it to annoy,</p>\n<p>Because he knows it teases.”</p>\n",
        "<p>CHORUS.</p>\n<p>(In which the cook and the baby joined):</p>\n<p>“Wow!</p>\n<p>wow!</p>\n<p>wow!”</p>\n<p>While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing</p>\n<p>the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,</p>\n",
        "<p>that Alice could hardly hear the words:—</p>\n<p>“I speak severely to my boy,</p>\n<p>I beat him when he sneezes;</p>\n<p>For he can thoroughly enjoy</p>\n<p>The pepper when he pleases!”</p>\n<p>CHORUS.</p>\n<p>“Wow!</p>\n",
        "<p>wow!</p>\n<p>wow!”</p>\n<p>“Here!</p>\n<p>you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,</p>\n<p>flinging the baby at her as she spoke.</p>\n<p>“I must go and get ready to play</p>\n<p>croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room.</p>\n",
        "<p>The cook</p>\n<p>threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.</p>\n<p>Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped</p>\n<p>little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,</p>\n<p>“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice.</p>\n<p>The poor little thing was</p>\n<p>snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling</p>\n",
        "<p>itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for</p>\n<p>the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.</p>\n<p>As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to</p>\n<p>twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right</p>\n<p>ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it</p>\n<p>out into the open air.</p>\n<p>“If I don’t take this child away with me,”</p>\n",
        "<p>thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be</p>\n<p>murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the</p>\n<p>little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).</p>\n<p>“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of</p>\n<p>expressing yourself.”</p>\n<p>The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face</p>\n<p>to see what was the matter with it.</p>\n",
        "<p>There could be no doubt that it had</p>\n<p>a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also</p>\n<p>its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did</p>\n<p>not like the look of the thing at all.</p>\n<p>“But perhaps it was only</p>\n<p>sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there</p>\n<p>were any tears.</p>\n",
        "<p>No, there were no tears.</p>\n<p>“If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”</p>\n<p>said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you.</p>\n<p>Mind</p>\n<p>now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible</p>\n<p>to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.</p>\n<p>Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do</p>\n",
        "<p>with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so</p>\n<p>violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.</p>\n<p>This time</p>\n<p>there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than</p>\n<p>a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it</p>\n<p>further.</p>\n<p>So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it</p>\n",
        "<p>trot away quietly into the wood.</p>\n<p>“If it had grown up,” she said to</p>\n<p>herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes</p>\n<p>rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other</p>\n<p>children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying</p>\n<p>to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she</p>\n<p>was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of</p>\n",
        "<p>a tree a few yards off.</p>\n<p>The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.</p>\n<p>It looked good-natured, she</p>\n<p>thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she</p>\n<p>felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p>\n<p>“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know</p>\n<p>whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little</p>\n",
        "<p>wider.</p>\n<p>“Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.</p>\n<p>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”</p>\n<p>“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.</p>\n<p>“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.</p>\n<p>“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long</p>\n<p>enough.”</p>\n<p>Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p>\n<p>question.</p>\n<p>“What sort of people live about here?”</p>\n<p>“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives</p>\n<p>a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a</p>\n",
        "<p>March Hare.</p>\n<p>Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”</p>\n<p>“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.</p>\n<p>“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here.</p>\n<p>I’m mad.</p>\n<p>You’re mad.”</p>\n<p>“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”</p>\n<p>Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how</p>\n<p>do you know that you’re mad?”</p>\n<p>“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad.</p>\n<p>You grant that?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose so,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,</p>\n",
        "<p>and wags its tail when it’s pleased.</p>\n<p>Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,</p>\n<p>and wag my tail when I’m angry.</p>\n<p>Therefore I’m mad.”</p>\n<p>“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Call it what you like,” said the Cat.</p>\n<p>“Do you play croquet with the</p>\n",
        "<p>Queen to-day?”</p>\n<p>“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited</p>\n<p>yet.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.</p>\n<p>Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer</p>\n<p>things happening.</p>\n<p>While she was looking at the place where it had been,</p>\n",
        "<p>it suddenly appeared again.</p>\n<p>“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat.</p>\n<p>“I’d nearly</p>\n<p>forgotten to ask.”</p>\n<p>“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back</p>\n<p>in a natural way.</p>\n<p>“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.</p>\n",
        "<p>Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not</p>\n<p>appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in</p>\n<p>which the March Hare was said to live.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen hatters before,” she</p>\n<p>said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and</p>\n<p>perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it</p>\n<p>was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat</p>\n",
        "<p>again, sitting on a branch of a tree.</p>\n<p>“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.</p>\n<p>“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing</p>\n<p>and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p>\n<p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which</p>\n<p>remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well!</p>\n<p>I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a</p>\n<p>grin without a cat!</p>\n<p>It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”</p>\n<p>She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of</p>\n<p>the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the</p>\n<p>chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.</p>\n",
        "<p>It</p>\n<p>was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had</p>\n<p>nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself</p>\n<p>to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather</p>\n<p>timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!</p>\n<p>I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>\n",
        "<p>A Mad Tea-Party</p>\n<p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the</p>\n<p>March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting</p>\n<p>between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a</p>\n<p>cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.</p>\n<p>“Very</p>\n<p>uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,</p>\n",
        "<p>I suppose it doesn’t mind.”</p>\n<p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at</p>\n<p>one corner of it: “No room!</p>\n<p>No room!” they cried out when they saw</p>\n<p>Alice coming.</p>\n<p>“There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and</p>\n<p>she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p>\n<p>Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.</p>\n<p>“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.</p>\n<p>“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.</p>\n<p>“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said</p>\n<p>the March Hare.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great</p>\n<p>many more than three.”</p>\n<p>“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter.</p>\n<p>He had been looking at</p>\n<p>Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first</p>\n<p>speech.</p>\n<p>“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some</p>\n",
        "<p>severity; “it’s very rude.”</p>\n<p>The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_</p>\n<p>was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”</p>\n<p>“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad they’ve</p>\n<p>begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.</p>\n<p>“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said</p>\n",
        "<p>the March Hare.</p>\n<p>“Exactly so,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.</p>\n<p>“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I</p>\n<p>say—that’s the same thing, you know.”</p>\n<p>“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter.</p>\n<p>“You might just as well</p>\n",
        "<p>say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”</p>\n<p>“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what</p>\n<p>I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”</p>\n<p>“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be</p>\n<p>talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing</p>\n<p>as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”</p>\n<p>“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the</p>\n",
        "<p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while</p>\n<p>Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p>\n<p>writing-desks, which wasn’t much.</p>\n<p>The Hatter was the first to break the silence.</p>\n<p>“What day of the month</p>\n<p>is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his</p>\n<p>pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,</p>\n",
        "<p>and holding it to his ear.</p>\n<p>Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”</p>\n<p>“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter.</p>\n<p>“I told you butter wouldn’t suit</p>\n<p>the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.</p>\n<p>“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.</p>\n<p>“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:</p>\n",
        "<p>“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”</p>\n<p>The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped</p>\n<p>it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of</p>\n<p>nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,</p>\n<p>you know.”</p>\n<p>Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p>\n<p>“What a</p>\n",
        "<p>funny watch!” she remarked.</p>\n<p>“It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t</p>\n<p>tell what o’clock it is!”</p>\n<p>“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter.</p>\n<p>“Does _your_ watch tell you what</p>\n<p>year it is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it</p>\n",
        "<p>stays the same year for such a long time together.”</p>\n<p>“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.</p>\n<p>Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no</p>\n<p>sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p>\n<p>“I don’t quite</p>\n<p>understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.</p>\n<p>“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little</p>\n",
        "<p>hot tea upon its nose.</p>\n<p>The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its</p>\n<p>eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”</p>\n<p>“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”</p>\n<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Nor I,” said the March Hare.</p>\n<p>Alice sighed wearily.</p>\n<p>“I think you might do something better with the</p>\n<p>time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no</p>\n<p>answers.”</p>\n<p>“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk</p>\n<p>about wasting _it_.</p>\n",
        "<p>It’s _him_.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head</p>\n<p>contemptuously.</p>\n<p>“I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat</p>\n<p>time when I learn music.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ah!</p>\n<p>that accounts for it,” said the Hatter.</p>\n<p>“He won’t stand beating.</p>\n<p>Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything</p>\n<p>you liked with the clock.</p>\n<p>For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in</p>\n<p>the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a</p>\n",
        "<p>hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!</p>\n<p>Half-past one,</p>\n<p>time for dinner!”</p>\n<p>(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)</p>\n<p>“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I</p>\n<p>shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”</p>\n<p>“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to</p>\n",
        "<p>half-past one as long as you liked.”</p>\n<p>“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.</p>\n<p>The Hatter shook his head mournfully.</p>\n<p>“Not I!” he replied.</p>\n<p>“We</p>\n<p>quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing</p>\n<p>with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert</p>\n",
        "<p>given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p>\n<p>‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p>\n<p>How I wonder what you’re at!’</p>\n<p>You know the song, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—</p>\n<p>‘Up above the world you fly,</p>\n",
        "<p>Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p>\n<p>Twinkle, twinkle—’”</p>\n<p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p>\n<p>“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they</p>\n<p>had to pinch it to make it stop.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the</p>\n<p>Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time!</p>\n",
        "<p>Off with his</p>\n<p>head!’”</p>\n<p>“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.</p>\n<p>“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t</p>\n<p>do a thing I ask!</p>\n<p>It’s always six o’clock now.”</p>\n<p>A bright idea came into Alice’s head.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Is that the reason so many</p>\n<p>tea-things are put out here?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,</p>\n<p>and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”</p>\n<p>“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”</p>\n<p>“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured</p>\n",
        "<p>to ask.</p>\n<p>“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.</p>\n<p>“I’m getting tired of this.</p>\n<p>I vote the young lady tells us a story.”</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the</p>\n<p>proposal.</p>\n<p>“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Wake up, Dormouse!” And</p>\n<p>they pinched it on both sides at once.</p>\n<p>The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a</p>\n<p>hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”</p>\n<p>“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.</p>\n<p>“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again</p>\n<p>before it’s done.”</p>\n<p>“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began</p>\n<p>in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and</p>\n<p>they lived at the bottom of a well—”</p>\n<p>“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest</p>\n<p>in questions of eating and drinking.</p>\n",
        "<p>“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or</p>\n<p>two.</p>\n<p>“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;</p>\n<p>“they’d have been ill.”</p>\n<p>“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”</p>\n<p>Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of</p>\n<p>living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But</p>\n",
        "<p>why did they live at the bottom of a well?”</p>\n<p>“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t</p>\n<p>take more.”</p>\n<p>“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to</p>\n<p>take _more_ than nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.</p>\n<p>Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to</p>\n<p>some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and</p>\n<p>repeated her question.</p>\n<p>“Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”</p>\n<p>The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then</p>\n<p>said, “It was a treacle-well.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the</p>\n<p>Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh!</p>\n<p>sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily</p>\n<p>remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for</p>\n<p>yourself.”</p>\n<p>“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n",
        "<p>dare say there may be _one_.”</p>\n<p>“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly.</p>\n<p>However, he consented to</p>\n<p>go on.</p>\n<p>“And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,</p>\n<p>you know—”</p>\n<p>“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.</p>\n<p>“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place</p>\n<p>on.”</p>\n<p>He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare</p>\n<p>moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the</p>\n<p>place of the March Hare.</p>\n<p>The Hatter was the only one who got any</p>\n",
        "<p>advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than</p>\n<p>before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.</p>\n<p>Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very</p>\n<p>cautiously: “But I don’t understand.</p>\n<p>Where did they draw the treacle</p>\n<p>from?”</p>\n<p>“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should</p>\n",
        "<p>think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”</p>\n<p>“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing</p>\n<p>to notice this last remark.</p>\n<p>“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”</p>\n<p>This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for</p>\n<p>some time without interrupting it.</p>\n<p>“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing</p>\n",
        "<p>its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of</p>\n<p>things—everything that begins with an M—”</p>\n<p>“Why with an M?” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Why not?” said the March Hare.</p>\n<p>Alice was silent.</p>\n<p>The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a</p>\n<p>doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a</p>\n",
        "<p>little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as</p>\n<p>mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say</p>\n<p>things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a</p>\n<p>drawing of a muchness?”</p>\n<p>“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t</p>\n<p>think—”</p>\n<p>“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.</p>\n",
        "<p>This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in</p>\n<p>great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and</p>\n<p>neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she</p>\n<p>looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:</p>\n<p>the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into</p>\n<p>the teapot.</p>\n<p>“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her</p>\n",
        "<p>way through the wood.</p>\n<p>“It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in</p>\n<p>all my life!”</p>\n<p>Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door</p>\n<p>leading right into it.</p>\n<p>“That’s very curious!” she thought.</p>\n<p>“But</p>\n",
        "<p>everything’s curious today.</p>\n<p>I think I may as well go in at once.” And</p>\n<p>in she went.</p>\n<p>Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little</p>\n<p>glass table.</p>\n<p>“Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,</p>\n<p>and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that</p>\n",
        "<p>led into the garden.</p>\n<p>Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom</p>\n<p>(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot</p>\n<p>high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found</p>\n<p>herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds</p>\n<p>and the cool fountains.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>\n",
        "<p>The Queen’s Croquet-Ground</p>\n<p>A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses</p>\n<p>growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily</p>\n<p>painting them red.</p>\n<p>Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she</p>\n<p>went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard</p>\n<p>one of them say, “Look out now, Five!</p>\n",
        "<p>Don’t go splashing paint over me</p>\n<p>like that!”</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my</p>\n<p>elbow.”</p>\n<p>On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five!</p>\n<p>Always lay the</p>\n<p>blame on others!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five.</p>\n<p>“I heard the Queen say only</p>\n<p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”</p>\n<p>“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.</p>\n<p>“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.</p>\n<p>“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for</p>\n<p>bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust</p>\n<p>things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching</p>\n<p>them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,</p>\n<p>and all of them bowed low.</p>\n<p>“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are</p>\n<p>painting those roses?”</p>\n<p>Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.</p>\n",
        "<p>Two began in a low</p>\n<p>voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a</p>\n<p>_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen</p>\n<p>was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this</p>\n<p>moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called</p>\n",
        "<p>out “The Queen!</p>\n<p>The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw</p>\n<p>themselves flat upon their faces.</p>\n<p>There was a sound of many footsteps,</p>\n<p>and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p>\n<p>First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the</p>\n<p>three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the</p>\n",
        "<p>corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with</p>\n<p>diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.</p>\n<p>After these came</p>\n<p>the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came</p>\n<p>jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all</p>\n<p>ornamented with hearts.</p>\n<p>Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,</p>\n",
        "<p>and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a</p>\n<p>hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went</p>\n<p>by without noticing her.</p>\n<p>Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying</p>\n<p>the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p>\n<p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p>\n<p>Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face</p>\n",
        "<p>like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard</p>\n<p>of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a</p>\n<p>procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their</p>\n<p>faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,</p>\n<p>and waited.</p>\n<p>When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked</p>\n<p>at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the</p>\n",
        "<p>Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p>\n<p>“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to</p>\n<p>Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”</p>\n<p>“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;</p>\n<p>but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after</p>\n<p>all.</p>\n<p>I needn’t be afraid of them!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners</p>\n<p>who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on</p>\n<p>their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of</p>\n<p>the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,</p>\n<p>or courtiers, or three of her own children.</p>\n<p>“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p>\n<p>“It’s</p>\n",
        "<p>no business of _mine_.”</p>\n<p>The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a</p>\n<p>moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head!</p>\n<p>Off—”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was</p>\n<p>silent.</p>\n<p>The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my</p>\n",
        "<p>dear: she is only a child!”</p>\n<p>The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn</p>\n<p>them over!”</p>\n<p>The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p>\n<p>“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three</p>\n<p>gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,</p>\n<p>the royal children, and everybody else.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen.</p>\n<p>“You make me giddy.” And then,</p>\n<p>turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing</p>\n<p>here?”</p>\n<p>“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going</p>\n<p>down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”</p>\n<p>“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the</p>\n<p>soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran</p>\n<p>to Alice for protection.</p>\n<p>“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large</p>\n<p>flower-pot that stood near.</p>\n<p>The three soldiers wandered about for a</p>\n<p>minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the</p>\n",
        "<p>others.</p>\n<p>“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.</p>\n<p>“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted</p>\n<p>in reply.</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” shouted the Queen.</p>\n<p>“Can you play croquet?”</p>\n<p>The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was</p>\n",
        "<p>evidently meant for her.</p>\n<p>“Yes!” shouted Alice.</p>\n<p>“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,</p>\n<p>wondering very much what would happen next.</p>\n<p>“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side.</p>\n<p>She was</p>\n<p>walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”</p>\n<p>“Hush!</p>\n<p>Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.</p>\n<p>He looked</p>\n<p>anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon</p>\n<p>tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under</p>\n<p>sentence of execution.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“What for?” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.</p>\n<p>“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity.</p>\n<p>I said</p>\n<p>‘What for?’”</p>\n<p>“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began.</p>\n<p>Alice gave a little</p>\n",
        "<p>scream of laughter.</p>\n<p>“Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened</p>\n<p>tone.</p>\n<p>“The Queen will hear you!</p>\n<p>You see, she came rather late, and the</p>\n<p>Queen said—”</p>\n<p>“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and</p>\n",
        "<p>people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each</p>\n<p>other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game</p>\n<p>began.</p>\n<p>Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground</p>\n<p>in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live</p>\n<p>hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double</p>\n<p>themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p>\n",
        "<p>The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:</p>\n<p>she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,</p>\n<p>under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she</p>\n<p>had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the</p>\n<p>hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look</p>\n<p>up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help</p>\n<p>bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was</p>\n",
        "<p>going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog</p>\n<p>had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all</p>\n<p>this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p>\n<p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were</p>\n<p>always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice</p>\n<p>soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.</p>\n<p>The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling</p>\n",
        "<p>all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time</p>\n<p>the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and</p>\n<p>shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a</p>\n<p>minute.</p>\n<p>Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any</p>\n<p>dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,</p>\n<p>“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me?</p>\n",
        "<p>They’re dreadfully</p>\n<p>fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any</p>\n<p>one left alive!”</p>\n<p>She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she</p>\n<p>could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious</p>\n<p>appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after</p>\n<p>watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said</p>\n",
        "<p>to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk</p>\n<p>to.”</p>\n<p>“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth</p>\n<p>enough for it to speak with.</p>\n<p>Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.</p>\n<p>“It’s no use</p>\n<p>speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one</p>\n",
        "<p>of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put</p>\n<p>down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad</p>\n<p>she had someone to listen to her.</p>\n<p>The Cat seemed to think that there</p>\n<p>was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a</p>\n<p>complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear</p>\n",
        "<p>oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at</p>\n<p>least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how</p>\n<p>confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the</p>\n<p>arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the</p>\n<p>ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only</p>\n<p>it ran away when it saw mine coming!”</p>\n<p>“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed</p>\n<p>that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,</p>\n<p>“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”</p>\n<p>The Queen smiled and passed on.</p>\n<p>“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and</p>\n<p>looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.</p>\n<p>“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to</p>\n",
        "<p>introduce it.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may</p>\n<p>kiss my hand if it likes.”</p>\n<p>“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like</p>\n<p>that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p>\n<p>“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I’ve read that in some book,</p>\n<p>but I don’t remember where.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called</p>\n<p>the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear!</p>\n<p>I wish you would</p>\n<p>have this cat removed!”</p>\n<p>The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or</p>\n",
        "<p>small.</p>\n<p>“Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.</p>\n<p>“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he</p>\n<p>hurried off.</p>\n<p>Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going</p>\n<p>on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with</p>\n<p>passion.</p>\n",
        "<p>She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be</p>\n<p>executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look</p>\n<p>of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew</p>\n<p>whether it was her turn or not.</p>\n<p>So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p>\n<p>The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed</p>\n<p>to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the</p>\n",
        "<p>other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to</p>\n<p>the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a</p>\n<p>helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.</p>\n<p>By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight</p>\n<p>was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t</p>\n<p>matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side</p>\n<p>of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not</p>\n",
        "<p>escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her</p>\n<p>friend.</p>\n<p>When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite</p>\n<p>a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between</p>\n<p>the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,</p>\n<p>while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle</p>\n",
        "<p>the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they</p>\n<p>all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly</p>\n<p>what they said.</p>\n<p>The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless</p>\n<p>there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a</p>\n<p>thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.</p>\n<p>The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p>\n",
        "<p>beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.</p>\n<p>The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in</p>\n<p>less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round.</p>\n<p>(It was</p>\n<p>this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and</p>\n<p>anxious.)</p>\n<p>Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the</p>\n",
        "<p>Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”</p>\n<p>“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”</p>\n<p>And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p>\n<p>The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the</p>\n<p>time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so</p>\n<p>the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,</p>\n<p>while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p>\n",
        "<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>\n<p>The Mock Turtle’s Story</p>\n<p>“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”</p>\n<p>said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,</p>\n<p>and they walked off together.</p>\n<p>Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought</p>\n<p>to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so</p>\n",
        "<p>savage when they met in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful</p>\n<p>tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_.</p>\n<p>Soup</p>\n<p>does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people</p>\n<p>hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new</p>\n<p>kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes</p>\n",
        "<p>them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children</p>\n<p>sweet-tempered.</p>\n<p>I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be</p>\n<p>so stingy about it, you know—”</p>\n<p>She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little</p>\n<p>startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p>\n<p>“You’re thinking</p>\n",
        "<p>about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.</p>\n<p>I can’t</p>\n<p>tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in</p>\n<p>a bit.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.</p>\n<p>“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess.</p>\n<p>“Everything’s got a moral, if only</p>\n",
        "<p>you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as</p>\n<p>she spoke.</p>\n<p>Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the</p>\n<p>Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the</p>\n<p>right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an</p>\n<p>uncomfortably sharp chin.</p>\n<p>However, she did not like to be rude, so she</p>\n",
        "<p>bore it as well as she could.</p>\n<p>“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up</p>\n<p>the conversation a little.</p>\n<p>“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,</p>\n<p>’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”</p>\n<p>“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding</p>\n<p>their own business!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ah, well!</p>\n<p>It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her</p>\n<p>sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of</p>\n<p>_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of</p>\n<p>themselves.’”</p>\n<p>“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”</p>\n<p>the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about</p>\n<p>the temper of your flamingo.</p>\n<p>Shall I try the experiment?”</p>\n<p>“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious</p>\n<p>to have the experiment tried.</p>\n<p>“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite.</p>\n",
        "<p>And</p>\n<p>the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”</p>\n<p>“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.</p>\n<p>“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of</p>\n<p>putting things!”</p>\n<p>“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to</p>\n",
        "<p>everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.</p>\n<p>And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is</p>\n<p>of yours.’”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last</p>\n<p>remark, “it’s a vegetable.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”</p>\n<p>“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that</p>\n",
        "<p>is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more</p>\n<p>simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might</p>\n<p>appear to others that what you were or might have been was not</p>\n<p>otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be</p>\n<p>otherwise.’”</p>\n<p>“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,</p>\n<p>“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,</p>\n<p>in a pleased tone.</p>\n<p>“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said</p>\n<p>Alice.</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess.</p>\n<p>“I make you a present</p>\n<p>of everything I’ve said as yet.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad they don’t give</p>\n<p>birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out</p>\n<p>loud.</p>\n<p>“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp</p>\n<p>little chin.</p>\n<p>“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to</p>\n",
        "<p>feel a little worried.</p>\n<p>“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and</p>\n<p>the m—”</p>\n<p>But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,</p>\n<p>even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was</p>\n<p>linked into hers began to tremble.</p>\n<p>Alice looked up, and there stood the</p>\n",
        "<p>Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a</p>\n<p>thunderstorm.</p>\n<p>“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.</p>\n<p>“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the</p>\n<p>ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in</p>\n<p>about half no time!</p>\n<p>Take your choice!”</p>\n",
        "<p>The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too</p>\n<p>much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the</p>\n<p>croquet-ground.</p>\n<p>The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were</p>\n<p>resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried</p>\n<p>back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay</p>\n",
        "<p>would cost them their lives.</p>\n<p>All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling</p>\n<p>with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with</p>\n<p>her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the</p>\n<p>soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so</p>\n<p>that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and</p>\n<p>all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody</p>\n",
        "<p>and under sentence of execution.</p>\n<p>Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have</p>\n<p>you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”</p>\n<p>“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.</p>\n<p>“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history.”</p>\n<p>As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,</p>\n<p>to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a</p>\n<p>good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the</p>\n<p>number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p>\n<p>They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.</p>\n<p>(If</p>\n",
        "<p>you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy</p>\n<p>thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock</p>\n<p>Turtle, and to hear his history.</p>\n<p>I must go back and see after some</p>\n<p>executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone</p>\n<p>with the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,</p>\n",
        "<p>but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it</p>\n<p>as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.</p>\n<p>The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till</p>\n<p>she was out of sight: then it chuckled.</p>\n<p>“What fun!” said the Gryphon,</p>\n<p>half to itself, half to Alice.</p>\n<p>“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“It’s all her fancy, that: they never</p>\n<p>executes nobody, you know.</p>\n<p>Come on!”</p>\n<p>“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly</p>\n<p>after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”</p>\n<p>They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,</p>\n",
        "<p>sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came</p>\n<p>nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>pitied him deeply.</p>\n<p>“What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the</p>\n<p>Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all</p>\n<p>his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know.</p>\n",
        "<p>Come on!”</p>\n<p>So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes</p>\n<p>full of tears, but said nothing.</p>\n<p>“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your</p>\n<p>history, she do.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit</p>\n<p>down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.</p>\n<p>Alice thought to</p>\n<p>herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”</p>\n<p>But she waited patiently.</p>\n<p>“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real</p>\n<p>Turtle.”</p>\n<p>These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an</p>\n",
        "<p>occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant</p>\n<p>heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.</p>\n<p>Alice was very nearly getting up and</p>\n<p>saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not</p>\n<p>help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said</p>\n<p>nothing.</p>\n<p>“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,</p>\n",
        "<p>though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the</p>\n<p>sea.</p>\n<p>The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”</p>\n<p>“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.</p>\n<p>“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle</p>\n<p>angrily: “really you are very dull!”</p>\n<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p>\n",
        "<p>question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked</p>\n<p>at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.</p>\n<p>At last the</p>\n<p>Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow!</p>\n<p>Don’t be all</p>\n<p>day about it!” and he went on in these words:</p>\n<p>“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.</p>\n<p>“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.</p>\n<p>“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.</p>\n<p>The Mock Turtle went on.</p>\n<p>“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”</p>\n<p>“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so</p>\n<p>proud as all that.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”</p>\n<p>“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.</p>\n<p>“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Ah!</p>\n<p>then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a</p>\n<p>tone of great relief.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,</p>\n<p>‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”</p>\n<p>“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom</p>\n<p>of the sea.”</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.</p>\n<p>“I</p>\n<p>only took the regular course.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“What was that?” inquired Alice.</p>\n<p>“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle</p>\n<p>replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,</p>\n<p>Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”</p>\n<p>“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What!</p>\n<p>Never heard of</p>\n<p>uglifying!” it exclaimed.</p>\n<p>“You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify</p>\n<p>is, you _are_ a simpleton.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so</p>\n<p>she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”</p>\n<p>“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the</p>\n<p>subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with</p>\n<p>Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,</p>\n<p>that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and</p>\n<p>Fainting in Coils.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too</p>\n<p>stiff.</p>\n<p>And the Gryphon never learnt it.”</p>\n<p>“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,</p>\n<p>though.</p>\n<p>He was an old crab, _he_ was.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught</p>\n<p>Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”</p>\n<p>“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both</p>\n<p>creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p>\n<p>“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry</p>\n<p>to change the subject.</p>\n<p>“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so</p>\n",
        "<p>on.”</p>\n<p>“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.</p>\n<p>“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:</p>\n<p>“because they lessen from day to day.”</p>\n<p>This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little</p>\n<p>before she made her next remark.</p>\n<p>“Then the eleventh day must have been</p>\n",
        "<p>a holiday?”</p>\n<p>“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.</p>\n<p>“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.</p>\n<p>“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very</p>\n<p>decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>\n<p>The Lobster Quadrille</p>\n",
        "<p>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across</p>\n<p>his eyes.</p>\n<p>He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or</p>\n<p>two sobs choked his voice.</p>\n<p>“Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”</p>\n<p>said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in</p>\n<p>the back.</p>\n",
        "<p>At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears</p>\n<p>running down his cheeks, he went on again:—</p>\n<p>“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said</p>\n<p>Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”</p>\n<p>(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and</p>\n<p>said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a</p>\n<p>Lobster Quadrille is!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“No, indeed,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“What sort of a dance is it?”</p>\n<p>“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the</p>\n<p>sea-shore—”</p>\n<p>“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle.</p>\n<p>“Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p>\n<p>then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”</p>\n",
        "<p>“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“—you advance twice—”</p>\n<p>“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”</p>\n<p>“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”</p>\n<p>“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p>\n",
        "<p>“—as far out to sea as you can—”</p>\n<p>“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly</p>\n<p>about.</p>\n<p>“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p>\n<p>“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock</p>\n<p>Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had</p>\n",
        "<p>been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very</p>\n<p>sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p>\n<p>“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.</p>\n<p>“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.</p>\n<p>“Very much indeed,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the</p>\n<p>Gryphon.</p>\n",
        "<p>“We can do without lobsters, you know.</p>\n<p>Which shall sing?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“I’ve forgotten the words.”</p>\n<p>So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and</p>\n<p>then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their</p>\n<p>forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly</p>\n",
        "<p>and sadly:—</p>\n<p>“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.</p>\n<p>“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.</p>\n<p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p>\n<p>They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?</p>\n<p>Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?</p>\n<p>Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?</p>\n",
        "<p>“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p>\n<p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”</p>\n<p>But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—</p>\n<p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.</p>\n<p>Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.</p>\n<p>Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.</p>\n<p>“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.</p>\n",
        "<p>“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p>\n<p>The further off from England the nearer is to France—</p>\n<p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p>\n<p>Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?</p>\n<p>Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”</p>\n<p>“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,</p>\n<p>feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that</p>\n",
        "<p>curious song about the whiting!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,</p>\n<p>of course?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself</p>\n<p>hastily.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve</p>\n<p>seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>“They have their tails in</p>\n<p>their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”</p>\n<p>“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would</p>\n<p>all wash off in the sea.</p>\n<p>But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;</p>\n<p>and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his</p>\n",
        "<p>eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the</p>\n<p>lobsters to the dance.</p>\n<p>So they got thrown out to sea.</p>\n<p>So they had to</p>\n<p>fall a long way.</p>\n<p>So they got their tails fast in their mouths.</p>\n",
        "<p>So they</p>\n<p>couldn’t get them out again.</p>\n<p>That’s all.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting.</p>\n<p>I never knew so much</p>\n<p>about a whiting before.”</p>\n<p>“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Do you</p>\n<p>know why it’s called a whiting?”</p>\n<p>“I never thought about it,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.</p>\n<p>Alice was thoroughly puzzled.</p>\n<p>“Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated</p>\n",
        "<p>in a wondering tone.</p>\n<p>“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“I mean, what</p>\n<p>makes them so shiny?”</p>\n<p>Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her</p>\n<p>answer.</p>\n<p>“They’re done with blacking, I believe.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,</p>\n<p>“are done with a whiting.</p>\n<p>Now you know.”</p>\n<p>“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.</p>\n<p>“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:</p>\n<p>“any shrimp could have told you that.”</p>\n<p>“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still</p>\n",
        "<p>running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,</p>\n<p>please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”</p>\n<p>“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no</p>\n<p>wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”</p>\n<p>“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p>\n<p>“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,</p>\n<p>and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”</p>\n<p>“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said</p>\n<p>Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,</p>\n<p>because I was a different person then.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.</p>\n<p>“No, no!</p>\n<p>The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:</p>\n<p>“explanations take such a dreadful time.”</p>\n<p>So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first</p>\n<p>saw the White Rabbit.</p>\n<p>She was a little nervous about it just at first,</p>\n",
        "<p>the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened</p>\n<p>their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she</p>\n<p>went on.</p>\n<p>Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part</p>\n<p>about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the</p>\n<p>Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock</p>\n<p>Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>“I</p>\n<p>should like to hear her try and repeat something now.</p>\n<p>Tell her to</p>\n<p>begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of</p>\n<p>authority over Alice.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the</p>\n<p>Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”</p>\n<p>thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got</p>\n<p>up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster</p>\n<p>Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came</p>\n<p>very queer indeed:—</p>\n",
        "<p>“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p>\n<p>“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”</p>\n<p>As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p>\n<p>Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”</p>\n<p>[later editions continued as follows</p>\n<p>When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p>\n<p>And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p>\n",
        "<p>But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p>\n<p>His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p>\n<p>“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said</p>\n<p>the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds</p>\n<p>uncommon nonsense.”</p>\n<p>Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,</p>\n",
        "<p>wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.</p>\n<p>“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.</p>\n<p>“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily.</p>\n<p>“Go on with the next</p>\n<p>verse.”</p>\n<p>“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted.</p>\n<p>“How _could_ he turn</p>\n",
        "<p>them out with his nose, you know?”</p>\n<p>“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully</p>\n<p>puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.</p>\n<p>“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it</p>\n<p>begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”</p>\n<p>Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come</p>\n<p>wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—</p>\n",
        "<p>“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p>\n<p>How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”</p>\n<p>[later editions continued as follows</p>\n<p>The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p>\n<p>While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p>\n<p>When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p>\n<p>Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p>\n",
        "<p>While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p>\n<p>And concluded the banquet—]</p>\n<p>“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle</p>\n<p>interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on?</p>\n<p>It’s by far the</p>\n<p>most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was</p>\n",
        "<p>only too glad to do so.</p>\n<p>“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon</p>\n<p>went on.</p>\n<p>“Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice</p>\n<p>replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,</p>\n<p>“Hm!</p>\n",
        "<p>No accounting for tastes!</p>\n<p>Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old</p>\n<p>fellow?”</p>\n<p>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked</p>\n<p>with sobs, to sing this:—</p>\n<p>“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p>\n<p>Waiting in a hot tureen!</p>\n",
        "<p>Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p>\n<p>Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p>\n<p>Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p>\n<p>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!</p>\n<p>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!</p>\n<p>Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,</p>\n<p>Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p>\n",
        "<p>“Beautiful Soup!</p>\n<p>Who cares for fish,</p>\n<p>Game, or any other dish?</p>\n<p>Who would not give all else for two p</p>\n<p>ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p>\n<p>Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p>\n<p>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!</p>\n",
        "<p>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!</p>\n<p>Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,</p>\n<p>Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”</p>\n<p>“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun</p>\n<p>to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the</p>\n<p>distance.</p>\n<p>“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried</p>\n",
        "<p>off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p>\n<p>“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only</p>\n<p>answered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly</p>\n<p>came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—</p>\n<p>“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,</p>\n<p>Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>\n",
        "<p>Who Stole the Tarts?</p>\n<p>The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they</p>\n<p>arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little</p>\n<p>birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was</p>\n<p>standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard</p>\n<p>him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one</p>\n<p>hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.</p>\n",
        "<p>In the very middle of the</p>\n<p>court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so</p>\n<p>good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d</p>\n<p>get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”</p>\n<p>But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at</p>\n<p>everything about her, to pass away the time.</p>\n<p>Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read</p>\n",
        "<p>about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew</p>\n<p>the name of nearly everything there.</p>\n<p>“That’s the judge,” she said to</p>\n<p>herself, “because of his great wig.”</p>\n<p>The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the</p>\n<p>wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he</p>\n<p>did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.</p>\n",
        "<p>“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”</p>\n<p>(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were</p>\n<p>animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She</p>\n<p>said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather</p>\n<p>proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little</p>\n<p>girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.</p>\n<p>However, “jury-men”</p>\n",
        "<p>would have done just as well.</p>\n<p>The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p>\n<p>“What are</p>\n<p>they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon.</p>\n<p>“They can’t have anything</p>\n<p>to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”</p>\n<p>“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,</p>\n",
        "<p>“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”</p>\n<p>“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she</p>\n<p>stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the</p>\n<p>court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,</p>\n<p>to make out who was talking.</p>\n<p>Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,</p>\n<p>that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,</p>\n",
        "<p>and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell</p>\n<p>“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.</p>\n<p>“A nice</p>\n<p>muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.</p>\n<p>One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.</p>\n<p>This of course, Alice</p>\n<p>could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and</p>\n",
        "<p>very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.</p>\n<p>She did it so quickly</p>\n<p>that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out</p>\n<p>at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he</p>\n<p>was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this</p>\n<p>was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p>\n<p>“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.</p>\n",
        "<p>On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then</p>\n<p>unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—</p>\n<p>“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p>\n<p>All on a summer day:</p>\n<p>The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p>\n<p>And took them quite away!”</p>\n<p>“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted.</p>\n<p>“There’s a great</p>\n<p>deal to come before that!”</p>\n<p>“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew</p>\n<p>three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”</p>\n<p>The first witness was the Hatter.</p>\n<p>He came in with a teacup in one hand</p>\n",
        "<p>and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.</p>\n<p>“I beg pardon, your</p>\n<p>Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished</p>\n<p>my tea when I was sent for.”</p>\n<p>“You ought to have finished,” said the King.</p>\n<p>“When did you begin?”</p>\n<p>The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the</p>\n",
        "<p>court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.</p>\n<p>“Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it</p>\n<p>was,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.</p>\n<p>“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.</p>\n<p>“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly</p>\n<p>wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and</p>\n",
        "<p>reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p>\n<p>“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.</p>\n<p>“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made</p>\n<p>a memorandum of the fact.</p>\n<p>“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none</p>\n<p>of my own.</p>\n",
        "<p>I’m a hatter.”</p>\n<p>Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,</p>\n<p>who turned pale and fidgeted.</p>\n<p>“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll</p>\n<p>have you executed on the spot.”</p>\n<p>This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting</p>\n<p>from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his</p>\n",
        "<p>confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the</p>\n<p>bread-and-butter.</p>\n<p>Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled</p>\n<p>her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to</p>\n<p>grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave</p>\n<p>the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was</p>\n<p>as long as there was room for her.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting</p>\n<p>next to her.</p>\n<p>“I can hardly breathe.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”</p>\n<p>“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.</p>\n<p>“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing</p>\n<p>too.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in</p>\n<p>that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over</p>\n<p>to the other side of the court.</p>\n<p>All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,</p>\n<p>just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers</p>\n<p>of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”</p>\n<p>on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes</p>\n",
        "<p>off.</p>\n<p>“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you</p>\n<p>executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”</p>\n<p>“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,</p>\n<p>“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the</p>\n<p>bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”</p>\n<p>“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.</p>\n",
        "<p>“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.</p>\n<p>“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply.</p>\n<p>“Do you</p>\n<p>take me for a dunce?</p>\n<p>Go on!”</p>\n<p>“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after</p>\n<p>that—only the March Hare said—”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p>\n<p>“You did!” said the Hatter.</p>\n<p>“I deny it!” said the March Hare.</p>\n<p>“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”</p>\n<p>“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking</p>\n<p>anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied</p>\n<p>nothing, being fast asleep.</p>\n",
        "<p>“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”</p>\n<p>“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.</p>\n<p>“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.</p>\n<p>“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”</p>\n<p>The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went</p>\n<p>down on one knee.</p>\n<p>“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.</p>\n<p>Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by</p>\n<p>the officers of the court.</p>\n<p>(As that is rather a hard word, I will just</p>\n<p>explain to you how it was done.</p>\n<p>They had a large canvas bag, which tied</p>\n<p>up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,</p>\n",
        "<p>head first, and then sat upon it.)</p>\n<p>“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice.</p>\n<p>“I’ve so often read in</p>\n<p>the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at</p>\n<p>applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the</p>\n<p>court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the</p>\n",
        "<p>King.</p>\n<p>“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”</p>\n<p>“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.</p>\n<p>Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p>\n<p>“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice.</p>\n<p>“Now we shall get</p>\n<p>on better.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at</p>\n<p>the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p>\n<p>“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,</p>\n<p>without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p>\n<p>“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the</p>\n<p>officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get</p>\n<p>to the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Call the next witness!” said the King.</p>\n<p>The next witness was the Duchess’s cook.</p>\n<p>She carried the pepper-box in</p>\n<p>her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the</p>\n<p>court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.</p>\n<p>“Give your evidence,” said the King.</p>\n<p>“Shan’t,” said the cook.</p>\n",
        "<p>The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,</p>\n<p>“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”</p>\n<p>“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,</p>\n<p>after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were</p>\n<p>nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”</p>\n<p>“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.</p>\n<p>“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out.</p>\n<p>“Behead that Dormouse!</p>\n<p>Turn that Dormouse out of court!</p>\n<p>Suppress him!</p>\n<p>Pinch him!</p>\n<p>Off with his</p>\n<p>whiskers!”</p>\n",
        "<p>For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse</p>\n<p>turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had</p>\n<p>disappeared.</p>\n<p>“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief.</p>\n<p>“Call the</p>\n<p>next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my</p>\n<p>dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness.</p>\n",
        "<p>It quite makes my</p>\n<p>forehead ache!”</p>\n<p>Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling</p>\n<p>very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they</p>\n<p>haven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself.</p>\n<p>Imagine her</p>\n<p>surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill</p>\n",
        "<p>little voice, the name “Alice!”</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>\n<p>Alice’s Evidence</p>\n<p>“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how</p>\n<p>large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such</p>\n<p>a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,</p>\n<p>upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there</p>\n",
        "<p>they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of</p>\n<p>goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and</p>\n<p>began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident</p>\n<p>of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of</p>\n<p>idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the</p>\n<p>jury-box, or they would die.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until</p>\n<p>all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated</p>\n<p>with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.</p>\n<p>Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put</p>\n<p>the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its</p>\n<p>tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.</p>\n<p>She soon</p>\n",
        "<p>got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she</p>\n<p>said to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the</p>\n<p>trial one way up as the other.”</p>\n<p>As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being</p>\n<p>upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to</p>\n<p>them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the</p>\n<p>accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do</p>\n",
        "<p>anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the</p>\n<p>court.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.</p>\n<p>“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were</p>\n<p>just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White</p>\n<p>Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he</p>\n<p>said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as</p>\n<p>he spoke.</p>\n<p>“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on</p>\n<p>to himself in an undertone,</p>\n",
        "<p>“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying</p>\n<p>which word sounded best.</p>\n<p>Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”</p>\n<p>Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;</p>\n<p>“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.</p>\n<p>At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in</p>\n<p>his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule</p>\n",
        "<p>Forty-two.</p>\n<p>_All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”</p>\n<p>Everybody looked at Alice.</p>\n<p>“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“You are,” said the King.</p>\n<p>“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.</p>\n<p>“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a</p>\n",
        "<p>regular rule: you invented it just now.”</p>\n<p>“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.</p>\n<p>“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p>\n<p>“Consider your</p>\n<p>verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.</p>\n<p>“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the</p>\n",
        "<p>White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been</p>\n<p>picked up.”</p>\n<p>“What’s in it?” said the Queen.</p>\n<p>“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a</p>\n<p>letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”</p>\n<p>“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to</p>\n<p>nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.</p>\n<p>“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s</p>\n<p>nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,</p>\n<p>and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”</p>\n<p>“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.</p>\n<p>“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest</p>\n<p>thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p>\n",
        "<p>“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King.</p>\n<p>(The jury</p>\n<p>all brightened up again.)</p>\n<p>“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they</p>\n<p>can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”</p>\n<p>“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter</p>\n<p>worse.</p>\n",
        "<p>You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed</p>\n<p>your name like an honest man.”</p>\n<p>There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really</p>\n<p>clever thing the King had said that day.</p>\n<p>“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.</p>\n<p>“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Why, you don’t even know</p>\n",
        "<p>what they’re about!”</p>\n<p>“Read them,” said the King.</p>\n<p>The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.</p>\n<p>“Where shall I begin, please</p>\n<p>your Majesty?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you</p>\n<p>come to the end: then stop.”</p>\n",
        "<p>These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—</p>\n<p>“They told me you had been to her,</p>\n<p>And mentioned me to him:</p>\n<p>She gave me a good character,</p>\n<p>But said I could not swim.</p>\n<p>He sent them word I had not gone</p>\n<p>(We know it to be true):</p>\n",
        "<p>If she should push the matter on,</p>\n<p>What would become of you?</p>\n<p>I gave her one, they gave him two,</p>\n<p>You gave us three or more;</p>\n<p>They all returned from him to you,</p>\n<p>Though they were mine before.</p>\n<p>If I or she should chance to be</p>\n",
        "<p>Involved in this affair,</p>\n<p>He trusts to you to set them free,</p>\n<p>Exactly as we were.</p>\n<p>My notion was that you had been</p>\n<p>(Before she had this fit)</p>\n<p>An obstacle that came between</p>\n<p>Him, and ourselves, and it.</p>\n",
        "<p>Don’t let him know she liked them best,</p>\n<p>For this must ever be</p>\n<p>A secret, kept from all the rest,</p>\n<p>Between yourself and me.”</p>\n<p>“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the</p>\n<p>King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”</p>\n<p>“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so</p>\n",
        "<p>large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of</p>\n<p>interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence.</p>\n<p>_I_ don’t believe there’s</p>\n<p>an atom of meaning in it.”</p>\n<p>The jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s</p>\n<p>an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the</p>\n<p>paper.</p>\n",
        "<p>“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of</p>\n<p>trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any.</p>\n<p>And yet I don’t</p>\n<p>know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at</p>\n<p>them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.</p>\n<p>“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning</p>\n<p>to the Knave.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Knave shook his head sadly.</p>\n<p>“Do I look like it?” he said.</p>\n<p>(Which he</p>\n<p>certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p>\n<p>“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the</p>\n<p>verses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of</p>\n<p>course—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he</p>\n",
        "<p>did with the tarts, you know—”</p>\n<p>“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the</p>\n<p>tarts on the table.</p>\n<p>“Nothing can be clearer than _that_.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I</p>\n",
        "<p>think?” he said to the Queen.</p>\n<p>“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard</p>\n<p>as she spoke.</p>\n<p>(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his</p>\n<p>slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily</p>\n<p>began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long</p>\n<p>as it lasted.)</p>\n",
        "<p>“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the</p>\n<p>court with a smile.</p>\n<p>There was a dead silence.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody</p>\n<p>laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for</p>\n<p>about the twentieth time that day.</p>\n<p>“No, no!” said the Queen.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”</p>\n<p>“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly.</p>\n<p>“The idea of having the</p>\n<p>sentence first!”</p>\n<p>“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.</p>\n<p>“I won’t!” said Alice.</p>\n<p>“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p>\n",
        "<p>Nobody</p>\n<p>moved.</p>\n<p>“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by</p>\n<p>this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”</p>\n<p>At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon</p>\n<p>her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and</p>\n<p>tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her</p>\n",
        "<p>head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead</p>\n<p>leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.</p>\n<p>“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve</p>\n<p>had!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her</p>\n<p>sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p>\n<p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she</p>\n",
        "<p>had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious</p>\n<p>dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”</p>\n<p>So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,</p>\n<p>what a wonderful dream it had been.</p>\n<p>But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her</p>\n<p>hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all</p>\n<p>her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,</p>\n",
        "<p>and this was her dream:—</p>\n<p>First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny</p>\n<p>hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were</p>\n<p>looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and</p>\n<p>see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair</p>\n<p>that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or</p>\n<p>seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the</p>\n",
        "<p>strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.</p>\n<p>The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the</p>\n<p>frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she</p>\n<p>could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends</p>\n<p>shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen</p>\n<p>ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby</p>\n<p>was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed</p>\n",
        "<p>around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the</p>\n<p>Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p>\n<p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock</p>\n<p>Turtle.</p>\n<p>So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p>\n<p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all</p>\n<p>would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the</p>\n",
        "<p>wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling</p>\n<p>teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill</p>\n<p>cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the</p>\n<p>shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change</p>\n<p>(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the</p>\n<p>lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock</p>\n<p>Turtle’s heavy sobs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers</p>\n<p>would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would</p>\n<p>keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her</p>\n<p>childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,</p>\n<p>and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,</p>\n<p>perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she</p>\n<p>would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all</p>\n",
        "<p>their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer</p>\n<p>days.</p>\n<p>THE END</p>\n<p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 11 ***</p>\n"
