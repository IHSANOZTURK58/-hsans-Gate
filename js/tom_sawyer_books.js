        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV. A New Order of Things—Poor Huck—New Adventures Planned (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Contentment</p>\n<p>PREFACE</p>\n<p>Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two</p>\n<p>were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates</p>\n<p>of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an</p>\n<p>individual—he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom</p>\n<p>I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV. A New Order of Things—Poor Huck—New Adventures Planned (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and</p>\n<p>slaves in the West at the period of this story—that is to say, thirty or</p>\n<p>forty years ago.</p>\n<p>Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and</p>\n<p>girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,</p>\n<p>for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what</p>\n<p>they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV. A New Order of Things—Poor Huck—New Adventures Planned (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.</p>\n<p>THE AUTHOR.</p>\n<p>HARTFORD, 1876.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>\n<p>“Tom!”</p>\n<p>No answer.</p>\n<p>“TOM!”</p>\n<p>No answer.</p>\n<p>“What’s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!”</p>\n<p>No answer.</p>\n<p>The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or</p>\n<p>never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were</p>\n<p>her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not</p>\n<p>service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.</p>\n<p>She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but</p>\n<p>still loud enough for the furniture to hear:</p>\n<p>“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll—”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching</p>\n<p>under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the</p>\n<p>punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.</p>\n<p>“I never did see the beat of that boy!”</p>\n<p>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the</p>\n<p>tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So</p>\n<p>she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Y-o-u-u TOM!”</p>\n<p>There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize</p>\n<p>a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.</p>\n<p>“There! I might ’a’ thought of that closet. What you been doing in</p>\n<p>there?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>truck?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, aunt.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I know. It’s jam—that’s what it is. Forty times I’ve said if you</p>\n<p>didn’t let that jam alone I’d skin you. Hand me that switch.”</p>\n<p>The switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—</p>\n<p>“My! Look behind you, aunt!”</p>\n<p>The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and</p>\n<p>disappeared over it.</p>\n<p>His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle</p>\n<p>laugh.</p>\n<p>“Hang the boy, can’t I never learn anything? Ain’t he played me tricks</p>\n<p>enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old</p>\n<p>fools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,</p>\n<p>and how is a body to know what’s coming? He ’pears to know just how long</p>\n<p>he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make</p>\n<p>out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all down again and</p>\n<p>I can’t hit him a lick. I ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s</p>\n<p>the Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as</p>\n<p>the Good Book says. I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>know. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own dead</p>\n<p>sister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him,</p>\n<p>somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and</p>\n<p>every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is</p>\n<p>born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,</p>\n<p>and I reckon it’s so. He’ll play hookey this evening,[*] and I’ll just</p>\n<p>be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty hard</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he</p>\n<p>hates work more than he hates anything else, and I’ve _got_ to do some</p>\n<p>of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination of the child.”</p>\n<p>[*] Southwestern for “afternoon”</p>\n<p>Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home</p>\n<p>barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood</p>\n<p>and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.</p>\n<p>Tom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through</p>\n<p>with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,</p>\n<p>and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.</p>\n<p>While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity</p>\n<p>offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and</p>\n<p>very deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she</p>\n<p>was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she</p>\n<p>loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low</p>\n<p>cunning. Said she:</p>\n<p>“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t it?”</p>\n<p>“Yes’m.”</p>\n<p>“Powerful warm, warn’t it?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Yes’m.”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”</p>\n<p>A bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He</p>\n<p>searched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:</p>\n<p>“No’m—well, not very much.”</p>\n<p>The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:</p>\n<p>“But you ain’t too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing</p>\n<p>that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew</p>\n<p>where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:</p>\n<p>“Some of us pumped on our heads—mine’s damp yet. See?”</p>\n<p>Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of</p>\n<p>circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new</p>\n<p>inspiration:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to</p>\n<p>pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”</p>\n<p>The trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt</p>\n<p>collar was securely sewed.</p>\n<p>“Bother! Well, go ’long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey</p>\n<p>and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a</p>\n<p>singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. _This_ time.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom</p>\n<p>had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.</p>\n<p>But Sidney said:</p>\n<p>“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread,</p>\n<p>but it’s black.”</p>\n<p>“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”</p>\n<p>But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”</p>\n<p>In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into</p>\n<p>the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle</p>\n<p>carried white thread and the other black. He said:</p>\n<p>“She’d never noticed if it hadn’t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes</p>\n<p>she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to</p>\n<p>gee-miny she’d stick to one or t’other—I can’t keep the run of ’em. But</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>I bet you I’ll lam Sid for that. I’ll learn him!”</p>\n<p>He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well</p>\n<p>though—and loathed him.</p>\n<p>Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not</p>\n<p>because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a</p>\n<p>man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore</p>\n<p>them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new</p>\n<p>interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired</p>\n<p>from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It</p>\n<p>consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,</p>\n<p>produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short</p>\n<p>intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to</p>\n<p>do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of</p>\n<p>harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer</p>\n<p>feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep,</p>\n<p>unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the</p>\n<p>astronomer.</p>\n<p>The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom</p>\n<p>checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive</p>\n<p>curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy</p>\n<p>was well dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply</p>\n<p>astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth</p>\n<p>roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes</p>\n<p>on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of</p>\n<p>ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose</p>\n<p>at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to</p>\n<p>him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only</p>\n<p>sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the</p>\n<p>time. Finally Tom said:</p>\n<p>“I can lick you!”</p>\n<p>“I’d like to see you try it.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, I can do it.”</p>\n<p>“No you can’t, either.”</p>\n<p>“Yes I can.”</p>\n<p>“No you can’t.”</p>\n<p>“I can.”</p>\n<p>“You can’t.”</p>\n<p>“Can!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Can’t!”</p>\n<p>An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:</p>\n<p>“What’s your name?”</p>\n<p>“’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.”</p>\n<p>“Well I ’low I’ll _make_ it my business.”</p>\n<p>“Well why don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“If you say much, I will.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Much—much—_much_. There now.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick you with</p>\n<p>one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.”</p>\n<p>“Well why don’t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.”</p>\n<p>“Well I _will_, if you fool with me.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yes—I’ve seen whole families in the same fix.”</p>\n<p>“Smarty! You think you’re _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, what a hat!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“You can lump that hat if you don’t like it. I dare you to knock it</p>\n<p>off—and anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.”</p>\n<p>“You’re a liar!”</p>\n<p>“You’re another.”</p>\n<p>“You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t take it up.”</p>\n<p>“Aw—take a walk!”</p>\n<p>“Say—if you give me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce a rock</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>off’n your head.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, of _course_ you will.”</p>\n<p>“Well I _will_.”</p>\n<p>“Well why don’t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will</p>\n<p>for? Why don’t you _do_ it? It’s because you’re afraid.”</p>\n<p>“I _ain’t_ afraid.”</p>\n<p>“You are.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I ain’t.”</p>\n<p>“You are.”</p>\n<p>Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently</p>\n<p>they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Get away from here!”</p>\n<p>“Go away yourself!”</p>\n<p>“I won’t.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I won’t either.”</p>\n<p>So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both</p>\n<p>shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But</p>\n<p>neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and</p>\n<p>flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:</p>\n<p>“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can</p>\n<p>thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger</p>\n<p>than he is—and what’s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.”</p>\n<p>[Both brothers were imaginary.]</p>\n<p>“That’s a lie.”</p>\n<p>“_Your_ saying so don’t make it so.”</p>\n<p>Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:</p>\n<p>“I dare you to step over that, and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>up. Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal sheep.”</p>\n<p>The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:</p>\n<p>“Now you said you’d do it, now let’s see you do it.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you crowd me now; you better look out.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you _said_ you’d do it—why don’t you do it?”</p>\n<p>“By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.”</p>\n<p>The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys</p>\n<p>were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and</p>\n<p>for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and</p>\n<p>clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves</p>\n<p>with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the</p>\n<p>fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him</p>\n<p>with his fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying—mainly from rage.</p>\n<p>“Holler ’nuff!”—and the pounding went on.</p>\n<p>At last the stranger got out a smothered “’Nuff!” and Tom let him up and</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Now that’ll learn you. Better look out who you’re fooling with next</p>\n<p>time.”</p>\n<p>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and</p>\n<p>threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.”</p>\n<p>To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and</p>\n<p>as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it</p>\n<p>and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like</p>\n<p>an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he</p>\n<p>lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the</p>\n</div>",

At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom</p>\n<p>a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but</p>\n<p>he said he “’lowed” to “lay” for that boy.</p>\n<p>He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in</p>\n<p>at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and</p>\n<p>when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER I (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its</p>\n<p>firmness.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>\n<p>Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and</p>\n<p>fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if</p>\n<p>the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in</p>\n<p>every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom</p>\n<p>and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond</p>\n<p>the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far</p>\n<p>enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a</p>\n<p>long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and</p>\n<p>a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board</p>\n<p>fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a</p>\n<p>burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost</p>\n<p>plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant</p>\n<p>whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at</p>\n<p>the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from</p>\n<p>the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but</p>\n<p>now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at</p>\n<p>the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there</p>\n<p>waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,</p>\n<p>skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an</p>\n<p>hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”</p>\n<p>Jim shook his head and said:</p>\n<p>“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water</p>\n<p>an’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’ Mars Tom gwine</p>\n<p>to ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ’long an’ ’tend to my own</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>business—she ’lowed _she’d_ ’tend to de whitewashin’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks.</p>\n<p>Gimme the bucket—I won’t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won’t ever</p>\n<p>know.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me.</p>\n<p>’Deed she would.”</p>\n<p>“_She_! She never licks anybody—whacks ’em over the head with her</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>thimble—and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but</p>\n<p>talk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a</p>\n<p>marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”</p>\n<p>Jim began to waver.</p>\n<p>“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”</p>\n<p>“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful</p>\n<p>’fraid ole missis—”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”</p>\n<p>Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down</p>\n<p>his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing</p>\n<p>interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he</p>\n<p>was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was</p>\n<p>whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with</p>\n<p>a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>But Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had</p>\n<p>planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys</p>\n<p>would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and</p>\n<p>they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very</p>\n<p>thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and</p>\n<p>examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange</p>\n<p>of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and</p>\n<p>gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless</p>\n<p>moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,</p>\n<p>magnificent inspiration.</p>\n<p>He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in</p>\n<p>sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been</p>\n<p>dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and</p>\n<p>giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned</p>\n<p>ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As</p>\n<p>he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned</p>\n<p>far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp</p>\n<p>and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered</p>\n<p>himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own</p>\n<p>hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:</p>\n<p>“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he</p>\n<p>drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened</p>\n<p>down his sides.</p>\n<p>“Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Chow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles—for it was</p>\n<p>representing a forty-foot wheel.</p>\n<p>“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!”</p>\n<p>The left hand began to describe circles.</p>\n<p>“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on</p>\n<p>the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!</p>\n<p>Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Come—out with your spring-line—what’re you about there! Take a turn</p>\n<p>round that stump with the bight of it!

SH’T!”</p>\n<p>(trying the gauge-cocks).</p>\n<p>Tom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared</p>\n<p>a moment and then said: “_Hi-Yi! You’re_ up a stump, ain’t you!”</p>\n<p>No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as</p>\n<p>before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the</p>\n<p>apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:</p>\n<p>“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”</p>\n<p>Tom wheeled suddenly and said:</p>\n<p>“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”</p>\n<p>“Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>course you’d druther _work_—wouldn’t you? Course you would!”</p>\n<p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:</p>\n<p>“What do you call work?”</p>\n<p>“Why, ain’t _that_ work?”</p>\n<p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:</p>\n<p>“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom</p>\n<p>Sawyer.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you _like_ it?”</p>\n<p>The brush continued to move.</p>\n<p>“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a</p>\n<p>chance to whitewash a fence every day?”</p>\n<p>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.</p>\n<p>Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the</p>\n<p>effect—added a touch here and there—criticised the effect again—Ben</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more</p>\n<p>absorbed. Presently he said:</p>\n<p>“Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.”</p>\n<p>Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:</p>\n<p>“No—no—I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful</p>\n<p>particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it</p>\n<p>was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>particular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon</p>\n<p>there ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it</p>\n<p>the way it’s got to be done.”</p>\n<p>“No—is that so? Oh come, now—lemme just try. Only just a little—I’d let</p>\n<p>_you_, if you was me, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted to do</p>\n<p>it, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence</p>\n<p>and anything was to happen to it—”</p>\n<p>“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I’ll give you</p>\n<p>the core of my apple.”</p>\n<p>“Well, here—No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard—”</p>\n<p>“I’ll give you _all_ of it!”</p>\n<p>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the</p>\n<p>sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,</p>\n<p>dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more</p>\n<p>innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every</p>\n<p>little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time</p>\n<p>Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for</p>\n<p>a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour</p>\n<p>after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a</p>\n<p>poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in</p>\n<p>wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part</p>\n<p>of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool</p>\n<p>cannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a</p>\n<p>glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER II (cont.)</h3>\n<p>six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a</p>\n<p>dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,</p>\n<p>and a dilapidated old window sash.</p>\n<p>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company—and</p>\n<p>the fence had three coats of whitewash on it!

The balmy summer</p>\n<p>air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing</p>\n<p>murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her</p>\n<p>knitting—for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her</p>\n<p>lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had</p>\n</div>",

He</p>\n<p>said: “Mayn’t I go and play now, aunt?”</p>\n<p>“What, a’ready? How much have you done?”</p>\n<p>“It’s all done, aunt.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, don’t lie to me—I can’t bear it.”</p>\n<p>“I ain’t, aunt; it _is_ all done.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for</p>\n<p>herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of</p>\n<p>Tom’s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and</p>\n<p>not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a</p>\n<p>streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Well, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can work when you’re a</p>\n</div>",

Well, go ’long and</p>\n<p>play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”</p>\n<p>She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took</p>\n<p>him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,</p>\n<p>along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat</p>\n<p>took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a</p>\n<p>doughnut.</p>\n<p>Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway</p>\n<p>that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and</p>\n<p>the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a</p>\n<p>hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties</p>\n<p>and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general</p>\n<p>thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at</p>\n<p>peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his</p>\n<p>black thread and getting him into trouble.</p>\n<p>Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the</p>\n<p>back of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach</p>\n<p>of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>village, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict,</p>\n<p>according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these</p>\n<p>armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two</p>\n<p>great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better</p>\n<p>suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence</p>\n<p>and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through</p>\n<p>aides-de-camp. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,</p>\n<p>the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the</p>\n<p>necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and</p>\n<p>marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.</p>\n<p>As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new</p>\n<p>girl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow</p>\n<p>hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered</p>\n</div>",

A</p>\n<p>certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a</p>\n<p>memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;</p>\n<p>he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor</p>\n<p>little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had</p>\n<p>confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest</p>\n<p>boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is</p>\n<p>done.</p>\n<p>He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had</p>\n<p>discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and</p>\n<p>began to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win</p>\n<p>her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;</p>\n<p>but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending</p>\n<p>her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,</p>\n<p>grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a</p>\n<p>moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great</p>\n<p>sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,</p>\n<p>right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she</p>\n<p>disappeared.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and</p>\n<p>then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as</p>\n<p>if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.</p>\n<p>Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his</p>\n<p>nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,</p>\n<p>in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his</p>\n<p>bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a</p>\n<p>minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next</p>\n<p>his heart—or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in</p>\n<p>anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.</p>\n<p>He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, “showing</p>\n<p>off,” as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom</p>\n<p>comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some</p>\n</div>",

Finally he strode</p>\n<p>home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.</p>\n<p>All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “what</p>\n<p>had got into the child.” He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and</p>\n<p>did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his</p>\n<p>aunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:</p>\n<p>“Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes it.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, Sid don’t torment a body the way you do. You’d be always into</p>\n<p>that sugar if I warn’t watching you.”</p>\n<p>Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,</p>\n<p>reached for the sugar-bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was</p>\n<p>wellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and</p>\n<p>broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled</p>\n<p>his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she</p>\n<p>asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be</p>\n<p>nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch it.” He was</p>\n<p>so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old</p>\n<p>lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath</p>\n<p>from over her spectacles. He said to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the</p>\n<p>next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to strike again when Tom cried out:</p>\n<p>“Hold on, now, what ’er you belting _me_ for?—Sid broke it!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when</p>\n<p>she got her tongue again, she only said:</p>\n<p>“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some</p>\n<p>other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”</p>\n<p>Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a</p>\n<p>confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.</p>\n<p>So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.</p>\n<p>Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart</p>\n<p>his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the</p>\n<p>consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice</p>\n<p>of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured</p>\n<p>himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching</p>\n<p>one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and</p>\n<p>die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured</p>\n<p>himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and</p>\n<p>his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how</p>\n<p>her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back</p>\n</div>",

But he would</p>\n<p>lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose</p>\n<p>griefs were at an end.

Then he thought of his flower.</p>\n<p>He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal</p>\n<p>felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she</p>\n<p>cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?</p>\n<p>This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he</p>\n<p>worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and</p>\n<p>varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing</p>\n<p>and departed in the darkness.</p>\n<p>About half-past nine or ten o’clock he came along the deserted street to</p>\n<p>where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain</p>\n<p>of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the</p>\n<p>fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under</p>\n<p>that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him</p>\n<p>down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his</p>\n<p>hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.</p>\n<p>And thus he would die—out in the cold world, with no shelter over his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,</p>\n<p>no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And</p>\n<p>thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and</p>\n<p>oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would</p>\n<p>she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,</p>\n<p>so untimely cut down?</p>\n<p>The window went up, a maid-servant’s discordant voice profaned the holy</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains!</p>\n<p>The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz</p>\n<p>as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound</p>\n<p>as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the</p>\n<p>fence and shot away in the gloom.</p>\n<p>Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his</p>\n<p>drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER III (cont.)</h3>\n<p>had any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,” he thought</p>\n<p>better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom’s eye.</p>\n<p>Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental</p>\n<p>note of the omission.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>\n<p>The sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful</p>\n<p>village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family</p>\n<p>worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid</p>\n<p>courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of</p>\n<p>originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of</p>\n<p>the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.</p>\n<p>Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>his verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his</p>\n<p>energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the</p>\n<p>Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.</p>\n<p>At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,</p>\n<p>but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human</p>\n<p>thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took</p>\n<p>his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>fog:</p>\n<p>“Blessed are the—a—a—”</p>\n<p>“Poor”—</p>\n<p>“Yes—poor; blessed are the poor—a—a—”</p>\n<p>“In spirit—”</p>\n<p>“In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they—they—”</p>\n<p>“_Theirs_—”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“For _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom</p>\n<p>of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they—they—”</p>\n<p>“Sh—”</p>\n<p>“For they—a—”</p>\n<p>“S, H, A—”</p>\n<p>“For they S, H—Oh, I don’t know what it is!”</p>\n<p>“_Shall_!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, _shall_! for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall</p>\n<p>mourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that</p>\n<p>shall mourn, for they shall—a—shall _what_? Why don’t you tell me,</p>\n<p>Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t</p>\n<p>do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom,</p>\n<p>you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>There, now, that’s a good boy.”</p>\n<p>“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”</p>\n<p>“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”</p>\n<p>“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”</p>\n<p>And he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity</p>\n<p>and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a</p>\n<p>shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system</p>\n<p>shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,</p>\n<p>but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur</p>\n<p>in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a</p>\n<p>weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing</p>\n<p>mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the</p>\n<p>cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>called off to dress for Sunday-school.</p>\n<p>Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went</p>\n<p>outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he</p>\n<p>dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;</p>\n<p>poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen</p>\n<p>and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But</p>\n<p>Mary removed the towel and said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he</p>\n<p>stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath</p>\n<p>and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut</p>\n<p>and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of</p>\n<p>suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped</p>\n<p>short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line</p>\n<p>there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in</p>\n<p>front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she</p>\n<p>was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of</p>\n<p>color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls</p>\n<p>wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his</p>\n<p>hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his</p>\n<p>own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his</p>\n<p>clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were</p>\n<p>simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his</p>\n<p>wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself;</p>\n<p>she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with</p>\n<p>his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and</p>\n<p>uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there</p>\n<p>was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He</p>\n<p>hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she</p>\n<p>coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought</p>\n<p>them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:</p>\n<p>“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”</p>\n<p>So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three</p>\n<p>children set out for Sunday-school—a place that Tom hated with his whole</p>\n<p>heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.</p>\n<p>Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church</p>\n<p>service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s</p>\n<p>high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;</p>\n<p>the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board</p>\n<p>tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step</p>\n<p>and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:</p>\n<p>“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“What’ll you take for her?”</p>\n<p>“What’ll you give?”</p>\n<p>“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”</p>\n<p>“Less see ’em.”</p>\n<p>Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.</p>\n<p>Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some</p>\n<p>small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten</p>\n<p>or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm</p>\n<p>of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started</p>\n<p>a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,</p>\n<p>elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a</p>\n<p>boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy</p>\n<p>turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole</p>\n<p>class were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came</p>\n<p>to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but</p>\n<p>had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each</p>\n<p>got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture</p>\n<p>on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten</p>\n<p>blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent</p>\n<p>gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy</p>\n<p>times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and</p>\n<p>application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Doré Bible? And</p>\n<p>yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of</p>\n<p>two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once</p>\n<p>recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot</p>\n<p>from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great</p>\n<p>occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)</p>\n<p>had always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older</p>\n<p>pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work</p>\n<p>long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes</p>\n<p>was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s</p>\n<p>heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple</p>\n<p>of weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really</p>\n<p>hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being</p>\n<p>had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.</p>\n<p>In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with</p>\n<p>a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent</p>\n<p>makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as</p>\n<p>necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer</p>\n<p>who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though</p>\n<p>why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music</p>\n<p>is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim</p>\n<p>creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears</p>\n<p>and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a</p>\n<p>fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the</p>\n<p>whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a</p>\n<p>spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had</p>\n<p>fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion</p>\n<p>of the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a</p>\n<p>wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very</p>\n<p>sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places</p>\n<p>in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that</p>\n<p>unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar</p>\n<p>intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this</p>\n<p>fashion:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as</p>\n<p>you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that</p>\n<p>is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one</p>\n<p>little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I</p>\n<p>am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech</p>\n<p>to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it</p>\n<p>makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>place like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so</p>\n<p>on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a</p>\n<p>pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.</p>\n<p>The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights</p>\n<p>and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings</p>\n<p>and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of</p>\n<p>isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the</p>\n<p>conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.</p>\n<p>A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was</p>\n<p>more or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied</p>\n<p>by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman</p>\n<p>with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s</p>\n<p>wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy</p>\n<p>Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this</p>\n<p>small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next</p>\n<p>moment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling</p>\n<p>hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to</p>\n<p>fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one</p>\n<p>alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that</p>\n<p>were sweeping over it now.</p>\n<p>The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.</p>\n<p>Walters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The</p>\n<p>middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one</p>\n<p>than the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children</p>\n<p>had ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>of—and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,</p>\n<p>too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled,</p>\n<p>and seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county</p>\n<p>court-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these</p>\n<p>reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the</p>\n<p>ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of</p>\n<p>their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music</p>\n<p>to his soul to hear the whisperings:</p>\n<p>“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say—look! he’s a going to</p>\n<p>shake hands with him—he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you</p>\n<p>wish you was Jeff?”</p>\n<p>Mr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings</p>\n<p>and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The</p>\n<p>librarian “showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of</p>\n<p>books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority</p>\n<p>delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over</p>\n<p>pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers</p>\n<p>at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen</p>\n<p>teachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>authority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers, of</p>\n<p>both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was</p>\n<p>business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times</p>\n<p>(with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various</p>\n<p>ways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air</p>\n<p>was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it</p>\n<p>all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was</p>\n<p>“showing off,” too.</p>\n<p>There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete,</p>\n<p>and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.</p>\n<p>Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been</p>\n<p>around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,</p>\n<p>to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with</p>\n<p>nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded</p>\n<p>a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not</p>\n<p>expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But</p>\n<p>there was no getting around it—here were the certified checks, and they</p>\n<p>were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with</p>\n<p>the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and</p>\n<p>so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the</p>\n<p>judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon</p>\n<p>in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that</p>\n<p>suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they</p>\n<p>themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to</p>\n<p>Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a</p>\n<p>guileful snake in the grass.</p>\n<p>The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the</p>\n<p>superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked</p>\n<p>somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him</p>\n<p>that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,</p>\n<p>perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would</p>\n<p>strain his capacity, without a doubt.</p>\n<p>Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in</p>\n<p>her face—but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain</p>\n<p>troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went—came again; she watched;</p>\n<p>a furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was</p>\n<p>jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>of all (she thought).</p>\n<p>Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath</p>\n<p>would hardly come, his heart quaked—partly because of the awful</p>\n<p>greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would</p>\n<p>have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The</p>\n<p>Judge put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine little man, and</p>\n<p>asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no, not Tom—it is—”</p>\n<p>“Thomas.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, that’s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That’s very well.</p>\n<p>But you’ve another one I daresay, and you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?”</p>\n<p>“Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say</p>\n<p>sir. You mustn’t forget your manners.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Thomas Sawyer—sir.”</p>\n<p>“That’s it! That’s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two</p>\n<p>thousand verses is a great many—very, very great many. And you never can</p>\n<p>be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth</p>\n<p>more than anything there is in the world; it’s what makes great men</p>\n<p>and good men; you’ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some</p>\n<p>day, Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s all owing to the</p>\n</div>",

That is what you will</p>\n<p>say, Thomas—and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand</p>\n<p>verses—no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>this lady some of the things you’ve learned—no, I know you wouldn’t—for</p>\n<p>we are proud of little boys that learn.

Won’t you tell us the names of the first</p>\n<p>two that were appointed?”</p>\n<p>Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,</p>\n<p>now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said</p>\n<p>to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>question—why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up</p>\n<p>and say:</p>\n<p>“Answer the gentleman, Thomas—don’t be afraid.”</p>\n<p>Tom still hung fire.</p>\n<p>“Now I know you’ll tell me,” said the lady. “The names of the first two</p>\n<p>disciples were—”</p>\n<p>“_David and Goliah!_”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>\n<p>About half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,</p>\n<p>and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The</p>\n<p>Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and</p>\n<p>occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt</p>\n<p>Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her—Tom being placed next</p>\n<p>the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window</p>\n<p>and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible.

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;</p>\n<p>the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other</p>\n<p>unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglas, fair,</p>\n<p>smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill</p>\n<p>mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much</p>\n<p>the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could</p>\n<p>boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by</p>\n<p>a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all</p>\n<p>the young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule</p>\n<p>sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering</p>\n<p>admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came</p>\n<p>the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as</p>\n<p>if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so</p>\n<p>good. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His</p>\n<p>white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on</p>\n<p>Sundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys</p>\n<p>who had as snobs.</p>\n<p>The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,</p>\n<p>to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the</p>\n<p>choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all</p>\n<p>through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,</p>\n<p>but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,</p>\n<p>and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in</p>\n<p>some foreign country.</p>\n<p>The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His</p>\n<p>voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a</p>\n<p>certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word</p>\n<p>and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:</p>\n<p>Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry _beds_</p>\n<p>of ease,</p>\n<p>Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ _blood_</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>-y seas?</p>\n<p>He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was</p>\n<p>always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies</p>\n<p>would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,</p>\n<p>and “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words</p>\n<p>cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal</p>\n<p>earth.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into</p>\n<p>a bulletin-board, and read off “notices” of meetings and societies and</p>\n<p>things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of</p>\n<p>doom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,</p>\n<p>away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is</p>\n<p>to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the</p>\n<p>church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;</p>\n<p>for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United</p>\n<p>States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the</p>\n<p>President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed</p>\n<p>by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of</p>\n<p>European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear</p>\n<p>withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with</p>\n<p>a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace</p>\n<p>and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a</p>\n<p>grateful harvest of good. Amen.</p>\n<p>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.</p>\n<p>The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;</p>\n<p>he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not</p>\n<p>listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular</p>\n<p>route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,</p>\n<p>his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered</p>\n<p>additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had</p>\n<p>lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and</p>\n<p>polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with</p>\n<p>the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping</p>\n<p>its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they</p>\n<p>had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if</p>\n<p>it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s</p>\n<p>hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going</p>\n<p>on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal</p>\n<p>forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of</p>\n<p>war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.</p>\n<p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an</p>\n<p>argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and</p>\n<p>yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly</p>\n<p>worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he</p>\n<p>always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything</p>\n<p>else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested</p>\n<p>for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the</p>\n<p>assembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion</p>\n<p>and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle</p>\n<p>were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the</p>\n<p>principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the</p>\n<p>thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,</p>\n<p>if it was a tame lion.</p>\n<p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.</p>\n<p>Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It</p>\n<p>was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to</p>\n<p>take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went</p>\n<p>floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went</p>\n<p>into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,</p>\n<p>unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out</p>\n<p>of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came</p>\n<p>idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the</p>\n<p>quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the</p>\n<p>drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around</p>\n<p>it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew</p>\n<p>bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly</p>\n<p>snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,</p>\n<p>and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent</p>\n<p>and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin</p>\n<p>descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,</p>\n<p>a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards</p>\n<p>away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators</p>\n<p>shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER V (cont.)</h3>\n<p>hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,</p>\n<p>and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a</p>\n<p>craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on</p>\n<p>it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his</p>\n<p>fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at</p>\n<p>it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again.

It was a genuine relief to the whole</p>\n<p>congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.</p>\n<p>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was</p>\n<p>some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety</p>\n</div>",

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>\n<p>Monday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found</p>\n<p>him so—because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He</p>\n<p>generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,</p>\n<p>it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.</p>\n<p>Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was</p>\n<p>sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.</p>\n<p>He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated</p>\n</div>",

This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he</p>\n<p>began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew</p>\n<p>feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly</p>\n<p>he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This</p>\n<p>was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he</p>\n<p>called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that</p>\n<p>argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.</p>\n<p>Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing</p>\n<p>the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or</p>\n<p>three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly</p>\n<p>drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.</p>\n<p>But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed</p>\n<p>well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable</p>\n</div>",

He took a rest and then</p>\n<p>swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.</p>\n<p>Sid snored on.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom was aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” and shook him. This course</p>\n<p>worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then</p>\n<p>brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.</p>\n<p>Tom went on groaning. Sid said:</p>\n<p>“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,</p>\n<p>Tom?” And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.</p>\n<p>Tom moaned out:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, don’t, Sid. Don’t joggle me.”</p>\n<p>“Why, what’s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.”</p>\n<p>“No—never mind. It’ll be over by and by, maybe. Don’t call anybody.”</p>\n<p>“But I must! _Don’t_ groan so, Tom, it’s awful. How long you been this</p>\n<p>way?”</p>\n<p>“Hours. Ouch! Oh, don’t stir so, Sid, you’ll kill me.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, why didn’t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don’t!_ It makes my flesh</p>\n</div>",

[Groan.] Tell ’em so, Sid. And Sid, you give</p>\n<p>my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that’s come to</p>\n<p>town, and tell her—”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,</p>\n<p>now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had</p>\n<p>gathered quite a genuine tone.</p>\n<p>Sid flew downstairs and said:</p>\n<p>“Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom’s dying!”</p>\n<p>“Dying!”</p>\n<p>“Yes’m. Don’t wait—come quick!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Rubbage! I don’t believe it!”</p>\n<p>But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.</p>\n<p>And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the</p>\n<p>bedside she gasped out:</p>\n<p>“You, Tom! Tom, what’s the matter with you?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, auntie, I’m—”</p>\n<p>“What’s the matter with you—what is the matter with you, child?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!”</p>\n<p>The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a</p>\n<p>little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:</p>\n<p>“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and</p>\n<p>climb out of this.”</p>\n<p>The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a</p>\n<p>little foolish, and he said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my</p>\n<p>tooth at all.”</p>\n<p>“Your tooth, indeed!

Open your mouth.</p>\n<p>Well—your tooth _is_ loose, but you’re not going to die about that.</p>\n<p>Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Oh, please, auntie, don’t pull it out. It don’t hurt any more.

So all this row was because you thought you’d</p>\n<p>get to stay home from school and go a-fishing?

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>outrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old</p>\n<p>lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom’s tooth with a loop</p>\n<p>and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and</p>\n<p>suddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s face. The tooth hung dangling</p>\n<p>by the bedpost, now.</p>\n<p>But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after</p>\n<p>breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable</p>\n<p>way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;</p>\n<p>and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and</p>\n<p>homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,</p>\n<p>and shorn of his glory.

His hat</p>\n<p>was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,</p>\n<p>when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons</p>\n<p>far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of</p>\n</div>",

In a word, everything</p>\n<p>that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,</p>\n<p>hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.</p>\n<p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p>\n<p>“Hello, Huckleberry!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Hello yourself, and see how you like it.”</p>\n<p>“What’s that you got?”</p>\n<p>“Dead cat.”</p>\n<p>“Lemme see him, Huck.

Where’d you get him?”</p>\n<p>“Bought him off’n a boy.”</p>\n<p>“What did you give?”</p>\n<p>“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”</p>\n</div>",

Cure warts with.”</p>\n<p>“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”</p>\n<p>“I bet you don’t. What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Why, spunk-water.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”</p>\n<p>“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you?

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“With his face to the stump?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.

Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all</p>\n<p>by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a</p>\n</div>",

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner</p>\n<p>done.”</p>\n<p>“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this</p>\n<p>town; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work</p>\n<p>spunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,</p>\n<p>Huck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many</p>\n<p>warts.

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”</p>\n<p>“Have you?

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the</p>\n<p>wart, and pretty soon off she comes.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that’s it, Huck—that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you</p>\n<p>say ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better.</p>\n<p>That’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and</p>\n<p>most everywheres.

Huckleberry viewed</p>\n<p>it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Is it genuwyne?”</p>\n<p>Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.</p>\n<p>“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”</p>\n<p>Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the</p>\n<p>pinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than</p>\n<p>before.</p>\n<p>When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He</p>\n<p>hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like</p>\n<p>alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom</p>\n<p>arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The</p>\n<p>interruption roused him.</p>\n<p>“Thomas Sawyer!”</p>\n<p>Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Sir!”</p>\n<p>“Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?”</p>\n<p>Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of</p>\n<p>yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric</p>\n<p>sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the</p>\n<p>girls’ side of the school-house. He instantly said:</p>\n<p>“_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The master’s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of</p>\n<p>study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his</p>\n<p>mind. The master said:</p>\n<p>“You—you did what?”</p>\n<p>“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”</p>\n<p>There was no mistaking the words.</p>\n<p>“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your</p>\n<p>jacket.”</p>\n<p>The master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches</p>\n<p>notably diminished. Then the order followed:</p>\n<p>“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”</p>\n<p>The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but</p>\n<p>in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good</p>\n<p>fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched</p>\n<p>herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and</p>\n<p>whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the</p>\n<p>long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.</p>\n<p>By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur</p>\n<p>rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him</p>\n<p>and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she</p>\n<p>cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it</p>\n<p>away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less</p>\n<p>animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it</p>\n<p>remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The</p>\n<p>girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time</p>\n<p>the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began</p>\n<p>to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,</p>\n<p>apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt</p>\n<p>to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she</p>\n<p>gave in and hesitatingly whispered:</p>\n<p>“Let me see it.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends</p>\n<p>to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s</p>\n<p>interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything</p>\n<p>else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:</p>\n<p>“It’s nice—make a man.”</p>\n<p>The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He</p>\n<p>could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:</p>\n<p>“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”</p>\n<p>Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed</p>\n<p>the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:</p>\n<p>“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, will you? When?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”</p>\n<p>“I’ll stay if you will.”</p>\n<p>“Good—that’s a whack. What’s your name?”</p>\n<p>“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”</p>\n<p>“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me</p>\n<p>Tom, will you?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from</p>\n<p>the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Oh, it ain’t anything.”</p>\n<p>“Yes it is.”</p>\n<p>“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”</p>\n<p>“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“You’ll tell.”</p>\n<p>“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”</p>\n<p>“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”</p>\n<p>“No, I won’t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, _you_ don’t want to see!”</p>\n<p>“Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.” And she put her small hand</p>\n<p>upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were</p>\n<p>revealed: “_I love you_.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and</p>\n<p>looked pleased, nevertheless.</p>\n<p>Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his</p>\n<p>ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the</p>\n<p>house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful</p>\n<p>moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But</p>\n<p>although Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.</p>\n<p>As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but</p>\n<p>the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the</p>\n<p>reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and</p>\n<p>turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and</p>\n<p>got “turned down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought</p>\n<p>up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with</p>\n<p>ostentation for months.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>\n<p>The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas</p>\n<p>wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed</p>\n<p>to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.</p>\n<p>There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.</p>\n<p>The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed</p>\n<p>the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the</p>\n<p>flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds</p>\n<p>floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible</p>\n<p>but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or</p>\n<p>else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.</p>\n<p>His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of</p>\n<p>gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively</p>\n<p>the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that</p>\n<p>amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when</p>\n<p>he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and</p>\n<p>made him take a new direction.</p>\n<p>Tom’s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and</p>\n<p>now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in</p>\n<p>an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a</p>\n<p>pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.</p>\n<p>The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were</p>\n<p>interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit</p>\n<p>of the tick. So he put Joe’s slate on the desk and drew a line down the</p>\n<p>middle of it from top to bottom.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said he, “as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>I’ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,</p>\n<p>you’re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.”</p>\n<p>“All right, go ahead; start him up.”</p>\n<p>The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe</p>\n<p>harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This</p>\n<p>change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with</p>\n<p>absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all</p>\n<p>things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The</p>\n<p>tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as</p>\n<p>anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would</p>\n<p>have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would</p>\n<p>be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep</p>\n<p>possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in</p>\n<p>a moment. Said he:</p>\n<p>“Tom, you let him alone.”</p>\n<p>“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”</p>\n<p>“No, sir, it ain’t fair; you just let him alone.”</p>\n<p>“Blame it, I ain’t going to stir him much.”</p>\n<p>“Let him alone, I tell you.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I won’t!”</p>\n<p>“You shall—he’s on my side of the line.”</p>\n<p>“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care whose tick he is—he’s on my side of the line, and you</p>\n<p>sha’n’t touch him.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ll just bet I will, though. He’s my tick and I’ll do what I</p>\n<p>blame please with him, or die!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>A tremendous whack came down on Tom’s shoulders, and its duplicate on</p>\n<p>Joe’s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from</p>\n<p>the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been</p>\n<p>too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile</p>\n<p>before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.</p>\n<p>He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed</p>\n<p>his bit of variety to it.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered</p>\n<p>in her ear:</p>\n<p>“Put on your bonnet and let on you’re going home; and when you get to</p>\n<p>the corner, give the rest of ’em the slip, and turn down through the</p>\n<p>lane and come back. I’ll go the other way and come it over ’em the same</p>\n<p>way.”</p>\n<p>So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and</p>\n<p>when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they</p>\n<p>sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil</p>\n<p>and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising</p>\n<p>house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.</p>\n<p>Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:</p>\n<p>“Do you love rats?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“No! I hate them!”</p>\n<p>“Well, I do, too—_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your</p>\n<p>head with a string.”</p>\n<p>“No, I don’t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”</p>\n<p>“Do you? I’ve got some. I’ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give</p>\n<p>it back to me.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs</p>\n<p>against the bench in excess of contentment.</p>\n<p>“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.</p>\n<p>“Yes, and my pa’s going to take me again some time, if I’m good.”</p>\n<p>“I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. Church ain’t</p>\n<p>shucks to a circus. There’s things going on at a circus all the time.</p>\n<p>I’m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, are you! That will be nice. They’re so lovely, all spotted up.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that’s so. And they get slathers of money—most a dollar a day, Ben</p>\n<p>Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”</p>\n<p>“What’s that?”</p>\n<p>“Why, engaged to be married.”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Would you like to?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I reckon so. I don’t know. What is it like?”</p>\n<p>“Like? Why it ain’t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won’t</p>\n<p>ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that’s</p>\n<p>all. Anybody can do it.”</p>\n<p>“Kiss? What do you kiss for?”</p>\n<p>“Why, that, you know, is to—well, they always do that.”</p>\n<p>“Everybody?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Why, yes, everybody that’s in love with each other. Do you remember</p>\n<p>what I wrote on the slate?”</p>\n<p>“Ye—yes.”</p>\n<p>“What was it?”</p>\n<p>“I sha’n’t tell you.”</p>\n<p>“Shall I tell _you_?”</p>\n<p>“Ye—yes—but some other time.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“No, now.”</p>\n<p>“No, not now—to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky—I’ll whisper it, I’ll whisper it ever so</p>\n<p>easy.”</p>\n<p>Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about</p>\n<p>her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to</p>\n<p>her ear. And then he added:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Now you whisper it to me—just the same.”</p>\n<p>She resisted, for a while, and then said:</p>\n<p>“You turn your face away so you can’t see, and then I will. But you</p>\n<p>mustn’t ever tell anybody—_will_ you, Tom? Now you won’t, _will_ you?”</p>\n<p>“No, indeed, indeed I won’t. Now, Becky.”</p>\n<p>He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred</p>\n<p>his curls and whispered, “I—love—you!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,</p>\n<p>with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little</p>\n<p>white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:</p>\n<p>“Now, Becky, it’s all done—all over but the kiss. Don’t you be afraid</p>\n<p>of that—it ain’t anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her</p>\n<p>apron and the hands.</p>\n<p>By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Now it’s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain’t</p>\n<p>ever to love anybody but me, and you ain’t ever to marry anybody but me,</p>\n<p>ever never and forever. Will you?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I’ll never marry anybody</p>\n<p>but you—and you ain’t to ever marry anybody but me, either.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Certainly. Of course. That’s _part_ of it. And always coming to school</p>\n<p>or when we’re going home, you’re to walk with me, when there ain’t</p>\n<p>anybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because</p>\n<p>that’s the way you do when you’re engaged.”</p>\n<p>“It’s so nice. I never heard of it before.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, it’s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence—”</p>\n<p>The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, Tom! Then I ain’t the first you’ve ever been engaged to!”</p>\n<p>The child began to cry. Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t cry, Becky, I don’t care for her any more.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you do, Tom—you know you do.”</p>\n<p>Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and</p>\n<p>turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with</p>\n<p>soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and</p>\n<p>uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping</p>\n<p>she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began</p>\n<p>to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle</p>\n<p>with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and</p>\n<p>entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with</p>\n<p>her face to the wall. Tom’s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:</p>\n<p>“Becky, I—I don’t care for anybody but you.”</p>\n<p>No reply—but sobs.</p>\n<p>“Becky”—pleadingly. “Becky, won’t you say something?”</p>\n<p>More sobs.</p>\n<p>Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,</p>\n<p>and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Please, Becky, won’t you take it?”</p>\n<p>She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over</p>\n<p>the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently</p>\n<p>Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she</p>\n<p>flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:</p>\n<p>“Tom! Come back, Tom!”</p>\n<p>She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid</p>\n<p>herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she</p>\n<p>had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross</p>\n<p>of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about</p>\n<p>her to exchange sorrows with.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>\n<p>Tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the</p>\n<p>track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed</p>\n<p>a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile</p>\n<p>superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later</p>\n<p>he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff</p>\n<p>Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the</p>\n<p>valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.</p>\n<p>There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even</p>\n<p>stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken</p>\n<p>by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and</p>\n<p>this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the</p>\n<p>more profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings</p>\n<p>were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him</p>\n<p>that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy</p>\n<p>Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie</p>\n<p>and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through</p>\n<p>the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and</p>\n<p>nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a</p>\n<p>clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant</p>\n<p>the best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. She</p>\n<p>would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only</p>\n<p>die _temporarily_!</p>\n<p>But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained</p>\n<p>shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into</p>\n<p>the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away—ever so far away, into</p>\n<p>unknown countries beyond the seas—and never came back any more! How</p>\n<p>would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only</p>\n<p>to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights</p>\n<p>were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was</p>\n<p>exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be</p>\n<p>a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>No—better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on</p>\n<p>the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the</p>\n<p>Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with</p>\n<p>feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy</p>\n<p>summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs</p>\n<p>of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was</p>\n<p>something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable</p>\n<p>splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!</p>\n<p>How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,</p>\n<p>black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying</p>\n<p>at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear</p>\n<p>at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in</p>\n<p>his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass</p>\n<p>at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,</p>\n<p>with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy</p>\n<p>the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the</p>\n<p>Spanish Main!”</p>\n<p>Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from</p>\n<p>home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.</p>\n<p>He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of</p>\n<p>it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He</p>\n<p>put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:</p>\n<p>“What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!”</p>\n<p>Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it</p>\n<p>up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was boundless!</p>\n<p>He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:</p>\n<p>“Well, that beats anything!”</p>\n<p>Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The</p>\n<p>truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and</p>\n<p>all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried</p>\n<p>a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just</p>\n<p>used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered</p>\n<p>themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been</p>\n<p>separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.</p>\n<p>Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had</p>\n<p>many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing</p>\n<p>before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He</p>\n<p>puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch</p>\n<p>had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself</p>\n<p>on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot</p>\n<p>with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and</p>\n<p>put his mouth close to this depression and called—</p>\n<p>“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”</p>\n<p>The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a</p>\n<p>second and then darted under again in a fright.</p>\n<p>“He dasn’t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”</p>\n<p>He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he</p>\n<p>gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have</p>\n<p>the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his</p>\n<p>treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing</p>\n<p>when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his</p>\n<p>pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:</p>\n<p>“Brother, go find your brother!”</p>\n<p>He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must</p>\n<p>have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each</p>\n<p>other.</p>\n<p>Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green</p>\n<p>aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned</p>\n<p>a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,</p>\n<p>disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and</p>\n<p>in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an</p>\n<p>answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way</p>\n<p>and that. He said cautiously—to an imaginary company:</p>\n<p>“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”</p>\n<p>Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.</p>\n<p>Tom called:</p>\n<p>“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—”</p>\n<p>“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by</p>\n<p>the book,” from memory.</p>\n<p>“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”</p>\n<p>“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”</p>\n<p>“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute</p>\n<p>with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,</p>\n<p>struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful</p>\n<p>combat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”</p>\n<p>So they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and</p>\n<p>by Tom shouted:</p>\n<p>“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the</p>\n<p>book. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy</p>\n<p>of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”</p>\n<p>There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the</p>\n<p>whack and fell.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill _you_. That’s</p>\n<p>fair.”</p>\n<p>“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”</p>\n<p>“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam</p>\n<p>me with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be</p>\n<p>Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then</p>\n<p>Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to</p>\n<p>bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,</p>\n<p>representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,</p>\n<p>gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow</p>\n<p>falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he</p>\n<p>shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.</p>\n<p>The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off</p>\n<p>grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern</p>\n<p>civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.</p>\n<p>They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than</p>\n<p>President of the United States forever.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>\n<p>At half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.</p>\n<p>They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and</p>\n<p>waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be</p>\n<p>nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He</p>\n<p>would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was</p>\n<p>afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.</p>\n<p>Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking</p>\n<p>of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack</p>\n<p>mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.</p>\n<p>A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the</p>\n<p>tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,</p>\n<p>began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the</p>\n<p>bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered</p>\n<p>by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last</p>\n<p>he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to</p>\n<p>doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear</p>\n<p>it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most</p>\n<p>melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed</p>\n<p>him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a</p>\n<p>single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping</p>\n<p>along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once</p>\n<p>or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence</p>\n<p>to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys</p>\n<p>moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they</p>\n<p>were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,</p>\n<p>about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence</p>\n<p>around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the</p>\n<p>time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the</p>\n<p>whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a</p>\n<p>tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over</p>\n<p>the graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>of” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have</p>\n<p>been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.</p>\n<p>A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the</p>\n<p>spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked</p>\n<p>little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the</p>\n<p>pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the</p>\n<p>sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of</p>\n<p>the grave.</p>\n<p>Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of</p>\n<p>a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom’s</p>\n<p>reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a</p>\n<p>whisper:</p>\n<p>“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Huckleberry whispered:</p>\n<p>“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn like, _ain’t_ it?”</p>\n<p>“I bet it is.”</p>\n<p>There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter</p>\n<p>inwardly. Then Tom whispered:</p>\n<p>“Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”</p>\n<p>“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom, after a pause:</p>\n<p>“I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody</p>\n<p>calls him Hoss.”</p>\n<p>“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ’bout these-yer dead</p>\n<p>people, Tom.”</p>\n<p>This was a damper, and conversation died again.</p>\n<p>Presently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Sh!”</p>\n<p>“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts.</p>\n<p>“Sh! There ’tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”</p>\n<p>“I—”</p>\n<p>“There! Now you hear it.”</p>\n<p>“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”</p>\n<p>“I dono. Think they’ll see us?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn’t</p>\n<p>come.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing</p>\n<p>any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at</p>\n<p>all.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”</p>\n<p>“Listen!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled</p>\n<p>sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.</p>\n<p>“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”</p>\n<p>“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”</p>\n<p>Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an</p>\n<p>old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable</p>\n<p>little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>shudder:</p>\n<p>“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ’em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners!</p>\n<p>Can you pray?”</p>\n<p>“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I</p>\n<p>lay me down to sleep, I—’”</p>\n<p>“Sh!”</p>\n<p>“What is it, Huck?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“They’re _humans_! One of ’em is, anyway. One of ’em’s old Muff Potter’s</p>\n<p>voice.”</p>\n<p>“No—’tain’t so, is it?”</p>\n<p>“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to</p>\n<p>notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”</p>\n<p>“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they</p>\n<p>come again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>p’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s</p>\n<p>Injun Joe.”</p>\n<p>“That’s so—that murderin’ half-breed! I’d druther they was devils a dern</p>\n<p>sight. What kin they be up to?”</p>\n<p>The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the</p>\n<p>grave and stood within a few feet of the boys’ hiding-place.</p>\n<p>“Here it is,” said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.</p>\n<p>Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple</p>\n<p>of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.</p>\n<p>The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat</p>\n<p>down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the</p>\n<p>boys could have touched him.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, men!” he said, in a low voice; “the moon might come out at any</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>moment.”</p>\n<p>They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no</p>\n<p>noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of</p>\n<p>mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon</p>\n<p>the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two</p>\n<p>the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with</p>\n<p>their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.</p>\n<p>The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a</p>\n<p>blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large</p>\n<p>spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:</p>\n<p>“Now the cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, and you’ll just out with</p>\n<p>another five, or here she stays.”</p>\n<p>“That’s the talk!” said Injun Joe.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Look here, what does this mean?” said the doctor. “You required your</p>\n<p>pay in advance, and I’ve paid you.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and you done more than that,” said Injun Joe, approaching the</p>\n<p>doctor, who was now standing. “Five years ago you drove me away from</p>\n<p>your father’s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to</p>\n<p>eat, and you said I warn’t there for any good; and when I swore I’d get</p>\n<p>even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a vagrant. Did you think I’d forget? The Injun blood ain’t in me for</p>\n<p>nothing. And now I’ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!”</p>\n<p>He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.</p>\n<p>The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.</p>\n<p>Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:</p>\n<p>“Here, now, don’t you hit my pard!” and the next moment he had grappled</p>\n<p>with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe</p>\n<p>sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter’s</p>\n<p>knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about</p>\n<p>the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung</p>\n<p>himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams’ grave and felled</p>\n<p>Potter to the earth with it—and in the same instant the half-breed saw</p>\n<p>his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man’s breast. He</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in</p>\n<p>the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the</p>\n<p>two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.</p>\n<p>Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the</p>\n<p>two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave</p>\n<p>a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:</p>\n<p>“_That_ score is settled—damn you.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter’s</p>\n<p>open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three—four—five</p>\n<p>minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed</p>\n<p>upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a</p>\n<p>shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and</p>\n<p>then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s.</p>\n<p>“Lord, how is this, Joe?” he said.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“It’s a dirty business,” said Joe, without moving. “What did you do it</p>\n<p>for?”</p>\n<p>“I! I never done it!”</p>\n<p>“Look here! That kind of talk won’t wash.”</p>\n<p>Potter trembled and grew white.</p>\n<p>“I thought I’d got sober. I’d no business to drink to-night. But it’s</p>\n<p>in my head yet—worse’n when we started here. I’m all in a muddle;</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>can’t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—_honest_, now,</p>\n<p>old feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor, I</p>\n<p>never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful—and him so</p>\n<p>young and promising.”</p>\n<p>“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard</p>\n<p>and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering</p>\n<p>like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>you another awful clip—and here you’ve laid, as dead as a wedge til</p>\n<p>now.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I didn’t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I</p>\n<p>did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.</p>\n<p>I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never</p>\n<p>with weepons. They’ll all say that. Joe, don’t tell! Say you won’t tell,</p>\n<p>Joe—that’s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>too. Don’t you remember? You _won’t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?” And the</p>\n<p>poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and</p>\n<p>clasped his appealing hands.</p>\n<p>“No, you’ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I</p>\n<p>won’t go back on you. There, now, that’s as fair as a man can say.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Joe, you’re an angel. I’ll bless you for this the longest day I</p>\n<p>live.” And Potter began to cry.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Come, now, that’s enough of that. This ain’t any time for blubbering.</p>\n<p>You be off yonder way and I’ll go this. Move, now, and don’t leave any</p>\n<p>tracks behind you.”</p>\n<p>Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed</p>\n<p>stood looking after him. He muttered:</p>\n<p>“If he’s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he</p>\n<p>had the look of being, he won’t think of the knife till he’s gone so</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>far he’ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by</p>\n<p>himself—chicken-heart!”</p>\n<p>Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the</p>\n<p>lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the</p>\n<p>moon’s. The stillness was complete again, too.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>\n<p>The two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with</p>\n<p>horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,</p>\n<p>apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump</p>\n<p>that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them</p>\n<p>catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay</p>\n<p>near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give</p>\n<p>wings to their feet.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!” whispered</p>\n<p>Tom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it much longer.”</p>\n<p>Huckleberry’s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed</p>\n<p>their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.</p>\n<p>They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst</p>\n<p>through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering</p>\n<p>shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Huckleberry, what do you reckon’ll come of this?”</p>\n<p>“If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come of it.”</p>\n<p>“Do you though?”</p>\n<p>“Why, I _know_ it, Tom.”</p>\n<p>Tom thought a while, then he said:</p>\n<p>“Who’ll tell? We?”</p>\n<p>“What are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>_didn’t_ hang? Why, he’d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure</p>\n<p>as we’re a laying here.”</p>\n<p>“That’s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.”</p>\n<p>“If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he’s fool enough. He’s</p>\n<p>generally drunk enough.”</p>\n<p>Tom said nothing—went on thinking. Presently he whispered:</p>\n<p>“Huck, Muff Potter don’t know it. How can he tell?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“What’s the reason he don’t know it?”</p>\n<p>“Because he’d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D’you reckon</p>\n<p>he could see anything? D’you reckon he knowed anything?”</p>\n<p>“By hokey, that’s so, Tom!”</p>\n<p>“And besides, look-a-here—maybe that whack done for _him_!”</p>\n<p>“No, ’taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and</p>\n<p>besides, he always has. Well, when pap’s full, you might take and belt</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>him over the head with a church and you couldn’t phase him. He says so,</p>\n<p>his own self. So it’s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man</p>\n<p>was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.”</p>\n<p>After another reflective silence, Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?”</p>\n<p>“Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn’t</p>\n<p>make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>’bout this and they didn’t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take</p>\n<p>and swear to one another—that’s what we got to do—swear to keep mum.”</p>\n<p>“I’m agreed. It’s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear</p>\n<p>that we—”</p>\n<p>“Oh no, that wouldn’t do for this. That’s good enough for little</p>\n<p>rubbishy common things—specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you</p>\n<p>anyway, and blab if they get in a huff—but there orter be writing ’bout</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a big thing like this. And blood.”</p>\n<p>Tom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;</p>\n<p>the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.</p>\n<p>He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a</p>\n<p>little fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on</p>\n<p>his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow</p>\n<p>down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>pressure on the up-strokes.</p>\n<p>“Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and</p>\n<p>They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell</p>\n<p>and Rot.”</p>\n<p>Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and</p>\n<p>the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and</p>\n<p>was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Hold on! Don’t do that. A pin’s brass. It might have verdigrease on</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“What’s verdigrease?”</p>\n<p>“It’s p’ison. That’s what it is. You just swaller some of it once—you’ll</p>\n<p>see.”</p>\n<p>So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked</p>\n<p>the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his</p>\n<p>little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and</p>\n<p>an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the</p>\n<p>wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters</p>\n<p>that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown</p>\n<p>away.</p>\n<p>A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>building, now, but they did not notice it.</p>\n<p>“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does this keep us from _ever_</p>\n<p>telling—_always_?”</p>\n<p>“Of course it does. It don’t make any difference _what_ happens, we got</p>\n<p>to keep mum. We’d drop down dead—don’t _you_ know that?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I reckon that’s so.”</p>\n<p>They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a long, lugubrious howl just outside—within ten feet of them. The boys</p>\n<p>clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.</p>\n<p>“Which of us does he mean?” gasped Huckleberry.</p>\n<p>“I dono—peep through the crack. Quick!”</p>\n<p>“No, _you_, Tom!”</p>\n<p>“I can’t—I can’t _do_ it, Huck!”</p>\n<p>“Please, Tom. There ’tis again!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, lordy, I’m thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know his voice. It’s Bull</p>\n<p>Harbison.” *</p>\n<p>[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of</p>\n<p>him as “Harbison’s Bull,” but a son or a dog of that name was “Bull</p>\n<p>Harbison.”]</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s good—I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I’d a bet</p>\n<p>anything it was a _stray_ dog.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The dog howled again. The boys’ hearts sank once more.</p>\n<p>“Oh, my! that ain’t no Bull Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “_Do_,</p>\n<p>Tom!”</p>\n<p>Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His</p>\n<p>whisper was hardly audible when he said:</p>\n<p>“Oh, Huck, _it’s a stray dog_!”</p>\n<p>“Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Huck, he must mean us both—we’re right together.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Tom, I reckon we’re goners. I reckon there ain’t no mistake ’bout</p>\n<p>where _I’ll_ go to. I been so wicked.”</p>\n<p>“Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a</p>\n<p>feller’s told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I’d a</p>\n<p>tried—but no, I wouldn’t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,</p>\n<p>I lay I’ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>little.</p>\n<p>“_You_ bad!” and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom</p>\n<p>Sawyer, you’re just old pie, ’long-side o’ what I am. Oh, _lordy_,</p>\n<p>lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.”</p>\n<p>Tom choked off and whispered:</p>\n<p>“Look, Hucky, look! He’s got his _back_ to us!”</p>\n<p>Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you</p>\n<p>know. _Now_ who can he mean?”</p>\n<p>The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.</p>\n<p>“Sh! What’s that?” he whispered.</p>\n<p>“Sounds like—like hogs grunting. No—it’s somebody snoring, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“That _is_ it! Where ’bouts is it, Huck?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I bleeve it’s down at ’tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep</p>\n<p>there, sometimes, ’long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts</p>\n<p>things when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming back to</p>\n<p>this town any more.”</p>\n<p>The spirit of adventure rose in the boys’ souls once more.</p>\n<p>“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I lead?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t like to, much. Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the</p>\n<p>boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their</p>\n<p>heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,</p>\n<p>the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the</p>\n<p>snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man</p>\n<p>moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was</p>\n<p>Muff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,</p>\n<p>through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance</p>\n<p>to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night</p>\n<p>air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few</p>\n<p>feet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose</p>\n<p>pointing heavenward.</p>\n<p>“Oh, geeminy, it’s _him_!” exclaimed both boys, in a breath.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Say, Tom—they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller’s</p>\n<p>house, ’bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come</p>\n<p>in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there</p>\n<p>ain’t anybody dead there yet.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I know that. And suppose there ain’t. Didn’t Gracie Miller fall</p>\n<p>in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but she ain’t _dead_. And what’s more, she’s getting better, too.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“All right, you wait and see. She’s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff</p>\n<p>Potter’s a goner. That’s what the niggers say, and they know all about</p>\n<p>these kind of things, Huck.”</p>\n<p>Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window</p>\n<p>the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and</p>\n<p>fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He</p>\n<p>was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>an hour.</p>\n<p>When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the</p>\n<p>light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not</p>\n<p>been called—persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled</p>\n<p>him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,</p>\n<p>feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had</p>\n<p>finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill</p>\n<p>to the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it</p>\n<p>was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into</p>\n<p>silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.</p>\n<p>After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in</p>\n<p>the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt</p>\n<p>wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs</p>\n<p>with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.</p>\n<p>This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now</p>\n<p>than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform</p>\n<p>over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that</p>\n<p>he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble</p>\n<p>confidence.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward</p>\n<p>Sid; and so the latter’s prompt retreat through the back gate was</p>\n<p>unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,</p>\n<p>along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the</p>\n<p>air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to</p>\n<p>trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his</p>\n<p>desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER X (cont.)</h3>\n<p>stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.</p>\n<p>His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time</p>\n<p>he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with</p>\n<p>a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal</p>\n<p>sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!</p>\n<p>This final feather broke the camel’s back.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>\n<p>Close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified</p>\n<p>with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;</p>\n<p>the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,</p>\n<p>with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave</p>\n<p>holiday for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of</p>\n<p>him if he had not.</p>\n<p>A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter—so the story ran. And</p>\n<p>it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself</p>\n<p>in the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and that Potter</p>\n<p>had at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially the washing</p>\n<p>which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had</p>\n<p>been ransacked for this “murderer” (the public are not slow in the</p>\n<p>matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every</p>\n<p>direction, and the Sheriff “was confident” that he would be captured</p>\n<p>before night.</p>\n<p>All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak</p>\n<p>vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not</p>\n<p>a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,</p>\n<p>unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.</p>\n<p>It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched</p>\n<p>his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry’s. Then both looked</p>\n<p>elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their</p>\n<p>mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly</p>\n<p>spectacle before them.</p>\n<p>“Poor fellow!” “Poor young fellow!” “This ought to be a lesson to grave</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>robbers!” “Muff Potter’ll hang for this if they catch him!” This was the</p>\n<p>drift of remark; and the minister said, “It was a judgment; His hand is</p>\n<p>here.”</p>\n<p>Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid</p>\n<p>face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,</p>\n<p>and voices shouted, “It’s him! it’s him! he’s coming himself!”</p>\n<p>“Who? Who?” from twenty voices.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Muff Potter!”</p>\n<p>“Hallo, he’s stopped!—Look out, he’s turning! Don’t let him get away!”</p>\n<p>People in the branches of the trees over Tom’s head said he wasn’t</p>\n<p>trying to get away—he only looked doubtful and perplexed.</p>\n<p>“Infernal impudence!” said a bystander; “wanted to come and take a quiet</p>\n<p>look at his work, I reckon—didn’t expect any company.”</p>\n<p>The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow’s face was haggard, and</p>\n<p>his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the</p>\n<p>murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands</p>\n<p>and burst into tears.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t do it, friends,” he sobbed; “’pon my word and honor I never</p>\n<p>done it.”</p>\n<p>“Who’s accused you?” shouted a voice.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around</p>\n<p>him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and</p>\n<p>exclaimed:</p>\n<p>“Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you’d never—”</p>\n<p>“Is that your knife?” and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.</p>\n<p>Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the</p>\n<p>ground. Then he said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Something told me ’t if I didn’t come back and get—” He shuddered; then</p>\n<p>waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, “Tell ’em,</p>\n<p>Joe, tell ’em—it ain’t any use any more.”</p>\n<p>Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the</p>\n<p>stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every</p>\n<p>moment that the clear sky would deliver God’s lightnings upon his head,</p>\n<p>and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to</p>\n<p>break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner’s life faded and</p>\n<p>vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and</p>\n<p>it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t you leave? What did you want to come here for?” somebody</p>\n<p>said.</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t help it—I couldn’t help it,” Potter moaned. “I wanted to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>run away, but I couldn’t seem to come anywhere but here.” And he fell to</p>\n<p>sobbing again.</p>\n<p>Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes</p>\n<p>afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the</p>\n<p>lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that</p>\n<p>Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most</p>\n<p>balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>not take their fascinated eyes from his face.</p>\n<p>They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should</p>\n<p>offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.</p>\n<p>Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in</p>\n<p>a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering</p>\n<p>crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy</p>\n<p>circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:</p>\n<p>“It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.”</p>\n<p>Tom’s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as</p>\n<p>much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:</p>\n<p>“Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me</p>\n<p>awake half the time.”</p>\n<p>Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“It’s a bad sign,” said Aunt Polly, gravely. “What you got on your mind,</p>\n<p>Tom?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing. Nothing ’t I know of.” But the boy’s hand shook so that he</p>\n<p>spilled his coffee.</p>\n<p>“And you do talk such stuff,” Sid said. “Last night you said, ‘It’s</p>\n<p>blood, it’s blood, that’s what it is!’ You said that over and over.</p>\n<p>And you said, ‘Don’t torment me so—I’ll tell!’ Tell _what_? What is it</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>you’ll tell?”</p>\n<p>Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have</p>\n<p>happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s face</p>\n<p>and she came to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said:</p>\n<p>“Sho! It’s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night</p>\n<p>myself. Sometimes I dream it’s me that done it.”</p>\n<p>Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after</p>\n<p>that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every</p>\n<p>night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently</p>\n<p>slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good</p>\n<p>while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place</p>\n<p>again. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew</p>\n<p>irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.</p>\n<p>It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding</p>\n<p>inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.</p>\n<p>Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,</p>\n<p>though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;</p>\n<p>he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness—and that was strange;</p>\n<p>and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,</p>\n<p>but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and</p>\n<p>ceased to torture Tom’s conscience.</p>\n<p>Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his</p>\n<p>opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such</p>\n<p>small comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of. The</p>\n<p>jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it</p>\n<p>was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom’s</p>\n<p>conscience.</p>\n<p>The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride</p>\n<p>him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character</p>\n<p>that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the</p>\n<p>matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery</p>\n<p>that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in</p>\n<p>the courts at present.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>\n<p>One of the reasons why Tom’s mind had drifted away from its secret</p>\n<p>troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest</p>\n<p>itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had</p>\n<p>struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to “whistle her down the</p>\n<p>wind,” but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father’s</p>\n<p>house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she</p>\n<p>should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there</p>\n<p>was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;</p>\n<p>there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to</p>\n<p>try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who</p>\n<p>are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of</p>\n<p>producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in</p>\n<p>these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,</p>\n<p>but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the</p>\n<p>“Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance</p>\n<p>they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they</p>\n<p>contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,</p>\n<p>and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and</p>\n<p>what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her</p>\n<p>health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they</p>\n<p>had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest</p>\n<p>as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered</p>\n<p>together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed</p>\n<p>with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with</p>\n<p>“hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering</p>\n<p>neighbors.</p>\n<p>The water treatment was new, now, and Tom’s low condition was a windfall</p>\n<p>to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the</p>\n<p>wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed</p>\n<p>him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she</p>\n<p>rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sweated his soul clean and “the yellow stains of it came through his</p>\n<p>pores”—as Tom said.</p>\n<p>Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and</p>\n<p>pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and</p>\n<p>plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the</p>\n<p>water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his</p>\n<p>capacity as she would a jug’s, and filled him up every day with quack</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>cure-alls.</p>\n<p>Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase</p>\n<p>filled the old lady’s heart with consternation. This indifference must</p>\n<p>be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first</p>\n<p>time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with</p>\n<p>gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water</p>\n<p>treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the</p>\n<p>result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;</p>\n<p>for the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not have shown a</p>\n<p>wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.</p>\n<p>Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be</p>\n<p>romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have</p>\n<p>too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of</p>\n<p>professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he</p>\n<p>became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and</p>\n<p>quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings</p>\n<p>to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle</p>\n<p>clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it</p>\n<p>did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the sitting-room floor with it.</p>\n<p>One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt’s yellow</p>\n<p>cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging</p>\n<p>for a taste. Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Don’t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.”</p>\n<p>But Peter signified that he did want it.</p>\n<p>“You better make sure.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Peter was sure.</p>\n<p>“Now you’ve asked for it, and I’ll give it to you, because there ain’t</p>\n<p>anything mean about me; but if you find you don’t like it, you mustn’t</p>\n<p>blame anybody but your own self.”</p>\n<p>Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down</p>\n<p>the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then</p>\n<p>delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next</p>\n<p>he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,</p>\n<p>with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his</p>\n<p>unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again</p>\n<p>spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time</p>\n<p>to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,</p>\n<p>and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over</p>\n<p>her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.</p>\n<p>“Tom, what on earth ails that cat?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, aunt,” gasped the boy.</p>\n<p>“Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?”</p>\n<p>“Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a</p>\n<p>good time.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“They do, do they?” There was something in the tone that made Tom</p>\n<p>apprehensive.</p>\n<p>“Yes’m. That is, I believe they do.”</p>\n<p>“You _do_?”</p>\n<p>“Yes’m.”</p>\n<p>The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized</p>\n<p>by anxiety. Too late he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it</p>\n<p>up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual</p>\n<p>handle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.</p>\n<p>“Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?”</p>\n<p>“I done it out of pity for him—because he hadn’t any aunt.”</p>\n<p>“Hadn’t any aunt!—you numskull. What has that got to do with it?”</p>\n<p>“Heaps. Because if he’d had one she’d a burnt him out herself! She’d a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>roasted his bowels out of him ’thout any more feeling than if he was a</p>\n<p>human!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in</p>\n<p>a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.</p>\n<p>She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she</p>\n<p>put her hand on Tom’s head and said gently:</p>\n<p>“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping</p>\n<p>through his gravity.</p>\n<p>“I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It</p>\n<p>done _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since—”</p>\n<p>“Oh, go ’long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try</p>\n<p>and see if you can’t be a good boy, for once, and you needn’t take any</p>\n<p>more medicine.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing</p>\n<p>had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,</p>\n<p>he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his</p>\n<p>comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to</p>\n<p>be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road.</p>\n<p>Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed</p>\n<p>a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about</p>\n<p>Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and</p>\n<p>watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the</p>\n<p>owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks</p>\n<p>ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered</p>\n<p>the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed</p>\n<p>in at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,</p>\n<p>jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,</p>\n<p>standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,</p>\n<p>and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher</p>\n<p>was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never</p>\n<p>looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?</p>\n<p>He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,</p>\n<p>broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and</p>\n<p>fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and</p>\n<p>she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some</p>\n<p>people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”</p>\n<p>Tom’s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and</p>\n<p>crestfallen.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>\n<p>Tom’s mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a</p>\n<p>forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out</p>\n<p>what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried</p>\n<p>to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing</p>\n<p>would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame</p>\n<p>_him_ for the consequences—why shouldn’t they? What right had the</p>\n<p>friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>lead a life of crime. There was no choice.</p>\n<p>By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to</p>\n<p>“take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he</p>\n<p>should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more—it was very</p>\n<p>hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold</p>\n<p>world, he must submit—but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and</p>\n<p>fast.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Just at this point he met his soul’s sworn comrade, Joe</p>\n<p>Harper—hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his</p>\n<p>heart. Plainly here were “two souls with but a single thought.” Tom,</p>\n<p>wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about</p>\n<p>a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by</p>\n<p>roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping</p>\n<p>that Joe would not forget him.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going</p>\n<p>to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother</p>\n<p>had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and</p>\n<p>knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished</p>\n<p>him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but</p>\n<p>succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her</p>\n<p>poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand</p>\n<p>by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved</p>\n<p>them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for</p>\n<p>being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,</p>\n<p>some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he</p>\n<p>conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of</p>\n<p>crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River</p>\n<p>was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,</p>\n<p>with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a</p>\n<p>rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further</p>\n<p>shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s</p>\n<p>Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a</p>\n<p>matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was</p>\n<p>indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the</p>\n<p>river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was</p>\n<p>midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.</p>\n<p>Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal</p>\n<p>in the most dark and mysterious way—as became outlaws. And before the</p>\n<p>afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All</p>\n<p>who got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.”</p>\n<p>About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,</p>\n<p>and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the</p>\n<p>meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay</p>\n<p>like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the</p>\n<p>quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the</p>\n<p>same way. Then a guarded voice said:</p>\n<p>“Who goes there?”</p>\n<p>“Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.”</p>\n<p>“Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.” Tom</p>\n<p>had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.</p>\n<p>“’Tis well. Give the countersign.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the</p>\n<p>brooding night:</p>\n<p>“_Blood_!”</p>\n<p>Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,</p>\n<p>tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was</p>\n<p>an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked</p>\n<p>the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn</p>\n<p>himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a</p>\n<p>skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought</p>\n<p>a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or</p>\n<p>“chewed” but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it</p>\n<p>would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;</p>\n<p>matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily</p>\n<p>thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing</p>\n<p>adventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and suddenly</p>\n<p>halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;</p>\n<p>and giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe” stirred, to “let</p>\n<p>him have it to the hilt,” because “dead men tell no tales.” They knew</p>\n<p>well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their</p>\n<p>conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.</p>\n<p>They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and</p>\n<p>Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded</p>\n<p>arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:</p>\n<p>“Luff, and bring her to the wind!”</p>\n<p>“Aye-aye, sir!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Steady, steady-y-y-y!”</p>\n<p>“Steady it is, sir!”</p>\n<p>“Let her go off a point!”</p>\n<p>“Point it is, sir!”</p>\n<p>As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream</p>\n<p>it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for</p>\n<p>“style,” and were not intended to mean anything in particular.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“What sail’s she carrying?”</p>\n<p>“Courses, tops’ls, and flying-jib, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Send the r’yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of</p>\n<p>ye—foretopmaststuns’l! Lively, now!”</p>\n<p>“Aye-aye, sir!”</p>\n<p>“Shake out that maintogalans’l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!”</p>\n<p>“Aye-aye, sir!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Hellum-a-lee—hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,</p>\n<p>port! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!”</p>\n<p>“Steady it is, sir!”</p>\n<p>The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head</p>\n<p>right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was</p>\n<p>not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during</p>\n<p>the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,</p>\n<p>peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,</p>\n<p>unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black</p>\n<p>Avenger stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the scene</p>\n<p>of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she” could see</p>\n<p>him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless</p>\n<p>heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond</p>\n<p>eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and</p>\n<p>satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and</p>\n<p>they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift</p>\n<p>them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in</p>\n<p>time, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the</p>\n<p>raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part</p>\n<p>of the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they</p>\n<p>spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;</p>\n<p>but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as</p>\n<p>became outlaws.</p>\n<p>They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps</p>\n<p>within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn “pone” stock</p>\n<p>they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,</p>\n<p>free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,</p>\n<p>far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to</p>\n<p>civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy</p>\n<p>glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the</p>\n<p>varnished foliage and festooning vines.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance</p>\n<p>of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,</p>\n<p>filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but</p>\n<p>they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting</p>\n<p>campfire.</p>\n<p>“_Ain’t_ it gay?” said Joe.</p>\n<p>“It’s _nuts_!” said Tom. “What would the boys say if they could see us?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Say? Well, they’d just die to be here—hey, Hucky!”</p>\n<p>“I reckon so,” said Huckleberry; “anyways, I’m suited. I don’t want</p>\n<p>nothing better’n this. I don’t ever get enough to eat, gen’ally—and here</p>\n<p>they can’t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.”</p>\n<p>“It’s just the life for me,” said Tom. “You don’t have to get up,</p>\n<p>mornings, and you don’t have to go to school, and wash, and all that</p>\n<p>blame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t have to do _anything_, Joe,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>when he’s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and</p>\n<p>then he don’t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yes, that’s so,” said Joe, “but I hadn’t thought much about it, you</p>\n<p>know. I’d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I’ve tried it.”</p>\n<p>“You see,” said Tom, “people don’t go much on hermits, nowadays, like</p>\n<p>they used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected. And</p>\n<p>a hermit’s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and—”</p>\n<p>“What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?” inquired Huck.</p>\n<p>“I dono. But they’ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You’d have to do</p>\n<p>that if you was a hermit.”</p>\n<p>“Dern’d if I would,” said Huck.</p>\n<p>“Well, what would you do?”</p>\n<p>“I dono. But I wouldn’t do that.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Why, Huck, you’d _have_ to. How’d you get around it?”</p>\n<p>“Why, I just wouldn’t stand it. I’d run away.”</p>\n<p>“Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You’d be</p>\n<p>a disgrace.”</p>\n<p>The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished</p>\n<p>gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with</p>\n<p>tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>fragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The</p>\n<p>other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to</p>\n<p>acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:</p>\n<p>“What does pirates have to do?”</p>\n<p>Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them, and get the</p>\n<p>money and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a</p>\n<p>plank.”</p>\n<p>“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the</p>\n<p>women.”</p>\n<p>“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women—they’re too noble. And</p>\n<p>the women’s always beautiful, too.”</p>\n<p>“And don’t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>“Who?” said Huck.</p>\n<p>“Why, the pirates.”</p>\n<p>Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.</p>\n<p>“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with a</p>\n<p>regretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got none but these.”</p>\n<p>But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand</p>\n<p>that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for</p>\n<p>wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the</p>\n<p>eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the</p>\n<p>Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.</p>\n<p>The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,</p>\n<p>and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them</p>\n<p>kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at</p>\n<p>all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they</p>\n<p>might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at</p>\n<p>once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an</p>\n<p>intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and</p>\n<p>next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.</p>\n<p>They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had</p>\n<p>purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not</p>\n<p>to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the</p>\n<p>end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking</p>\n<p>sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that</p>\n<p>in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in</p>\n<p>the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the</p>\n<p>crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously</p>\n<p>inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>\n<p>When Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and</p>\n<p>rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool</p>\n<p>gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the</p>\n<p>deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not</p>\n<p>a sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood</p>\n<p>upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,</p>\n<p>and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>still slept.</p>\n<p>Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently</p>\n<p>the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray</p>\n<p>of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life</p>\n<p>manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going</p>\n<p>to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came</p>\n<p>crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he</p>\n<p>was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own</p>\n<p>accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,</p>\n<p>by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to</p>\n<p>go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its</p>\n<p>curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and</p>\n<p>began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a</p>\n<p>doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,</p>\n<p>from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled</p>\n<p>manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,</p>\n<p>and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed</p>\n<p>the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and</p>\n<p>said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which</p>\n<p>did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was</p>\n<p>credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity</p>\n<p>more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and</p>\n<p>Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body</p>\n<p>and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A</p>\n<p>catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then</p>\n<p>a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig</p>\n<p>almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the</p>\n<p>strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow</p>\n<p>of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to</p>\n<p>inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never</p>\n<p>seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight</p>\n<p>pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few</p>\n<p>butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.</p>\n<p>Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with</p>\n<p>a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and</p>\n<p>tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white</p>\n<p>sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a</p>\n<p>slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only</p>\n<p>gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge</p>\n<p>between them and civilization.</p>\n<p>They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and</p>\n<p>ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a</p>\n<p>spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood</p>\n<p>charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe</p>\n<p>was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a</p>\n<p>minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in</p>\n<p>their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time</p>\n<p>to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,</p>\n<p>a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish—provisions enough for quite a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for</p>\n<p>no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the</p>\n<p>quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better</p>\n<p>he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,</p>\n<p>open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.</p>\n<p>They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,</p>\n<p>and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,</p>\n<p>among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the</p>\n<p>ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came</p>\n<p>upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.</p>\n<p>They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be</p>\n<p>astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles</p>\n<p>long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards</p>\n<p>wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle</p>\n<p>of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to</p>\n<p>stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw</p>\n<p>themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,</p>\n<p>and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,</p>\n<p>and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This</p>\n<p>took dim shape, presently—it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the</p>\n<p>Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they</p>\n<p>were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak</p>\n<p>his thought.</p>\n<p>For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar</p>\n<p>sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound</p>\n<p>became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,</p>\n<p>glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There</p>\n<p>was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came</p>\n<p>floating down out of the distance.</p>\n<p>“What is it!” exclaimed Joe, under his breath.</p>\n<p>“I wonder,” said Tom in a whisper.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“’Tain’t thunder,” said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, “becuz thunder—”</p>\n<p>“Hark!” said Tom. “Listen—don’t talk.”</p>\n<p>They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom</p>\n<p>troubled the solemn hush.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go and see.”</p>\n<p>They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They</p>\n<p>parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the</p>\n<p>current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great</p>\n<p>many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood</p>\n<p>of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in</p>\n<p>them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the</p>\n<p>ferryboat’s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same</p>\n<p>dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I know now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody’s drownded!”</p>\n<p>“That’s it!” said Huck; “they done that last summer, when Bill Turner</p>\n<p>got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes</p>\n<p>him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put</p>\n<p>quicksilver in ’em and set ’em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody</p>\n<p>that’s drownded, they’ll float right there and stop.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” said Joe. “I wonder what makes the bread</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>do that.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, it ain’t the bread, so much,” said Tom; “I reckon it’s mostly what</p>\n<p>they _say_ over it before they start it out.”</p>\n<p>“But they don’t say anything over it,” said Huck. “I’ve seen ’em and</p>\n<p>they don’t.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s funny,” said Tom. “But maybe they say it to themselves. Of</p>\n<p>_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because</p>\n<p>an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not</p>\n<p>be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such</p>\n<p>gravity.</p>\n<p>“By jings, I wish I was over there, now,” said Joe.</p>\n<p>“I do too,” said Huck. “I’d give heaps to know who it is.”</p>\n<p>The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>flashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:</p>\n<p>“Boys, I know who’s drownded—it’s us!”</p>\n<p>They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they</p>\n<p>were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;</p>\n<p>tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor</p>\n<p>lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being</p>\n<p>indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was</p>\n<p>concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.</p>\n<p>As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business</p>\n<p>and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were</p>\n<p>jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble</p>\n<p>they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then</p>\n<p>fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were</p>\n<p>gratifying to look upon—from their point of view. But when the shadows</p>\n<p>of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing</p>\n<p>into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The</p>\n<p>excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts</p>\n<p>of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as</p>\n<p>much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a</p>\n<p>roundabout “feeler” as to how the others might look upon a return to</p>\n<p>civilization—not right now, but—</p>\n<p>Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined</p>\n<p>in with Tom, and the waverer quickly “explained,” and was glad to get</p>\n<p>out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness</p>\n<p>clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>rest for the moment.</p>\n<p>As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.</p>\n<p>Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,</p>\n<p>watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,</p>\n<p>and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung</p>\n<p>by the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders</p>\n<p>of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something</p>\n<p>upon each of these with his “red keel”; one he rolled up and put in his</p>\n<p>jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe’s hat and removed it to a</p>\n<p>little distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain</p>\n<p>schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value—among them a lump of</p>\n<p>chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind</p>\n<p>of marbles known as a “sure ’nough crystal.” Then he tiptoed his way</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and</p>\n<p>straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>\n<p>A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward</p>\n<p>the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway</p>\n<p>over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out</p>\n<p>confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering</p>\n<p>upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had</p>\n<p>expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till</p>\n<p>he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,</p>\n<p>following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten</p>\n<p>o’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the</p>\n<p>ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything</p>\n<p>was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching</p>\n<p>with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes</p>\n<p>and climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.</p>\n<p>Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast</p>\n<p>off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up,</p>\n<p>against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in</p>\n<p>his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At</p>\n<p>the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and</p>\n<p>Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.</p>\n<p>He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his</p>\n<p>aunt’s back fence. He climbed over, approached the “ell,” and looked</p>\n<p>in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There</p>\n<p>sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together,</p>\n<p>talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the</p>\n<p>door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing</p>\n<p>cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might</p>\n<p>squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,</p>\n<p>warily.</p>\n<p>“What makes the candle blow so?” said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why,</p>\n<p>that door’s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange</p>\n<p>things now. Go ’long and shut it, Sid.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and “breathed”</p>\n<p>himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his</p>\n<p>aunt’s foot.</p>\n<p>“But as I was saying,” said Aunt Polly, “he warn’t _bad_, so to say—only</p>\n<p>misch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn’t</p>\n<p>any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was</p>\n<p>the best-hearted boy that ever was”—and she began to cry.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“It was just so with my Joe—always full of his devilment, and up to</p>\n<p>every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he</p>\n<p>could be—and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking</p>\n<p>that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because</p>\n<p>it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,</p>\n<p>never, poor abused boy!” And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would</p>\n<p>break.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I hope Tom’s better off where he is,” said Sid, “but if he’d been</p>\n<p>better in some ways—”</p>\n<p>“_Sid!_” Tom felt the glare of the old lady’s eye, though he could not</p>\n<p>see it. “Not a word against my Tom, now that he’s gone! God’ll take care</p>\n<p>of _him_—never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don’t</p>\n<p>know how to give him up! I don’t know how to give him up! He was such a</p>\n<p>comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, ’most.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away—Blessed be the name of</p>\n<p>the Lord! But it’s so hard—Oh, it’s so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe</p>\n<p>busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.</p>\n<p>Little did I know then, how soon—Oh, if it was to do over again I’d hug</p>\n<p>him and bless him for it.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just</p>\n<p>exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would</p>\n<p>tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s head with my</p>\n<p>thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he’s out of all his troubles now.</p>\n<p>And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach—”</p>\n<p>But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely</p>\n<p>down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself—and more in pity of himself than</p>\n<p>anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself</p>\n<p>than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt’s grief</p>\n<p>to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy—and</p>\n<p>the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his</p>\n<p>nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.</p>\n<p>He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was</p>\n<p>conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing</p>\n<p>lads had promised that the village should “hear something” soon; the</p>\n<p>wise-heads had “put this and that together” and decided that the lads</p>\n<p>had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,</p>\n<p>presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the</p>\n<p>Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village—and then hope</p>\n<p>perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the</p>\n<p>bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must</p>\n<p>have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would</p>\n<p>otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies</p>\n<p>continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the</p>\n<p>funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s</p>\n<p>arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was</p>\n<p>tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid</p>\n<p>snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.</p>\n<p>Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,</p>\n<p>and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,</p>\n<p>that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making</p>\n<p>broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and</p>\n<p>turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her</p>\n<p>sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the</p>\n<p>candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full</p>\n<p>of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the</p>\n<p>candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark</p>\n<p>hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and</p>\n<p>straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.</p>\n<p>He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large</p>\n<p>there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was</p>\n<p>tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and</p>\n<p>slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a</p>\n<p>mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself</p>\n<p>stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for</p>\n<p>this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture</p>\n<p>the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore</p>\n<p>legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be</p>\n<p>made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>entered the woods.</p>\n<p>He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep</p>\n<p>awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far</p>\n<p>spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the</p>\n<p>island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the</p>\n<p>great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A</p>\n<p>little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>heard Joe say:</p>\n<p>“No, Tom’s true-blue, Huck, and he’ll come back. He won’t desert. He</p>\n<p>knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom’s too proud for that</p>\n<p>sort of thing. He’s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?”</p>\n<p>“Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain’t they?”</p>\n<p>“Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain’t</p>\n<p>back here to breakfast.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Which he is!” exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping</p>\n<p>grandly into camp.</p>\n<p>A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the</p>\n<p>boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.</p>\n<p>They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.</p>\n<p>Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the</p>\n<p>other pirates got ready to fish and explore.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>\n<p>After dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.</p>\n<p>They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft</p>\n<p>place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes</p>\n<p>they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly</p>\n<p>round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a</p>\n<p>famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.</p>\n<p>After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until</p>\n<p>they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal</p>\n<p>water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their</p>\n<p>legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.</p>\n<p>And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each</p>\n<p>other’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with</p>\n<p>averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all</p>\n<p>went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,</p>\n<p>sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.</p>\n<p>When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,</p>\n<p>hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by</p>\n<p>break for the water again and go through the original performance once</p>\n<p>more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>flesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and</p>\n<p>had a circus—with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest</p>\n<p>post to his neighbor.</p>\n<p>Next they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and</p>\n<p>“keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another</p>\n<p>swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off</p>\n<p>his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the</p>\n<p>protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he</p>\n<p>had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to</p>\n<p>rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the “dumps,” and</p>\n<p>fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay</p>\n<p>drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing “BECKY” in the sand with</p>\n<p>his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He</p>\n<p>erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving</p>\n<p>the other boys together and joining them.</p>\n<p>But Joe’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so</p>\n<p>homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay</p>\n<p>very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,</p>\n<p>but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he</p>\n<p>would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:</p>\n<p>“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore</p>\n<p>it again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light</p>\n<p>on a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”</p>\n<p>But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.</p>\n<p>Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking</p>\n<p>very gloomy. Finally he said:</p>\n<p>“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”</p>\n<p>“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the</p>\n<p>fishing that’s here.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”</p>\n<p>“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there</p>\n<p>ain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I</p>\n<p>ain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.</p>\n<p>“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor</p>\n<p>thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”</p>\n<p>Huck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.</p>\n<p>“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising.</p>\n<p>“There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.</p>\n<p>“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long home and get</p>\n<p>laughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll</p>\n<p>stay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>along without him, per’aps.”</p>\n<p>But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly</p>\n<p>on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying</p>\n<p>Joe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.</p>\n<p>Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the</p>\n<p>Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck</p>\n<p>could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now</p>\n<p>it’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, I better go.”</p>\n<p>“Well, go ’long—who’s hendering you.”</p>\n<p>Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:</p>\n<p>“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>when we get to shore.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”</p>\n<p>Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a</p>\n<p>strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along</p>\n<p>too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It</p>\n<p>suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made</p>\n<p>one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>yelling:</p>\n<p>“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”</p>\n<p>They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they</p>\n<p>were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till</p>\n<p>at last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a</p>\n<p>warwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had</p>\n<p>told them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret</p>\n<p>would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had</p>\n<p>meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.</p>\n<p>The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,</p>\n<p>chattering all the time about Tom’s stupendous plan and admiring the</p>\n<p>genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to</p>\n<p>learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never</p>\n<p>smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the</p>\n<p>tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.</p>\n<p>Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,</p>\n<p>charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,</p>\n<p>and they gagged a little, but Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>ago.”</p>\n<p>“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish</p>\n<p>I could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.</p>\n<p>“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just</p>\n<p>that way—haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”</p>\n<p>“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the</p>\n<p>slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and</p>\n<p>Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember,</p>\n<p>Huck, ’bout me saying that?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white</p>\n<p>alley. No, ’twas the day before.”</p>\n<p>“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel</p>\n<p>sick.”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff</p>\n<p>Thatcher couldn’t.”</p>\n<p>“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him</p>\n<p>try it once. _He’d_ see!”</p>\n<p>“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>it once.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more</p>\n<p>do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.”</p>\n<p>“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”</p>\n<p>“So do I.”</p>\n<p>“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re</p>\n<p>around, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>And you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll</p>\n<p>say, ‘Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t</p>\n<p>very good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s _strong_</p>\n<p>enough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as</p>\n<p>ca’m, and then just see ’em look!”</p>\n<p>“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!”</p>\n<p>“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>won’t they wish they’d been along?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just _bet_ they will!”</p>\n<p>So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and</p>\n<p>grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously</p>\n<p>increased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting</p>\n<p>fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues</p>\n<p>fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings</p>\n<p>followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,</p>\n<p>now. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both</p>\n<p>fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and</p>\n<p>main. Joe said feebly:</p>\n<p>“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”</p>\n<p>Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.</p>\n<p>No, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”</p>\n<p>So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,</p>\n<p>and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both</p>\n<p>very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had</p>\n<p>had any trouble they had got rid of it.</p>\n<p>They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare</p>\n<p>theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate</p>\n<p>at dinner had disagreed with them.</p>\n<p>About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding</p>\n<p>oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys</p>\n<p>huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of</p>\n<p>the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.</p>\n<p>Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the</p>\n<p>blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that</p>\n<p>vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by</p>\n<p>another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came</p>\n<p>sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting</p>\n<p>breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned</p>\n<p>night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and</p>\n<p>distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,</p>\n<p>startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling</p>\n<p>down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A</p>\n<p>sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the</p>\n<p>flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops</p>\n<p>right over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick</p>\n<p>gloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.</p>\n<p>“Quick! boys, go for the tent!” exclaimed Tom.</p>\n<p>They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no</p>\n<p>two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through</p>\n<p>the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching</p>\n<p>rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the</p>\n<p>ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the</p>\n<p>booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one</p>\n<p>they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,</p>\n<p>and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something</p>\n<p>to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest</p>\n<p>rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its</p>\n<p>fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each</p>\n<p>others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter</p>\n<p>of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its</p>\n<p>highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed</p>\n<p>in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the</p>\n<p>driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on</p>\n<p>the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting</p>\n<p>veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight</p>\n<p>and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging</p>\n<p>thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,</p>\n<p>and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to</p>\n<p>the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one</p>\n<p>and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be</p>\n<p>out in.</p>\n<p>But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and</p>\n<p>weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The</p>\n<p>boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter</p>\n<p>of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were</p>\n<p>not under it when the catastrophe happened.</p>\n<p>Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but</p>\n<p>heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against</p>\n<p>rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and</p>\n<p>chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had</p>\n<p>been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from</p>\n<p>the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they</p>\n<p>patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under</p>\n<p>sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they</p>\n<p>piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were</p>\n<p>gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their</p>\n<p>midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep</p>\n<p>on, anywhere around.</p>\n<p>As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over</p>\n<p>them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got</p>\n<p>scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After</p>\n<p>the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as</p>\n<p>he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or</p>\n<p>anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of</p>\n<p>cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was</p>\n<p>to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.</p>\n<p>They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were</p>\n<p>stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through</p>\n<p>the woods to attack an English settlement.</p>\n<p>By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each</p>\n<p>other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each</p>\n<p>other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely</p>\n<p>satisfactory one.</p>\n<p>They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of</p>\n<p>hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple</p>\n<p>impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other</p>\n<p>process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished</p>\n<p>they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such</p>\n<p>show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and</p>\n<p>took their whiff as it passed, in due form.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had</p>\n<p>gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without</p>\n<p>having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to</p>\n<p>be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high</p>\n<p>promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,</p>\n<p>with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were</p>\n<p>prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to</p>\n<p>smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at</p>\n<p>present.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>\n<p>But there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday</p>\n<p>afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly’s family, were being put into</p>\n<p>mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed</p>\n<p>the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.</p>\n<p>The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked</p>\n<p>little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to</p>\n<p>the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>up.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted</p>\n<p>schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing</p>\n<p>there to comfort her. She soliloquized:</p>\n<p>“Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven’t got</p>\n<p>anything now to remember him by.” And she choked back a little sob.</p>\n<p>Presently she stopped, and said to herself:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn’t say</p>\n<p>that—I wouldn’t say it for the whole world. But he’s gone now; I’ll</p>\n<p>never, never, never see him any more.”</p>\n<p>This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling</p>\n<p>down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls—playmates of Tom’s</p>\n<p>and Joe’s—came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking</p>\n<p>in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful</p>\n<p>prophecy, as they could easily see now!)—and each speaker pointed out</p>\n<p>the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added</p>\n<p>something like “and I was a-standing just so—just as I am now, and as if</p>\n<p>you was him—I was as close as that—and he smiled, just this way—and then</p>\n<p>something seemed to go all over me, like—awful, you know—and I never</p>\n<p>thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and</p>\n<p>many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or</p>\n<p>less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided</p>\n<p>who _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,</p>\n<p>the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,</p>\n<p>and were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had</p>\n<p>no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>remembrance:</p>\n<p>“Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.”</p>\n<p>But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,</p>\n<p>and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,</p>\n<p>still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.</p>\n<p>When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell</p>\n<p>began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush</p>\n<p>that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment</p>\n<p>in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there</p>\n<p>was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses</p>\n<p>as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None</p>\n<p>could remember when the little church had been so full before. There</p>\n<p>was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in</p>\n<p>deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose</p>\n<p>reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.</p>\n<p>There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled</p>\n<p>sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving</p>\n<p>hymn was sung, and the text followed: “I am the Resurrection and the</p>\n<p>Life.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the</p>\n<p>graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that</p>\n<p>every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang</p>\n<p>in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always</p>\n<p>before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor</p>\n<p>boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the</p>\n<p>departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes</p>\n<p>were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had</p>\n<p>seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation</p>\n<p>became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last</p>\n<p>the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus</p>\n<p>of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and</p>\n<p>crying in the pulpit.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later</p>\n<p>the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above</p>\n<p>his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair</p>\n<p>of eyes followed the minister’s, and then almost with one impulse the</p>\n<p>congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up</p>\n<p>the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,</p>\n<p>sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>listening to their own funeral sermon!</p>\n<p>Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored</p>\n<p>ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while</p>\n<p>poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what</p>\n<p>to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and</p>\n<p>started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:</p>\n<p>“Aunt Polly, it ain’t fair. Somebody’s got to be glad to see Huck.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“And so they shall. I’m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!” And</p>\n<p>the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing</p>\n<p>capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: “Praise God from</p>\n<p>whom all blessings flow—_sing_!—and put your hearts in it!”</p>\n<p>And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and</p>\n<p>while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the</p>\n<p>proudest moment of his life.</p>\n<p>As the “sold” congregation trooped out they said they would almost be</p>\n<p>willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that</p>\n<p>once more.</p>\n<p>Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day—according to Aunt Polly’s varying</p>\n<p>moods—than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>\n<p>That was Tom’s great secret—the scheme to return home with his brother</p>\n<p>pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the</p>\n<p>Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles</p>\n<p>below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town</p>\n<p>till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys</p>\n<p>and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of</p>\n<p>invalided benches.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to</p>\n<p>Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of</p>\n<p>talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:</p>\n<p>“Well, I don’t say it wasn’t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody</p>\n<p>suffering ’most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you</p>\n<p>could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over</p>\n<p>on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>hint some way that you warn’t dead, but only run off.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you could have done that, Tom,” said Mary; “and I believe you</p>\n<p>would if you had thought of it.”</p>\n<p>“Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. “Say,</p>\n<p>now, would you, if you’d thought of it?”</p>\n<p>“I—well, I don’t know. ’Twould ’a’ spoiled everything.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,” said Aunt Polly, with a grieved</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>tone that discomforted the boy. “It would have been something if you’d</p>\n<p>cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn’t _do_ it.”</p>\n<p>“Now, auntie, that ain’t any harm,” pleaded Mary; “it’s only Tom’s giddy</p>\n<p>way—he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.”</p>\n<p>“More’s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and</p>\n<p>_done_ it, too. Tom, you’ll look back, some day, when it’s too late,</p>\n<p>and wish you’d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>little.”</p>\n<p>“Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,” said Tom.</p>\n<p>“I’d know it better if you acted more like it.”</p>\n<p>“I wish now I’d thought,” said Tom, with a repentant tone; “but I dreamt</p>\n<p>about you, anyway. That’s something, ain’t it?”</p>\n<p>“It ain’t much—a cat does that much—but it’s better than nothing. What</p>\n<p>did you dream?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the</p>\n<p>bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.”</p>\n<p>“Well, so we did. So we always do. I’m glad your dreams could take even</p>\n<p>that much trouble about us.”</p>\n<p>“And I dreamt that Joe Harper’s mother was here.”</p>\n<p>“Why, she was here!

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, try to recollect—can’t you?”</p>\n<p>“Somehow it seems to me that the wind—the wind blowed the—the—”</p>\n<p>“Try harder, Tom!

I’m thankful to the good</p>\n<p>God and Father of us all I’ve got you back, that’s long-suffering and</p>\n<p>merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness</p>\n<p>knows I’m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings</p>\n<p>and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there’s few enough</p>\n<p>would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.</p>\n<p>Go ’long Sid, Mary, Tom—take yourselves off—you’ve hendered me long</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>enough.”</p>\n<p>The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper</p>\n<p>and vanquish her realism with Tom’s marvellous dream. Sid had better</p>\n<p>judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the</p>\n<p>house. It was this: “Pretty thin—as long a dream as that, without any</p>\n<p>mistakes in it!”</p>\n<p>What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the</p>\n<p>public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see</p>\n<p>the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and</p>\n<p>drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud</p>\n<p>to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer</p>\n<p>at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into</p>\n<p>town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have</p>\n<p>given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his</p>\n<p>glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a</p>\n<p>circus.</p>\n<p>At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered</p>\n<p>such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were</p>\n<p>not long in becoming insufferably “stuck-up.” They began to tell their</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>adventures to hungry listeners—but they only began; it was not a</p>\n<p>thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish</p>\n<p>material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely</p>\n<p>puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.</p>\n<p>Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory</p>\n<p>was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,</p>\n<p>maybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her—she should see</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she</p>\n<p>arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group</p>\n<p>of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was</p>\n<p>tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,</p>\n<p>pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter</p>\n<p>when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her</p>\n<p>captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity</p>\n<p>that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up”</p>\n<p>the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he</p>\n<p>knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved</p>\n<p>irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and</p>\n<p>wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more</p>\n<p>particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her</p>\n<p>feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to</p>\n<p>a girl almost at Tom’s elbow—with sham vivacity:</p>\n<p>“Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn’t you come to Sunday-school?”</p>\n<p>“I did come—didn’t you see me?”</p>\n<p>“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”</p>\n<p>“I was in Miss Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw _you_.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to tell you about</p>\n<p>the picnic.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to give it?”</p>\n<p>“My ma’s going to let me have one.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, goody; I hope she’ll let _me_ come.”</p>\n<p>“Well, she will. The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody come that I</p>\n<p>want, and I want you.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“That’s ever so nice. When is it going to be?”</p>\n<p>“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, every one that’s friends to me—or wants to be”; and she glanced</p>\n<p>ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence</p>\n<p>about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the</p>\n<p>great sycamore tree “all to flinders” while he was “standing within</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>three feet of it.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“And me?” said Sally Rogers.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged</p>\n<p>for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still</p>\n<p>talking, and took Amy with him. Becky’s lips trembled and the tears</p>\n<p>came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on</p>\n<p>chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of</p>\n<p>everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and</p>\n<p>had what her sex call “a good cry.” Then she sat moody, with wounded</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast</p>\n<p>in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what</p>\n<p>_she’d_ do.</p>\n<p>At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant</p>\n<p>self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate</p>\n<p>her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden</p>\n<p>falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple—and so</p>\n<p>absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,</p>\n<p>that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.</p>\n<p>Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for</p>\n<p>throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He</p>\n<p>called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He</p>\n<p>wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He</p>\n<p>did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly</p>\n<p>he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced</p>\n<p>as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and</p>\n<p>again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could</p>\n<p>not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that</p>\n<p>Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her</p>\n<p>fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.</p>\n<p>Amy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had</p>\n<p>to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in</p>\n<p>vain—the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, ain’t I ever going</p>\n<p>to get rid of her?” At last he must be attending to those things—and she</p>\n<p>said artlessly that she would be “around” when school let out. And he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>hastened away, hating her for it.</p>\n<p>“Any other boy!” Tom thought, grating his teeth. “Any boy in the whole</p>\n<p>town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is</p>\n<p>aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this</p>\n<p>town, mister, and I’ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you</p>\n<p>out! I’ll just take and—”</p>\n<p>And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy—pummelling</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the air, and kicking and gouging. “Oh, you do, do you? You holler</p>\n<p>’nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!” And so the imaginary</p>\n<p>flogging was finished to his satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy’s</p>\n<p>grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other</p>\n<p>distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the</p>\n<p>minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,</p>\n<p>and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at</p>\n<p>a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew</p>\n<p>entirely miserable and wished she hadn’t carried it so far. When</p>\n<p>poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept</p>\n<p>exclaiming: “Oh, here’s a jolly one! look at this!” she lost patience at</p>\n<p>last, and said, “Oh, don’t bother me! I don’t care for them!” and burst</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>into tears, and got up and walked away.</p>\n<p>Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Go away and leave me alone, can’t you! I hate you!”</p>\n<p>So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done—for she had said</p>\n<p>she would look at pictures all through the nooning—and she walked on,</p>\n<p>crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth—the girl</p>\n<p>had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.</p>\n<p>He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.</p>\n<p>He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much</p>\n<p>risk to himself. Tom’s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his</p>\n<p>opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and</p>\n<p>poured ink upon the page.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,</p>\n<p>and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,</p>\n<p>intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their</p>\n<p>troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she</p>\n<p>had changed her mind. The thought of Tom’s treatment of her when she was</p>\n<p>talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.</p>\n<p>She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book’s</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>\n<p>Tom arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said</p>\n<p>to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising</p>\n<p>market:</p>\n<p>“Tom, I’ve a notion to skin you alive!”</p>\n<p>“Auntie, what have I done?”</p>\n<p>“Well, you’ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old</p>\n<p>softy, expecting I’m going to make her believe all that rubbage about</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>that dream, when lo and behold you she’d found out from Joe that you was</p>\n<p>over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don’t know</p>\n<p>what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so</p>\n<p>bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool</p>\n<p>of myself and never say a word.”</p>\n<p>This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had</p>\n<p>seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to</p>\n<p>say for a moment. Then he said:</p>\n<p>“Auntie, I wish I hadn’t done it—but I didn’t think.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your</p>\n<p>own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from</p>\n<p>Jackson’s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could</p>\n<p>think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn’t ever think</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to pity us and save us from sorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn’t mean to be mean. I didn’t,</p>\n<p>honest. And besides, I didn’t come over here to laugh at you that</p>\n<p>night.”</p>\n<p>“What did you come for, then?”</p>\n<p>“It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn’t got</p>\n<p>drownded.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could</p>\n<p>believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never</p>\n<p>did—and I know it, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed and ’deed I did, auntie—I wish I may never stir if I didn’t.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Tom, don’t lie—don’t do it. It only makes things a hundred times</p>\n<p>worse.”</p>\n<p>“It ain’t a lie, auntie; it’s the truth. I wanted to keep you from</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>grieving—that was all that made me come.”</p>\n<p>“I’d give the whole world to believe that—it would cover up a power</p>\n<p>of sins, Tom. I’d ’most be glad you’d run off and acted so bad. But it</p>\n<p>ain’t reasonable; because, why didn’t you tell me, child?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all</p>\n<p>full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn’t</p>\n<p>somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>kept mum.”</p>\n<p>“What bark?”</p>\n<p>“The bark I had wrote on to tell you we’d gone pirating. I wish, now,</p>\n<p>you’d waked up when I kissed you—I do, honest.”</p>\n<p>The hard lines in his aunt’s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned</p>\n<p>in her eyes.</p>\n<p>“_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Why, yes, I did.”</p>\n<p>“Are you sure you did, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“Why, yes, I did, auntie—certain sure.”</p>\n<p>“What did you kiss me for, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.”</p>\n<p>The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in</p>\n<p>her voice when she said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Kiss me again, Tom!—and be off with you to school, now, and don’t</p>\n<p>bother me any more.”</p>\n<p>The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a</p>\n<p>jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her</p>\n<p>hand, and said to herself:</p>\n<p>“No, I don’t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he’s lied about it—but it’s a</p>\n<p>blessed, blessed lie, there’s such a comfort come from it. I hope</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the Lord—I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such</p>\n<p>good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don’t want to find out it’s a</p>\n<p>lie. I won’t look.”</p>\n<p>She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out</p>\n<p>her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more</p>\n<p>she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:</p>\n<p>“It’s a good lie—it’s a good lie—I won’t let it grieve me.” So she</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom’s piece of</p>\n<p>bark through flowing tears and saying: “I could forgive the boy, now, if</p>\n<p>he’d committed a million sins!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>\n<p>There was something about Aunt Polly’s manner, when she kissed Tom, that</p>\n<p>swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He</p>\n<p>started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the</p>\n<p>head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a</p>\n<p>moment’s hesitation he ran to her and said:</p>\n<p>“I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I’m so sorry. I won’t ever, ever</p>\n<p>do that way again, as long as ever I live—please make up, won’t you?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:</p>\n<p>“I’ll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I’ll</p>\n<p>never speak to you again.”</p>\n<p>She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not</p>\n<p>even presence of mind enough to say “Who cares, Miss Smarty?” until the</p>\n<p>right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a</p>\n<p>fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently</p>\n<p>encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled</p>\n<p>one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in</p>\n<p>her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to “take in,”</p>\n<p>she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.</p>\n<p>If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom’s</p>\n<p>offensive fling had driven it entirely away.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.</p>\n<p>The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied</p>\n<p>ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but</p>\n<p>poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village</p>\n<p>schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and</p>\n<p>absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept</p>\n<p>that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy</p>\n<p>and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories</p>\n<p>were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.</p>\n<p>Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she</p>\n<p>noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She</p>\n<p>glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the</p>\n<p>book in her hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody’s _Anatomy_—carried</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at</p>\n<p>once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure,</p>\n<p>stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer</p>\n<p>stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky</p>\n<p>snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the</p>\n<p>pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,</p>\n<p>turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person</p>\n<p>and look at what they’re looking at.”</p>\n<p>“How could I know you was looking at anything?”</p>\n<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you’re</p>\n<p>going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I’ll be</p>\n<p>whipped, and I never was whipped in school.”</p>\n<p>Then she stamped her little foot and said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that’s going to happen.</p>\n<p>You just wait and you’ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!”—and she flung</p>\n<p>out of the house with a new explosion of crying.</p>\n<p>Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said</p>\n<p>to himself:</p>\n<p>“What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in</p>\n<p>school! Shucks! What’s a licking! That’s just like a girl—they’re so</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain’t going to tell</p>\n<p>old Dobbins on this little fool, because there’s other ways of getting</p>\n<p>even on her, that ain’t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask</p>\n<p>who it was tore his book. Nobody’ll answer. Then he’ll do just the way</p>\n<p>he always does—ask first one and then t’other, and when he comes to the</p>\n<p>right girl he’ll know it, without any telling. Girls’ faces always tell</p>\n<p>on them. They ain’t got any backbone. She’ll get licked. Well, it’s a</p>\n</div>",

In a few moments the</p>\n<p>master arrived and school “took in.” Tom did not feel a strong interest</p>\n<p>in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls’ side of the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>room Becky’s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want</p>\n<p>to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get</p>\n<p>up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the</p>\n<p>spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom’s mind was entirely full</p>\n<p>of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her</p>\n<p>lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She</p>\n<p>did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only</p>\n<p>seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad</p>\n<p>of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she</p>\n<p>was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse</p>\n<p>to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced</p>\n<p>herself to keep still—because, said she to herself, “he’ll tell about me</p>\n<p>tearing the picture sure. I wouldn’t say a word, not to save his life!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all</p>\n<p>broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly</p>\n<p>upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout—he</p>\n<p>had denied it for form’s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck</p>\n<p>to the denial from principle.</p>\n<p>A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air</p>\n<p>was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,</p>\n<p>but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the</p>\n<p>pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched</p>\n<p>his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently</p>\n<p>for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!</p>\n<p>Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit</p>\n<p>look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>his quarrel with her. Quick—something must be done! done in a flash,</p>\n<p>too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.</p>\n<p>Good!—he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring</p>\n<p>through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little</p>\n<p>instant, and the chance was lost—the master opened the volume. If Tom</p>\n<p>only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help</p>\n<p>for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even</p>\n<p>the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten—the</p>\n<p>master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: “Who tore this book?”</p>\n<p>There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness</p>\n<p>continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.</p>\n<p>“Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?”</p>\n<p>A denial. Another pause.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Joseph Harper, did you?”</p>\n<p>Another denial. Tom’s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the</p>\n<p>slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of</p>\n<p>boys—considered a while, then turned to the girls:</p>\n<p>“Amy Lawrence?”</p>\n<p>A shake of the head.</p>\n<p>“Gracie Miller?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The same sign.</p>\n<p>“Susan Harper, did you do this?”</p>\n<p>Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling</p>\n<p>from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the</p>\n<p>situation.</p>\n<p>“Rebecca Thatcher” [Tom glanced at her face—it was white with</p>\n<p>terror]—“did you tear—no, look me in the face” [her hands rose in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>appeal]—“did you tear this book?”</p>\n<p>A thought shot like lightning through Tom’s brain. He sprang to his feet</p>\n<p>and shouted—“I done it!”</p>\n<p>The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a</p>\n<p>moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward</p>\n<p>to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that</p>\n<p>shone upon him out of poor Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without</p>\n<p>an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever</p>\n<p>administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a</p>\n<p>command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed—for he</p>\n<p>knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not</p>\n<p>count the tedious time as loss, either.</p>\n<p>Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own</p>\n<p>treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to</p>\n<p>pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky’s latest words</p>\n<p>lingering dreamily in his ear—</p>\n<p>“Tom, how _could_ you be so noble!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>\n<p>Vacation was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer</p>\n<p>and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good</p>\n<p>showing on “Examination” day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle</p>\n<p>now—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young</p>\n<p>ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings</p>\n<p>were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a</p>\n<p>perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,</p>\n<p>all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a</p>\n<p>vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence</p>\n<p>was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and</p>\n<p>their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do</p>\n<p>the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution</p>\n<p>that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they</p>\n<p>conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.</p>\n<p>They swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his</p>\n<p>help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded</p>\n<p>in his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.</p>\n<p>The master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and</p>\n<p>there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and</p>\n<p>the signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper</p>\n<p>condition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he</p>\n<p>napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time</p>\n<p>and hurried away to school.</p>\n<p>In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in</p>\n<p>the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in</p>\n<p>his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.</p>\n<p>He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and</p>\n<p>six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town</p>\n<p>and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of</p>\n<p>citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the</p>\n<p>scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;</p>\n<p>rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in</p>\n<p>lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their</p>\n<p>grandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and</p>\n<p>the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with</p>\n<p>non-participating scholars.</p>\n<p>The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“You’d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,”</p>\n<p>etc.—accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic</p>\n<p>gestures which a machine might have used—supposing the machine to be a</p>\n<p>trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,</p>\n<p>and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and</p>\n<p>retired.</p>\n<p>A little shamefaced girl lisped, “Mary had a little lamb,” etc.,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and</p>\n<p>sat down flushed and happy.</p>\n<p>Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into</p>\n<p>the unquenchable and indestructible “Give me liberty or give me death”</p>\n<p>speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the</p>\n<p>middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under</p>\n<p>him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>house but he had the house’s silence, too, which was even worse than</p>\n<p>its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom</p>\n<p>struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak</p>\n<p>attempt at applause, but it died early.</p>\n<p>“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck” followed; also “The Assyrian Came</p>\n<p>Down,” and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,</p>\n<p>and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>prime feature of the evening was in order, now—original “compositions”</p>\n<p>by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the</p>\n<p>platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty</p>\n<p>ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression”</p>\n<p>and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon</p>\n<p>similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and</p>\n<p>doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in</p>\n<p>History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political</p>\n<p>Government Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart</p>\n<p>Longings,” etc., etc.</p>\n<p>A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted</p>\n<p>melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”;</p>\n<p>another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that</p>\n<p>conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable</p>\n<p>sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of</p>\n<p>them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was</p>\n<p>made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious</p>\n<p>mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of</p>\n<p>these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will</p>\n<p>be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all</p>\n<p>our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their</p>\n<p>compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the</p>\n<p>most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the</p>\n<p>longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely</p>\n<p>truth is unpalatable.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read</p>\n<p>was one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an</p>\n<p>extract from it:</p>\n<p>“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the</p>\n<p>youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!</p>\n<p>Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the</p>\n<p>voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>observed of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,</p>\n<p>is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,</p>\n<p>her step is lightest in the gay assembly.</p>\n<p>“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour</p>\n<p>arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has</p>\n<p>had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her</p>\n<p>enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is</p>\n<p>vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly</p>\n<p>upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health</p>\n<p>and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly</p>\n<p>pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”</p>\n<p>And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to</p>\n<p>time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed</p>\n<p>with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.</p>\n<p>Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting”</p>\n<p>paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two</p>\n<p>stanzas of it will do:</p>\n<p>“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA</p>\n<p>“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>But yet for a while do I leave thee now!</p>\n<p>Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,</p>\n<p>And burning recollections throng my brow!</p>\n<p>For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;</p>\n<p>Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream;</p>\n<p>Have listened to Tallassee’s warring floods,</p>\n<p>And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart,</p>\n<p>Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;</p>\n<p>’Tis from no stranger land I now must part,</p>\n<p>’Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.</p>\n<p>Welcome and home were mine within this State,</p>\n<p>Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me</p>\n<p>And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tête,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!”</p>\n<p>There were very few there who knew what “_tête_” meant, but the poem</p>\n<p>was very satisfactory, nevertheless.</p>\n<p>Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,</p>\n<p>who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began</p>\n<p>to read in a measured, solemn tone:</p>\n<p>A VISION</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single</p>\n<p>star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly</p>\n<p>vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry</p>\n<p>mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power</p>\n<p>exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous</p>\n<p>winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered</p>\n<p>about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit</p>\n<p>sighed; but instead thereof,</p>\n<p>‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide—</p>\n<p>My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side.</p>\n<p>She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks</p>\n<p>of fancy’s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned</p>\n<p>save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by</p>\n<p>her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided</p>\n<p>away unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features,</p>\n<p>like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the</p>\n<p>contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings</p>\n<p>presented.</p>\n<p>This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took</p>\n<p>the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest</p>\n<p>effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize</p>\n<p>to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by</p>\n<p>far the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel</p>\n<p>Webster himself might well be proud of it.</p>\n<p>It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to</p>\n<p>as “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.</p>\n<p>Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair</p>\n<p>aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of</p>\n<p>America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he</p>\n<p>made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter</p>\n<p>rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted</p>\n<p>them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his</p>\n<p>entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down</p>\n<p>by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined</p>\n<p>he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly</p>\n<p>increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with</p>\n<p>a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about</p>\n<p>her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she</p>\n<p>curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed</p>\n<p>at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was</p>\n<p>within six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, a little</p>\n<p>lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,</p>\n<p>and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master’s</p>\n<p>bald pate—for the signpainter’s boy had _gilded_ it!</p>\n<p>That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.</p>\n<p>[*] NOTE:—The pretended “compositions” quoted in this chapter are taken</p>\n<p>without alteration from a volume entitled “Prose and Poetry, by a</p>\n<p>Western Lady”—but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl</p>\n<p>pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>\n<p>Tom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the</p>\n<p>showy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking,</p>\n<p>chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out</p>\n<p>a new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way</p>\n<p>in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon</p>\n<p>found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire</p>\n<p>grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth</p>\n<p>of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had</p>\n<p>worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old</p>\n<p>Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed</p>\n<p>and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.</p>\n<p>During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition</p>\n<p>and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the</p>\n<p>looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.</p>\n<p>At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was</p>\n<p>disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation</p>\n<p>at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom</p>\n<p>resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.</p>\n<p>The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,</p>\n<p>however—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but</p>\n<p>found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he</p>\n<p>could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.</p>\n<p>Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning</p>\n<p>to hang a little heavily on his hands.</p>\n<p>He attempted a diary—but nothing happened during three days, and so he</p>\n</div>",

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>in the midst of this gossip.

It would be some</p>\n<p>relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of</p>\n<p>distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself</p>\n<p>that Huck had remained discreet.</p>\n<p>“Huck, have you ever told anybody about—that?”</p>\n<p>“’Bout what?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“You know what.”</p>\n<p>“Oh—’course I haven’t.”</p>\n<p>“Never a word?”</p>\n<p>“Never a solitary word, so help me.

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom felt more comfortable.

They ain’t no different way.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s all right, then. I reckon we’re safe as long as we keep</p>\n<p>mum. But let’s swear again, anyway.

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>So they swore again with dread solemnities.</p>\n<p>“What is the talk around, Huck?

It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so’s I want to hide som’ers.”</p>\n<p>“That’s just the same way they go on round me.

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Huck was having the same experience.

At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect</p>\n<p>that Injun Joe’s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>not the slightest question as to what the jury’s verdict would be.</p>\n<p>Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He</p>\n<p>was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to</p>\n<p>sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for</p>\n<p>this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented</p>\n<p>in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took</p>\n<p>their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all</p>\n<p>the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,</p>\n<p>stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and</p>\n<p>the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings</p>\n<p>among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These</p>\n<p>details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation</p>\n<p>that was as impressive as it was fascinating.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing</p>\n<p>in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was</p>\n<p>discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further</p>\n<p>questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:</p>\n<p>“Take the witness.”</p>\n<p>The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when</p>\n<p>his own counsel said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I have no questions to ask him.”</p>\n<p>The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.</p>\n<p>Counsel for the prosecution said:</p>\n<p>“Take the witness.”</p>\n<p>“I have no questions to ask him,” Potter’s lawyer replied.</p>\n<p>A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter’s</p>\n<p>possession.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Take the witness.”</p>\n<p>Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience</p>\n<p>began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his</p>\n<p>client’s life without an effort?</p>\n<p>Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter’s guilty behavior when</p>\n<p>brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand</p>\n<p>without being cross-questioned.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the</p>\n<p>graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was</p>\n<p>brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined</p>\n<p>by Potter’s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house</p>\n<p>expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.</p>\n<p>Counsel for the prosecution now said:</p>\n<p>“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the</p>\n<p>unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.”</p>\n<p>A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and</p>\n<p>rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned</p>\n<p>in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women’s compassion</p>\n<p>testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:</p>\n<p>“Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed</p>\n<p>while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced</p>\n<p>by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.” [Then</p>\n<p>to the clerk:] “Call Thomas Sawyer!”</p>\n<p>A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting</p>\n<p>Potter’s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as</p>\n<p>he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.</p>\n<p>“Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the</p>\n<p>hour of midnight?”</p>\n<p>Tom glanced at Injun Joe’s iron face and his tongue failed him. The</p>\n<p>audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few</p>\n<p>moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed</p>\n<p>to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“In the graveyard!”</p>\n<p>“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You were—”</p>\n<p>“In the graveyard.”</p>\n<p>A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s face.</p>\n<p>“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Speak up—just a trifle louder. How near were you?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Near as I am to you.”</p>\n<p>“Were you hidden, or not?”</p>\n<p>“I was hid.”</p>\n<p>“Where?”</p>\n<p>“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”</p>\n<p>Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.</p>\n<p>“Any one with you?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Yes, sir. I went there with—”</p>\n<p>“Wait—wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion’s name. We</p>\n<p>will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>Tom hesitated and looked confused.</p>\n<p>“Speak out, my boy—don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.</p>\n<p>What did you take there?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Only a—a—dead cat.”</p>\n<p>There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.</p>\n<p>“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us</p>\n<p>everything that occurred—tell it in your own way—don’t skip anything,</p>\n<p>and don’t be afraid.”</p>\n<p>Tom began—hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his</p>\n<p>words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and</p>\n<p>bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,</p>\n<p>rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent</p>\n<p>emotion reached its climax when the boy said:</p>\n<p>“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun</p>\n<p>Joe jumped with the knife and—”</p>\n<p>Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>way through all opposers, and was gone!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>\n<p>Tom was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the</p>\n<p>young.

Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always</p>\n<p>with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy</p>\n<p>to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of</p>\n<p>wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer</p>\n<p>the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding</p>\n<p>Injun Joe’s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.</p>\n<p>The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of</p>\n<p>that? Since Tom’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the</p>\n<p>lawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had</p>\n<p>been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck’s</p>\n<p>confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Daily Muff Potter’s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly</p>\n<p>he wished he had sealed up his tongue.</p>\n<p>Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the</p>\n<p>other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a</p>\n<p>safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.</p>\n<p>Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun</p>\n<p>Joe was found.

        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I don’t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha’nted house or on</p>\n<p>an island, or under a dead tree that’s got one limb sticking out. Well,</p>\n<p>we’ve tried Jackson’s Island a little, and we can try it again some</p>\n<p>time; and there’s the old ha’nted house up the Still-House branch, and</p>\n<p>there’s lots of dead-limb trees—dead loads of ’em.”</p>\n<p>“Is it under all of them?”</p>\n<p>“How you talk! No!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Then how you going to know which one to go for?”</p>\n<p>“Go for all of ’em!”</p>\n<p>“Why, Tom, it’ll take all summer.”</p>\n<p>“Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars</p>\n<p>in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di’monds. How’s</p>\n<p>that?”</p>\n<p>Huck’s eyes glowed.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“That’s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred</p>\n<p>dollars and I don’t want no di’monds.”</p>\n<p>“All right. But I bet you I ain’t going to throw off on di’monds. Some</p>\n<p>of ’em’s worth twenty dollars apiece—there ain’t any, hardly, but’s</p>\n<p>worth six bits or a dollar.”</p>\n<p>“No! Is that so?”</p>\n<p>“Cert’nly—anybody’ll tell you so. Hain’t you ever seen one, Huck?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Not as I remember.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, kings have slathers of them.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I don’ know no kings, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“I reckon you don’t. But if you was to go to Europe you’d see a raft of</p>\n<p>’em hopping around.”</p>\n<p>“Do they hop?”</p>\n<p>“Hop?—your granny! No!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, what did you say they did, for?”</p>\n<p>“Shucks, I only meant you’d _see_ ’em—not hopping, of course—what do</p>\n<p>they want to hop for?—but I mean you’d just see ’em—scattered around,</p>\n<p>you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.”</p>\n<p>“Richard? What’s his other name?”</p>\n<p>“He didn’t have any other name. Kings don’t have any but a given name.”</p>\n<p>“No?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“But they don’t.”</p>\n<p>“Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don’t want to be a king</p>\n<p>and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say—where you going</p>\n<p>to dig first?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I don’t know. S’pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the</p>\n<p>hill t’other side of Still-House branch?”</p>\n<p>“I’m agreed.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their</p>\n<p>three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves</p>\n<p>down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.</p>\n<p>“I like this,” said Tom.</p>\n<p>“So do I.”</p>\n<p>“Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your</p>\n<p>share?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, I’ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I’ll go to every</p>\n<p>circus that comes along. I bet I’ll have a gay time.”</p>\n<p>“Well, ain’t you going to save any of it?”</p>\n<p>“Save it? What for?”</p>\n<p>“Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that ain’t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day</p>\n<p>and get his claws on it if I didn’t hurry up, and I tell you he’d clean</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“I’m going to buy a new drum, and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie</p>\n<p>and a bull pup, and get married.”</p>\n<p>“Married!”</p>\n<p>“That’s it.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, you—why, you ain’t in your right mind.”</p>\n<p>“Wait—you’ll see.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, that’s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my</p>\n<p>mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty</p>\n<p>well.”</p>\n<p>“That ain’t anything. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all comb a body. Now you</p>\n<p>better think ’bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What’s the name</p>\n<p>of the gal?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“It ain’t a gal at all—it’s a girl.”</p>\n<p>“It’s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl—both’s</p>\n<p>right, like enough. Anyway, what’s her name, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“I’ll tell you some time—not now.”</p>\n<p>“All right—that’ll do. Only if you get married I’ll be more lonesomer</p>\n<p>than ever.”</p>\n<p>“No you won’t. You’ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>we’ll go to digging.”</p>\n<p>They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another</p>\n<p>halfhour. Still no result. Huck said:</p>\n<p>“Do they always bury it as deep as this?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes—not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven’t got the right</p>\n<p>place.”</p>\n<p>So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.</p>\n<p>Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his</p>\n<p>brow with his sleeve, and said:</p>\n<p>“Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?”</p>\n<p>“I reckon maybe we’ll tackle the old tree that’s over yonder on Cardiff</p>\n<p>Hill back of the widow’s.”</p>\n<p>“I reckon that’ll be a good one. But won’t the widow take it away from</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>us, Tom? It’s on her land.”</p>\n<p>“_She_ take it away! Maybe she’d like to try it once. Whoever finds one</p>\n<p>of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don’t make any difference</p>\n<p>whose land it’s on.”</p>\n<p>That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:</p>\n<p>“Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?”</p>\n<p>“It is mighty curious, Huck. I don’t understand it. Sometimes witches</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>interfere. I reckon maybe that’s what’s the trouble now.”</p>\n<p>“Shucks! Witches ain’t got no power in the daytime.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s so. I didn’t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!</p>\n<p>What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow</p>\n<p>of the limb falls at midnight, and that’s where you dig!”</p>\n<p>“Then consound it, we’ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang</p>\n<p>it all, we got to come back in the night. It’s an awful long way. Can</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>you get out?”</p>\n<p>“I bet I will. We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees</p>\n<p>these holes they’ll know in a minute what’s here and they’ll go for it.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ll come around and maow tonight.”</p>\n<p>“All right. Let’s hide the tools in the bushes.”</p>\n<p>The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in</p>\n<p>the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked</p>\n<p>in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the</p>\n<p>distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were</p>\n<p>subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged</p>\n<p>that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to</p>\n<p>dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and</p>\n<p>their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon</p>\n<p>something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone</p>\n<p>or a chunk. At last Tom said:</p>\n<p>“It ain’t any use, Huck, we’re wrong again.”</p>\n<p>“Well, but we _can’t_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”</p>\n<p>“I know it, but then there’s another thing.”</p>\n<p>“What’s that?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too</p>\n<p>early.”</p>\n<p>Huck dropped his shovel.</p>\n<p>“That’s it,” said he. “That’s the very trouble. We got to give this one</p>\n<p>up. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s</p>\n<p>too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering</p>\n<p>around so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time; and I’m</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for</p>\n<p>a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a</p>\n<p>dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.”</p>\n<p>“Lordy!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, they do. I’ve always heard that.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, I don’t like to fool around much where there’s dead people. A</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>body’s bound to get into trouble with ’em, sure.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t like to stir ’em up, either. S’pose this one here was to stick</p>\n<p>his skull out and say something!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t Tom! It’s awful.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it just is. Huck, I don’t feel comfortable a bit.”</p>\n<p>“Say, Tom, let’s give this place up, and try somewheres else.”</p>\n<p>“All right, I reckon we better.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“What’ll it be?”</p>\n<p>Tom considered awhile; and then said:</p>\n<p>“The ha’nted house. That’s it!”</p>\n<p>“Blame it, I don’t like ha’nted houses, Tom. Why, they’re a dern sight</p>\n<p>worse’n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don’t come</p>\n<p>sliding around in a shroud, when you ain’t noticing, and peep over your</p>\n<p>shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>couldn’t stand such a thing as that, Tom—nobody could.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don’t travel around only at night. They won’t</p>\n<p>hender us from digging there in the daytime.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s so. But you know mighty well people don’t go about that</p>\n<p>ha’nted house in the day nor the night.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been</p>\n<p>murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular</p>\n<p>ghosts.”</p>\n<p>“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,</p>\n<p>you can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.</p>\n<p>Becuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that’s so. But anyway they don’t come around in the daytime, so</p>\n<p>what’s the use of our being afeard?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so—but I</p>\n<p>reckon it’s taking chances.”</p>\n<p>They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the</p>\n<p>moonlit valley below them stood the “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated,</p>\n<p>its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the</p>\n<p>chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof</p>\n<p>caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the</p>\n<p>circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted</p>\n<p>house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that</p>\n<p>adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>\n<p>About noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come</p>\n<p>for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was</p>\n<p>measurably so, also—but suddenly said:</p>\n<p>“Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?”</p>\n<p>Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his</p>\n<p>eyes with a startled look in them—</p>\n<p>“My! I never once thought of it, Huck!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was</p>\n<p>Friday.”</p>\n<p>“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got into an</p>\n<p>awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”</p>\n<p>“_Might_! Better say we _would_! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but</p>\n<p>Friday ain’t.”</p>\n<p>“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon _you_ was the first that found it</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>out, Huck.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a</p>\n<p>rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”</p>\n<p>“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that</p>\n<p>there’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do</p>\n<p>you know Robin Hood, Huck?”</p>\n<p>“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”</p>\n<p>“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the</p>\n<p>best. He was a robber.”</p>\n<p>“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”</p>\n<p>“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>he never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em</p>\n<p>perfectly square.”</p>\n<p>“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”</p>\n<p>“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.</p>\n<p>They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in</p>\n<p>England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow</p>\n<p>and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“What’s a _yew_ bow?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that</p>\n<p>dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll</p>\n<p>play Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”</p>\n<p>“I’m agreed.”</p>\n<p>So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a</p>\n<p>yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>morrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink</p>\n<p>into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows</p>\n<p>of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff</p>\n<p>Hill.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.</p>\n<p>They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their</p>\n<p>last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down</p>\n<p>within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and</p>\n<p>turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this</p>\n<p>time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling</p>\n<p>that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the</p>\n<p>requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.</p>\n<p>When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,</p>\n<p>and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the</p>\n<p>place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they</p>\n<p>crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,</p>\n<p>floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,</p>\n<p>a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and</p>\n<p>abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,</p>\n<p>and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.</p>\n<p>In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the</p>\n<p>place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own</p>\n<p>boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.</p>\n<p>This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring</p>\n<p>each other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of</p>\n<p>decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the</p>\n<p>promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now</p>\n<p>and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when—</p>\n<p>“Sh!” said Tom.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” whispered Huck, blanching with fright.</p>\n<p>“Sh!... There!... Hear it?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Yes!... Oh, my! Let’s run!”</p>\n<p>“Keep still! Don’t you budge! They’re coming right toward the door.”</p>\n<p>The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to</p>\n<p>knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.</p>\n<p>“They’ve stopped.... No—coming.... Here they are. Don’t whisper another</p>\n<p>word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!”</p>\n<p>Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: “There’s the old deaf and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>dumb Spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately—never saw</p>\n<p>t’other man before.”</p>\n<p>“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant</p>\n<p>in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white</p>\n<p>whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore</p>\n<p>green goggles. When they came in, “t’other” was talking in a low voice;</p>\n<p>they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less</p>\n<p>guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:</p>\n<p>“No,” said he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t like it. It’s</p>\n<p>dangerous.”</p>\n<p>“Dangerous!” grunted the “deaf and dumb” Spaniard—to the vast surprise</p>\n<p>of the boys. “Milksop!”</p>\n<p>This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe’s! There was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>silence for some time. Then Joe said:</p>\n<p>“What’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing’s come of</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.</p>\n<p>’Twon’t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn’t succeed.”</p>\n<p>“Well, what’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody</p>\n<p>would suspicion us that saw us.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I know that. But there warn’t any other place as handy after that fool</p>\n<p>of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it</p>\n<p>warn’t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys</p>\n<p>playing over there on the hill right in full view.”</p>\n<p>“Those infernal boys” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,</p>\n<p>and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and</p>\n<p>concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>year.</p>\n<p>The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and</p>\n<p>thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:</p>\n<p>“Look here, lad—you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there</p>\n<p>till you hear from me. I’ll take the chances on dropping into this town</p>\n<p>just once more, for a look. We’ll do that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve</p>\n<p>spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>We’ll leg it together!”</p>\n<p>This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“I’m dead for sleep! It’s your turn to watch.”</p>\n<p>He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred</p>\n<p>him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to</p>\n<p>nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:</p>\n<p>“Now’s our chance—come!”</p>\n<p>Huck said:</p>\n<p>“I can’t—I’d die if they was to wake.”</p>\n<p>Tom urged—Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and</p>\n<p>started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak</p>\n<p>from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments</p>\n<p>till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;</p>\n<p>and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.</p>\n<p>Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon</p>\n<p>his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up with</p>\n<p>his foot and said:</p>\n<p>“Here! _You’re_ a watchman, ain’t you! All right, though—nothing’s</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>happened.”</p>\n<p>“My! have I been asleep?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What’ll we</p>\n<p>do with what little swag we’ve got left?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know—leave it here as we’ve always done, I reckon. No use to</p>\n<p>take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver’s</p>\n<p>something to carry.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well—all right—it won’t matter to come here once more.”</p>\n<p>“No—but I’d say come in the night as we used to do—it’s better.”</p>\n<p>“Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right</p>\n<p>chance at that job; accidents might happen; ’tain’t in such a very good</p>\n<p>place; we’ll just regularly bury it—and bury it deep.”</p>\n<p>“Good idea,” said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,</p>\n<p>raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself</p>\n<p>and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on</p>\n<p>his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.</p>\n<p>The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With</p>\n<p>gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!—the splendor of it was</p>\n<p>beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make</p>\n<p>half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>auspices—there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to</p>\n<p>dig. They nudged each other every moment—eloquent nudges and easily</p>\n<p>understood, for they simply meant—“Oh, but ain’t you glad _now_ we’re</p>\n<p>here!”</p>\n<p>Joe’s knife struck upon something.</p>\n<p>“Hello!” said he.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” said his comrade.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Half-rotten plank—no, it’s a box, I believe. Here—bear a hand and we’ll</p>\n<p>see what it’s here for. Never mind, I’ve broke a hole.”</p>\n<p>He reached his hand in and drew it out—</p>\n<p>“Man, it’s money!”</p>\n<p>The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys</p>\n<p>above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.</p>\n<p>Joe’s comrade said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“We’ll make quick work of this. There’s an old rusty pick over amongst</p>\n<p>the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace—I saw it a</p>\n<p>minute ago.”</p>\n<p>He ran and brought the boys’ pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the</p>\n<p>pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to</p>\n<p>himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was</p>\n<p>not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in</p>\n<p>blissful silence.</p>\n<p>“Pard, there’s thousands of dollars here,” said Injun Joe.</p>\n<p>“’Twas always said that Murrel’s gang used to be around here one</p>\n<p>summer,” the stranger observed.</p>\n<p>“I know it,” said Injun Joe; “and this looks like it, I should say.”</p>\n<p>“Now you won’t need to do that job.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The halfbreed frowned. Said he:</p>\n<p>“You don’t know me. Least you don’t know all about that thing. ’Tain’t</p>\n<p>robbery altogether—it’s _revenge_!” and a wicked light flamed in his</p>\n<p>eyes. “I’ll need your help in it. When it’s finished—then Texas. Go home</p>\n<p>to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.”</p>\n<p>“Well—if you say so; what’ll we do with this—bury it again?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! by the great Sachem, no!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>[Profound distress overhead.] I’d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh</p>\n<p>earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business</p>\n<p>has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on</p>\n<p>them? Who brought them here—and where are they gone? Have you heard</p>\n<p>anybody?—seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and</p>\n<p>see the ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We’ll take it to my</p>\n<p>den.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number</p>\n<p>One?”</p>\n<p>“No—Number Two—under the cross. The other place is bad—too common.”</p>\n<p>“All right. It’s nearly dark enough to start.”</p>\n<p>Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping</p>\n<p>out. Presently he said:</p>\n<p>“Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>upstairs?”</p>\n<p>The boys’ breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,</p>\n<p>halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The</p>\n<p>boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came</p>\n<p>creaking up the stairs—the intolerable distress of the situation woke</p>\n<p>the stricken resolution of the lads—they were about to spring for the</p>\n<p>closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself</p>\n<p>up cursing, and his comrade said:</p>\n<p>“Now what’s the use of all that? If it’s anybody, and they’re up there,</p>\n<p>let them _stay_ there—who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get</p>\n<p>into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes—and then</p>\n<p>let them follow us if they want to. I’m willing. In my opinion, whoever</p>\n<p>hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>devils or something. I’ll bet they’re running yet.”</p>\n<p>Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight</p>\n<p>was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening</p>\n<p>twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.</p>\n<p>Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them</p>\n<p>through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the</p>\n<p>townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much</p>\n<p>absorbed in hating themselves—hating the ill luck that made them take</p>\n<p>the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have</p>\n<p>suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait</p>\n<p>there till his “revenge” was satisfied, and then he would have had the</p>\n<p>misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the tools were ever brought there!</p>\n<p>They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to</p>\n<p>town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to</p>\n<p>“Number Two,” wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to</p>\n<p>Tom.</p>\n<p>“Revenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t!” said Huck, nearly fainting.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe</p>\n<p>that he might possibly mean somebody else—at least that he might at</p>\n<p>least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.</p>\n<p>Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company</p>\n<p>would be a palpable improvement, he thought.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>\n<p>The adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom’s dreams that night.</p>\n<p>Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times</p>\n<p>it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and</p>\n<p>wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay</p>\n<p>in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he</p>\n<p>noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away—somewhat as if</p>\n<p>they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There</p>\n<p>was one very strong argument in favor of this idea—namely, that the</p>\n<p>quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen</p>\n<p>as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of</p>\n<p>his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to</p>\n<p>“hundreds” and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that</p>\n<p>no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in</p>\n<p>actual money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure</p>\n<p>had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of</p>\n<p>real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.</p>\n<p>But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer</p>\n<p>under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found</p>\n<p>himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a</p>\n<p>hurried breakfast and go and find Huck.</p>\n<p>Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his</p>\n<p>feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck</p>\n<p>lead up to the subject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be</p>\n<p>proved to have been only a dream.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Huck!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Hello, yourself.”</p>\n<p>Silence, for a minute.</p>\n<p>“Tom, if we’d ’a’ left the blame tools at the dead tree, we’d ’a’ got</p>\n<p>the money. Oh, ain’t it awful!”</p>\n<p>“’Tain’t a dream, then, ’tain’t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.</p>\n<p>Dog’d if I don’t, Huck.”</p>\n<p>“What ain’t a dream?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.”</p>\n<p>“Dream! If them stairs hadn’t broke down you’d ’a’ seen how much dream</p>\n<p>it was! I’ve had dreams enough all night—with that patch-eyed Spanish</p>\n<p>devil going for me all through ’em—rot him!”</p>\n<p>“No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!”</p>\n<p>“Tom, we’ll never find him. A feller don’t have only one chance for such</p>\n<p>a pile—and that one’s lost. I’d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>anyway.”</p>\n<p>“Well, so’d I; but I’d like to see him, anyway—and track him out—to his</p>\n<p>Number Two.”</p>\n<p>“Number Two—yes, that’s it. I been thinking ’bout that. But I can’t make</p>\n<p>nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?”</p>\n<p>“I dono. It’s too deep. Say, Huck—maybe it’s the number of a house!”</p>\n<p>“Goody!... No, Tom, that ain’t it. If it is, it ain’t in this one-horse</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>town. They ain’t no numbers here.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s so. Lemme think a minute. Here—it’s the number of a</p>\n<p>room—in a tavern, you know!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s the trick! They ain’t only two taverns. We can find out</p>\n<p>quick.”</p>\n<p>“You stay here, Huck, till I come.”</p>\n<p>Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck’s company in public</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.</p>\n<p>2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.</p>\n<p>In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper’s</p>\n<p>young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody</p>\n<p>go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any</p>\n<p>particular reason for this state of things; had had some little</p>\n<p>curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “ha’nted”; had</p>\n<p>noticed that there was a light in there the night before.</p>\n<p>“That’s what I’ve found out, Huck. I reckon that’s the very No. 2 we’re</p>\n<p>after.”</p>\n<p>“I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?”</p>\n<p>“Lemme think.”</p>\n<p>Tom thought a long time. Then he said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I’ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out</p>\n<p>into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap</p>\n<p>of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and</p>\n<p>I’ll nip all of auntie’s, and the first dark night we’ll go there and</p>\n<p>try ’em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he</p>\n<p>was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get</p>\n<p>his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don’t go to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>that No. 2, that ain’t the place.”</p>\n<p>“Lordy, I don’t want to foller him by myself!”</p>\n<p>“Why, it’ll be night, sure. He mightn’t ever see you—and if he did,</p>\n<p>maybe he’d never think anything.”</p>\n<p>“Well, if it’s pretty dark I reckon I’ll track him. I dono—I dono. I’ll</p>\n<p>try.”</p>\n<p>“You bet I’ll follow him, if it’s dark, Huck. Why, he might ’a’ found</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>out he couldn’t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.”</p>\n<p>“It’s so, Tom, it’s so. I’ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!”</p>\n<p>“Now you’re _talking_! Don’t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won’t.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>\n<p>That night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about</p>\n<p>the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley</p>\n<p>at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or</p>\n<p>left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern</p>\n<p>door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the</p>\n<p>understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck</p>\n<p>was to come and “maow,” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to</p>\n<p>bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.</p>\n<p>Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday</p>\n<p>night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt’s</p>\n<p>old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the</p>\n<p>lantern in Huck’s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before</p>\n<p>midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the</p>\n<p>alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,</p>\n<p>the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of</p>\n<p>distant thunder.</p>\n<p>Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the</p>\n<p>towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.</p>\n<p>Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck’s spirits like a</p>\n<p>mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern—it</p>\n<p>would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive</p>\n<p>yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have</p>\n<p>fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and</p>\n<p>excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer</p>\n<p>and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away</p>\n<p>his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to</p>\n<p>inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the</p>\n<p>way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came</p>\n<p>tearing by him: “Run!” said he; “run, for your life!”</p>\n<p>He needn’t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or</p>\n<p>forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the</p>\n<p>lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm</p>\n<p>burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:</p>\n<p>“Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;</p>\n<p>but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn’t hardly</p>\n<p>get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn’t turn in the lock, either.</p>\n<p>Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>open comes the door! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the</p>\n<p>towel, and, _Great Caesar’s Ghost!_”</p>\n<p>“What!—what’d you see, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe’s hand!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>“Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch</p>\n<p>on his eye and his arms spread out.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?”</p>\n<p>“No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and</p>\n<p>started!”</p>\n<p>“I’d never ’a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”</p>\n<p>“Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”</p>\n<p>“Say, Tom, did you see that box?”</p>\n<p>“Huck, I didn’t wait to look around. I didn’t see the box, I didn’t see</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the cross. I didn’t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor</p>\n<p>by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.</p>\n<p>Don’t you see, now, what’s the matter with that ha’nted room?”</p>\n<p>“How?”</p>\n<p>“Why, it’s ha’nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have</p>\n<p>got a ha’nted room, hey, Huck?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I reckon maybe that’s so. Who’d ’a’ thought such a thing? But</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>say, Tom, now’s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe’s</p>\n<p>drunk.”</p>\n<p>“It is, that! You try it!”</p>\n<p>Huck shuddered.</p>\n<p>“Well, no—I reckon not.”</p>\n<p>“And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain’t</p>\n<p>enough. If there’d been three, he’d be drunk enough and I’d do it.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun</p>\n<p>Joe’s not in there. It’s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we’ll</p>\n<p>be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we’ll</p>\n<p>snatch that box quicker’n lightning.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m agreed. I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every</p>\n<p>night, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a</p>\n<p>block and maow—and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window</p>\n<p>and that’ll fetch me.”</p>\n<p>“Agreed, and good as wheat!”</p>\n<p>“Now, Huck, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be</p>\n<p>daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will</p>\n<p>you?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“I said I would, Tom, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for</p>\n<p>a year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”</p>\n<p>“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”</p>\n<p>“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man,</p>\n<p>Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any</p>\n<p>time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.</p>\n<p>That’s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>if I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat _with_ him. But</p>\n<p>you needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry</p>\n<p>he wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”</p>\n<p>“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t</p>\n<p>come bothering around. Any time you see something’s up, in the night,</p>\n<p>just skip right around and maow.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>\n<p>The first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of</p>\n<p>news—Judge Thatcher’s family had come back to town the night before.</p>\n<p>Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a</p>\n<p>moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her</p>\n<p>and they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”</p>\n<p>with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in</p>\n<p>a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she</p>\n<p>consented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more</p>\n<p>moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway</p>\n<p>the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation</p>\n<p>and pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep</p>\n<p>awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s</p>\n<p>“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.</p>\n<p>Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and</p>\n<p>rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was</p>\n<p>ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the</p>\n<p>picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough</p>\n<p>under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young</p>\n<p>gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main</p>\n<p>street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss</p>\n<p>the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.</p>\n<p>Thatcher said to Becky, was:</p>\n<p>“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with</p>\n<p>some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”</p>\n<p>Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:</p>\n<p>“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll</p>\n<p>climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have</p>\n<p>ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be</p>\n<p>awful glad to have us.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that will be fun!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Then Becky reflected a moment and said:</p>\n<p>“But what will mamma say?”</p>\n<p>“How’ll she ever know?”</p>\n<p>The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:</p>\n<p>“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”</p>\n<p>“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she</p>\n<p>wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”</p>\n<p>The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and</p>\n<p>Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say</p>\n<p>nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to</p>\n<p>Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The</p>\n<p>thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he</p>\n<p>could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so</p>\n<p>why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the</p>\n<p>evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined</p>\n<p>to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of</p>\n<p>the box of money another time that day.</p>\n<p>Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody</p>\n<p>hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and</p>\n<p>laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone</p>\n<p>through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified</p>\n<p>with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things</p>\n<p>began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in</p>\n<p>the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:</p>\n<p>“Who’s ready for the cave?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there</p>\n<p>was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the</p>\n<p>hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood</p>\n<p>unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled</p>\n<p>by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was</p>\n<p>romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out</p>\n<p>upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment</p>\n<p>a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a</p>\n<p>struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked</p>\n<p>down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a</p>\n<p>new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went</p>\n<p>filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of</p>\n<p>lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than</p>\n<p>eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower</p>\n<p>crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a</p>\n<p>vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again</p>\n<p>and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights</p>\n<p>together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never</p>\n<p>find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under</p>\n<p>labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was</p>\n<p>an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it</p>\n<p>was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer</p>\n<p>knew as much of the cave as any one.</p>\n<p>The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of</p>\n<p>a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise</p>\n<p>at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude</p>\n<p>each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the</p>\n<p>“known” ground.</p>\n<p>By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth</p>\n<p>of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow</p>\n<p>drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking</p>\n<p>no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had</p>\n<p>been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s</p>\n<p>adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat</p>\n<p>with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for</p>\n<p>the wasted time but the captain of the craft.</p>\n<p>Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young</p>\n<p>people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly</p>\n<p>tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not</p>\n<p>stop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his</p>\n<p>attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten</p>\n<p>o’clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began</p>\n<p>to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the</p>\n<p>silence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the tavern lights were</p>\n<p>put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long</p>\n<p>time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?</p>\n<p>Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?</p>\n<p>A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley</p>\n<p>door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under</p>\n<p>his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.</p>\n<p>Why call Tom now? It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box</p>\n<p>and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow</p>\n<p>them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So</p>\n<p>communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the</p>\n<p>men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>ahead not to be invisible.</p>\n<p>They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up</p>\n<p>a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the</p>\n<p>path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old</p>\n<p>Welshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still</p>\n<p>climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.</p>\n<p>But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and</p>\n<p>were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his</p>\n<p>distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along</p>\n<p>awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved</p>\n<p>on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that</p>\n<p>he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an</p>\n<p>owl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man</p>\n<p>cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his</p>\n<p>throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as</p>\n<p>if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he</p>\n<p>thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He</p>\n<p>knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’</p>\n<p>grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to find.</p>\n<p>Now there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe’s:</p>\n<p>“Damn her, maybe she’s got company—there’s lights, late as it is.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t see any.”</p>\n<p>This was that stranger’s voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A</p>\n<p>deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His</p>\n<p>thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder</p>\n<p>her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t</p>\n<p>dare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in</p>\n<p>the moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s</p>\n<p>next—which was—</p>\n<p>“Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and</p>\n<p>maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you</p>\n<p>before, I don’t care for her swag—you may have it. But her husband was</p>\n<p>rough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice</p>\n<p>of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t</p>\n<p>a millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!—horsewhipped in</p>\n<p>front of the jail, like a nigger!—with all the town looking on!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>_Horsewhipped_!—do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But</p>\n<p>I’ll take it out of _her_.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was</p>\n<p>here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t</p>\n<p>kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her</p>\n<p>ears like a sow!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“By God, that’s—”</p>\n<p>“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her</p>\n<p>to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if</p>\n<p>she does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for _my_ sake—that’s</p>\n<p>why you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you.</p>\n<p>Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and</p>\n<p>then I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the</p>\n<p>better—I’m all in a shiver.”</p>\n<p>“Do it _now_? And company there? Look here—I’ll get suspicious of you,</p>\n<p>first thing you know. No—we’ll wait till the lights are out—there’s no</p>\n<p>hurry.”</p>\n<p>Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful</p>\n<p>than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,</p>\n<p>one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one</p>\n<p>side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same</p>\n<p>elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and—a twig</p>\n<p>snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no</p>\n<p>sound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he</p>\n<p>turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—turned</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>himself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but</p>\n<p>cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and</p>\n<p>so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he</p>\n<p>reached the Welshman’s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads</p>\n<p>of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.</p>\n<p>“What’s the row there? Who’s banging? What do you want?”</p>\n<p>“Let me in—quick! I’ll tell everything.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Why, who are you?”</p>\n<p>“Huckleberry Finn—quick, let me in!”</p>\n<p>“Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain’t a name to open many doors, I judge!</p>\n<p>But let him in, lads, and let’s see what’s the trouble.”</p>\n<p>“Please don’t ever tell I told you,” were Huck’s first words when he got</p>\n<p>in. “Please don’t—I’d be killed, sure—but the widow’s been good friends</p>\n<p>to me sometimes, and I want to tell—I _will_ tell if you’ll promise you</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>won’t ever say it was me.”</p>\n<p>“By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn’t act so!”</p>\n<p>exclaimed the old man; “out with it and nobody here’ll ever tell, lad.”</p>\n<p>Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the</p>\n<p>hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in</p>\n<p>their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great</p>\n<p>bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXIX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.</p>\n<p>Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as</p>\n<p>fast as his legs could carry him.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX</h3>\n<p>As the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came</p>\n<p>groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s door. The</p>\n<p>inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,</p>\n<p>on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a</p>\n<p>window:</p>\n<p>“Who’s there!”</p>\n<p>Huck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”</p>\n<p>“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!”</p>\n<p>These were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest</p>\n<p>he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever</p>\n<p>been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he</p>\n<p>entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall</p>\n<p>sons speedily dressed themselves.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be</p>\n<p>ready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too—make</p>\n<p>yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop</p>\n<p>here last night.”</p>\n<p>“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols</p>\n<p>went off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted</p>\n<p>to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”</p>\n<p>“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it—but</p>\n<p>there’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they</p>\n<p>ain’t dead, lad—we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right</p>\n<p>where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along</p>\n<p>on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that</p>\n<p>sumach path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—’twas bound to</p>\n<p>come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when</p>\n<p>the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,</p>\n<p>I sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling</p>\n<p>was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and</p>\n<p>we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.</p>\n<p>They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet</p>\n<p>we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a</p>\n<p>posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it</p>\n<p>is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys</p>\n<p>will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of</p>\n<p>those rascals—’twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they</p>\n<p>were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”</p>\n<p>“Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!”</p>\n<p>“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or</p>\n<p>twice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged—”</p>\n<p>“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back</p>\n<p>of the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and</p>\n<p>tell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The Welshman’s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck</p>\n<p>sprang up and exclaimed:</p>\n<p>“Oh, please don’t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,</p>\n<p>please!”</p>\n<p>“All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what</p>\n<p>you did.”</p>\n<p>“Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:</p>\n<p>“They won’t tell—and I won’t. But why don’t you want it known?”</p>\n<p>Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too</p>\n<p>much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew</p>\n<p>anything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing</p>\n<p>it, sure.</p>\n<p>The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking</p>\n<p>suspicious?”</p>\n<p>Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:</p>\n<p>“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and</p>\n<p>I don’t see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account</p>\n<p>of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of</p>\n<p>doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>come along upstreet ’bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I</p>\n<p>got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed</p>\n<p>up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes</p>\n<p>these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their</p>\n<p>arm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one</p>\n<p>wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up</p>\n<p>their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a</p>\n<p>rusty, ragged-looking devil.”</p>\n<p>“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”</p>\n<p>This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:</p>\n<p>“Well, I don’t know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”</p>\n<p>“Then they went on, and you—”</p>\n<p>“Follered ’em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>along so. I dogged ’em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and</p>\n<p>heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d</p>\n<p>spile her looks just as I told you and your two—”</p>\n<p>“What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!”</p>\n<p>Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep</p>\n<p>the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,</p>\n<p>and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,</p>\n<p>but the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.</p>\n<p>Presently the Welshman said:</p>\n<p>“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for</p>\n<p>all the world. No—I’d protect you—I’d protect you. This Spaniard is</p>\n<p>not deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t</p>\n<p>cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>to keep dark. Now trust me—tell me what it is, and trust me—I won’t</p>\n<p>betray you.”</p>\n<p>Huck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and</p>\n<p>whispered in his ear:</p>\n<p>“’Tain’t a Spaniard—it’s Injun Joe!”</p>\n<p>The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:</p>\n<p>“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because</p>\n<p>white men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a</p>\n<p>different matter altogether.”</p>\n<p>During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man</p>\n<p>said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going</p>\n<p>to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for</p>\n<p>marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of—</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Of _what_?”</p>\n<p>If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more</p>\n<p>stunning suddenness from Huck’s blanched lips. His eyes were staring</p>\n<p>wide, now, and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman</p>\n<p>started—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied:</p>\n<p>“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the _matter_ with you?”</p>\n<p>Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said:</p>\n<p>“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what</p>\n<p>did give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we’d found?”</p>\n<p>Huck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have</p>\n<p>given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested</p>\n<p>itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless</p>\n<p>reply offered—there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>it—feebly:</p>\n<p>“Sunday-school books, maybe.”</p>\n<p>Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and</p>\n<p>joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and</p>\n<p>ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a man’s pocket, because</p>\n<p>it cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:</p>\n<p>“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>you’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it.</p>\n<p>Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”</p>\n<p>Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such</p>\n<p>a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel</p>\n<p>brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the</p>\n<p>talk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,</p>\n<p>however—he had not known that it wasn’t—and so the suggestion of a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole</p>\n<p>he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all</p>\n<p>question that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was</p>\n<p>at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be</p>\n<p>drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still</p>\n<p>in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and</p>\n<p>Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>interruption.</p>\n<p>Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck</p>\n<p>jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even</p>\n<p>remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and</p>\n<p>gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of</p>\n<p>citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news</p>\n<p>had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.</p>\n<p>“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more</p>\n<p>beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me</p>\n<p>to tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”</p>\n<p>Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the</p>\n<p>main matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his</p>\n<p>visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the</p>\n<p>widow said:</p>\n<p>“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that</p>\n<p>noise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”</p>\n<p>“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come</p>\n<p>again—they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of</p>\n<p>waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>at your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”</p>\n<p>More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple</p>\n<p>of hours more.</p>\n<p>There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody</p>\n<p>was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came</p>\n<p>that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the</p>\n<p>sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:</p>\n<p>“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired</p>\n<p>to death.”</p>\n<p>“Your Becky?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” with a startled look—“didn’t she stay with you last night?”</p>\n<p>“Why, no.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:</p>\n<p>“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy</p>\n<p>that’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last</p>\n<p>night—one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to</p>\n<p>settle with him.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.</p>\n<p>“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”</p>\n<p>“No’m.”</p>\n<p>“When did you see him last?”</p>\n<p>Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had</p>\n<p>stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding</p>\n<p>uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed</p>\n<p>whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;</p>\n<p>it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One</p>\n<p>young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!</p>\n<p>Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her</p>\n<p>hands.</p>\n<p>The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and</p>\n<p>the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant</p>\n<p>insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs</p>\n<p>were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half</p>\n<p>an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward</p>\n<p>the cave.</p>\n<p>All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They</p>\n<p>cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the</p>\n<p>tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at</p>\n<p>last, all the word that came was, “Send more candles—and send food.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher</p>\n<p>sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed</p>\n<p>no real cheer.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with</p>\n<p>candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck</p>\n<p>still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with</p>\n<p>fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came</p>\n<p>and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,</p>\n<p>because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s,</p>\n<p>and nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:</p>\n<p>“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off.</p>\n<p>He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his</p>\n<p>hands.”</p>\n<p>Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the</p>\n<p>village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the</p>\n<p>news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and</p>\n<p>crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered</p>\n<p>through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither</p>\n<p>and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their</p>\n<p>hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,</p>\n<p>far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY &</p>\n<p>TOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the</p>\n<p>ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever</p>\n<p>have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so</p>\n<p>precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the</p>\n<p>awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away</p>\n<p>speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst</p>\n<p>forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;</p>\n<p>it was only a searcher’s light.</p>\n<p>Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and</p>\n<p>the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.</p>\n<p>The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the</p>\n<p>Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the</p>\n<p>public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—dimly</p>\n<p>dreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance</p>\n<p>Tavern since he had been ill.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the widow.</p>\n<p>Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:</p>\n<p>“What? What was it?”</p>\n<p>“Liquor!—and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child—what a turn you</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>did give me!”</p>\n<p>“Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer</p>\n<p>that found it?”</p>\n<p>The widow burst into tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I’ve told you</p>\n<p>before, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!”</p>\n<p>Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great</p>\n<p>powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXX (cont.)</h3>\n<p>forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should</p>\n<p>cry.</p>\n<p>These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the</p>\n<p>weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:</p>\n<p>“There—he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody</p>\n<p>could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t many left, now, that’s got hope</p>\n<p>enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI</h3>\n<p>Now to return to Tom and Becky’s share in the picnic. They tripped along</p>\n<p>the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar</p>\n<p>wonders of the cave—wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,</p>\n<p>such as “The Drawing-Room,” “The Cathedral,” “Aladdin’s Palace,” and</p>\n<p>so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky</p>\n<p>engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle</p>\n<p>wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,</p>\n<p>postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been</p>\n<p>frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they</p>\n<p>scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls</p>\n<p>were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging</p>\n<p>shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream</p>\n<p>of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara</p>\n<p>in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind</p>\n<p>it in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification. He found that</p>\n<p>it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between</p>\n<p>narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.</p>\n<p>Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future</p>\n<p>guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and</p>\n<p>branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In</p>\n<p>one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a</p>\n<p>multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of</p>\n<p>a man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and</p>\n<p>presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into</p>\n<p>it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst</p>\n<p>of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which</p>\n<p>had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites</p>\n<p>together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the</p>\n<p>roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a</p>\n<p>bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by</p>\n<p>hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and</p>\n<p>hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for</p>\n<p>a bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out</p>\n<p>of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the</p>\n<p>fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got</p>\n<p>rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,</p>\n<p>which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would</p>\n<p>be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the</p>\n<p>deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the</p>\n<p>children. Becky said:</p>\n<p>“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of</p>\n<p>the others.”</p>\n<p>“Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them—and I don’t know how</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t hear</p>\n<p>them here.”</p>\n<p>Becky grew apprehensive.</p>\n<p>“I wonder how long we’ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”</p>\n<p>“Can you find the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”</p>\n<p>“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>out it will be an awful fix. Let’s try some other way, so as not to go</p>\n<p>through there.”</p>\n<p>“Well. But I hope we won’t get lost. It would be so awful!” and the girl</p>\n<p>shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.</p>\n<p>They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long</p>\n<p>way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar</p>\n<p>about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he</p>\n<p>would say cheerily:</p>\n<p>“Oh, it’s all right. This ain’t the one, but we’ll come to it right</p>\n<p>away!”</p>\n<p>But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began</p>\n<p>to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of</p>\n<p>finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was “all right,” but</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their</p>\n<p>ring and sounded just as if he had said, “All is lost!” Becky clung to</p>\n<p>his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,</p>\n<p>but they would come. At last she said:</p>\n<p>“Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let’s go back that way! We seem to get</p>\n<p>worse and worse off all the time.”</p>\n<p>“Listen!” said he.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were</p>\n<p>conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down</p>\n<p>the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that</p>\n<p>resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.</p>\n<p>“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,” said Becky.</p>\n<p>“It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,” and</p>\n<p>he shouted again.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The “might” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so</p>\n<p>confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but</p>\n<p>there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried</p>\n<p>his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his</p>\n<p>manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky—he could not find his way</p>\n<p>back!</p>\n<p>“Oh, Tom, you didn’t make any marks!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to</p>\n<p>come back! No—I can’t find the way. It’s all mixed up.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, Tom, we’re lost! we’re lost! We never can get out of this awful</p>\n<p>place! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!”</p>\n<p>She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom</p>\n<p>was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He</p>\n<p>sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing</p>\n<p>regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom</p>\n<p>begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell</p>\n<p>to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable</p>\n<p>situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope</p>\n<p>again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he</p>\n<p>would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>she said.</p>\n<p>So they moved on again—aimlessly—simply at random—all they could do</p>\n<p>was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of</p>\n<p>reviving—not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its</p>\n<p>nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and</p>\n<p>familiarity with failure.</p>\n<p>By-and-by Tom took Becky’s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.</p>\n<p>She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his</p>\n<p>pockets—yet he must economize.</p>\n<p>By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay</p>\n<p>attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was</p>\n<p>grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,</p>\n<p>was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>invite death and shorten its pursuit.</p>\n<p>At last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.</p>\n<p>Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,</p>\n<p>and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom</p>\n<p>tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements</p>\n<p>were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore</p>\n<p>so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural</p>\n<p>under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and</p>\n<p>rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing</p>\n<p>into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and</p>\n<p>dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a</p>\n<p>breezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan</p>\n<p>followed it.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I</p>\n<p>don’t, Tom! Don’t look so! I won’t say it again.”</p>\n<p>“I’m glad you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll feel rested, now, and we’ll find</p>\n<p>the way out.”</p>\n<p>“We can try, Tom; but I’ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I</p>\n<p>reckon we are going there.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let’s go on trying.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried</p>\n<p>to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was</p>\n<p>that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not</p>\n<p>be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this—they</p>\n<p>could not tell how long—Tom said they must go softly and listen for</p>\n<p>dripping water—they must find a spring. They found one presently, and</p>\n<p>Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to</p>\n<p>hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom</p>\n<p>fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought</p>\n<p>was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the</p>\n<p>silence:</p>\n<p>“Tom, I am so hungry!”</p>\n<p>Tom took something out of his pocket.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Do you remember this?” said he.</p>\n<p>Becky almost smiled.</p>\n<p>“It’s our wedding-cake, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Yes—I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it’s all we’ve got.”</p>\n<p>“I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup</p>\n<p>people do with wedding-cake—but it’ll be our—”</p>\n<p>She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was</p>\n<p>abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky</p>\n<p>suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?”</p>\n<p>Becky’s face paled, but she thought she could.</p>\n<p>“Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there’s water to drink.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>That little piece is our last candle!”</p>\n<p>Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort</p>\n<p>her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:</p>\n<p>“Tom!”</p>\n<p>“Well, Becky?”</p>\n<p>“They’ll miss us and hunt for us!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, they will! Certainly they will!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Maybe they’re hunting for us now, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.”</p>\n<p>“When would they miss us, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“When they get back to the boat, I reckon.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn’t come?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they</p>\n<p>got home.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>A frightened look in Becky’s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw</p>\n<p>that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!</p>\n<p>The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of</p>\n<p>grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers</p>\n<p>also—that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher</p>\n<p>discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper’s.</p>\n<p>The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone</p>\n<p>at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of</p>\n<p>smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then—the horror of utter darkness</p>\n<p>reigned!</p>\n<p>How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that</p>\n<p>she was crying in Tom’s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew</p>\n<p>was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said</p>\n<p>it might be Sunday, now—maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but</p>\n<p>her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that</p>\n<p>they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going</p>\n<p>on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in</p>\n<p>the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no</p>\n<p>more.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A</p>\n<p>portion of Tom’s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But</p>\n<p>they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted</p>\n<p>desire.</p>\n<p>By-and-by Tom said:</p>\n<p>“SH! Did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by</p>\n<p>the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently</p>\n<p>he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little</p>\n<p>nearer.</p>\n<p>“It’s them!” said Tom; “they’re coming! Come along, Becky—we’re all</p>\n<p>right now!”</p>\n<p>The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded</p>\n<p>against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three</p>\n<p>feet deep, it might be a hundred—there was no passing it at any rate.</p>\n<p>Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No</p>\n<p>bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They</p>\n<p>listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!</p>\n<p>a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He</p>\n<p>talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no</p>\n<p>sounds came again.</p>\n<p>The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged</p>\n<p>on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed</p>\n<p>it must be Tuesday by this time.</p>\n<p>Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the</p>\n<p>heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to</p>\n<p>a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the</p>\n<p>line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended</p>\n<p>in a “jumping-off place.” Tom got down on his knees and felt below,</p>\n<p>and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands</p>\n<p>conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding</p>\n<p>a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,</p>\n<p>and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun</p>\n<p>Joe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the</p>\n<p>next moment, to see the “Spaniard” take to his heels and get himself out</p>\n<p>of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come</p>\n<p>over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s</p>\n<p>fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he</p>\n<p>had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and</p>\n<p>nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He</p>\n<p>was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he</p>\n<p>had only shouted “for luck.”</p>\n<p>But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought</p>\n<p>changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed</p>\n<p>that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,</p>\n<p>and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another</p>\n<p>passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But</p>\n<p>Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be</p>\n<p>roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die—it would</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he</p>\n<p>chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak</p>\n<p>to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would</p>\n<p>stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.</p>\n<p>Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show</p>\n<p>of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;</p>\n<p>then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXI (cont.)</h3>\n<p>passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with</p>\n<p>bodings of coming doom.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII</h3>\n<p>Tuesday afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.</p>\n<p>Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public</p>\n<p>prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer</p>\n<p>that had the petitioner’s whole heart in it; but still no good news came</p>\n<p>from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest</p>\n<p>and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the</p>\n<p>children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her</p>\n<p>call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,</p>\n<p>then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into</p>\n<p>a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The</p>\n<p>village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.</p>\n<p>Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village</p>\n<p>bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>people, who shouted, “Turn out! turn out! they’re found! they’re found!”</p>\n<p>Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself</p>\n<p>and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage</p>\n<p>drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward</p>\n<p>march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after</p>\n<p>huzzah!</p>\n<p>The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour</p>\n<p>a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher’s house, seized</p>\n<p>the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, tried to</p>\n<p>speak but couldn’t—and drifted out raining tears all over the place.</p>\n<p>Aunt Polly’s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher’s nearly so. It</p>\n<p>would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the</p>\n<p>great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the</p>\n<p>wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it</p>\n<p>withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went</p>\n<p>on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his</p>\n<p>kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch</p>\n<p>of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off</p>\n<p>speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad</p>\n<p>Mississippi rolling by!</p>\n<p>And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that</p>\n<p>speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He</p>\n<p>told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told</p>\n<p>him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was</p>\n<p>going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to</p>\n<p>where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way</p>\n<p>out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried</p>\n<p>for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them</p>\n<p>and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men</p>\n<p>didn’t believe the wild tale at first, “because,” said they, “you are</p>\n<p>five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”—then took</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two</p>\n<p>or three hours after dark and then brought them home.</p>\n<p>Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him</p>\n<p>were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind</p>\n<p>them, and informed of the great news.</p>\n<p>Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to</p>\n<p>be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and</p>\n<p>more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,</p>\n<p>was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky</p>\n<p>did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had</p>\n<p>passed through a wasting illness.</p>\n<p>Tom learned of Huck’s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could</p>\n<p>not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his</p>\n<p>adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by</p>\n<p>to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;</p>\n<p>also that the “ragged man’s” body had eventually been found in the river</p>\n<p>near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,</p>\n<p>perhaps.</p>\n<p>About a fortnight after Tom’s rescue from the cave, he started off to</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting</p>\n<p>talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge</p>\n<p>Thatcher’s house was on Tom’s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The</p>\n<p>Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him</p>\n<p>ironically if he wouldn’t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he</p>\n<p>thought he wouldn’t mind it. The Judge said:</p>\n<p>“Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I’ve not the least doubt.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any</p>\n<p>more.”</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and</p>\n<p>triple-locked—and I’ve got the keys.”</p>\n<p>Tom turned as white as a sheet.</p>\n<p>“What’s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The water was brought and thrown into Tom’s face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, now you’re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Judge, Injun Joe’s in the cave!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>\n<p>Within a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of</p>\n<p>men were on their way to McDougal’s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled</p>\n<p>with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore</p>\n<p>Judge Thatcher.</p>\n<p>When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in</p>\n<p>the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,</p>\n<p>dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer</p>\n<p>of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own</p>\n<p>experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but</p>\n<p>nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,</p>\n<p>which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated</p>\n<p>before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day</p>\n<p>he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Injun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great</p>\n<p>foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with</p>\n<p>tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a</p>\n<p>sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought</p>\n<p>no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there</p>\n<p>had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless</p>\n<p>still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked</p>\n<p>that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary</p>\n<p>time—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could</p>\n<p>find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this</p>\n<p>vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now.

In one place, near at hand, a</p>\n<p>stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded</p>\n<p>by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off</p>\n<p>the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had</p>\n<p>scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once</p>\n<p>in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a</p>\n<p>dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours.

Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand</p>\n<p>years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it</p>\n<p>another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No</p>\n<p>matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped</p>\n<p>out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist</p>\n<p>stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when</p>\n<p>he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave.

Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would</p>\n<p>have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a</p>\n<p>pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired</p>\n<p>and leaky water-works.</p>\n<p>The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have</p>\n<p>an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom’s adventure from the</p>\n<p>Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted</p>\n<p>to talk about now. Huck’s face saddened. He said:</p>\n<p>“I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but</p>\n<p>whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must ’a’ ben</p>\n<p>you, soon as I heard ’bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you</p>\n<p>hadn’t got the money becuz you’d ’a’ got at me some way or other and</p>\n<p>told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>told me we’d never get holt of that swag.”</p>\n<p>“Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern</p>\n<p>was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don’t you remember you</p>\n<p>was to watch there that night?”</p>\n<p>“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a year ago. It was that very night that I</p>\n<p>follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”</p>\n<p>“_You_ followed him?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and</p>\n<p>I don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t</p>\n<p>ben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”</p>\n<p>Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only</p>\n<p>heard of the Welshman’s part of it before.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever</p>\n<p>nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>it’s a goner for us, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”</p>\n<p>“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on</p>\n<p>the track of that money again?”</p>\n<p>“Huck, it’s in the cave!”</p>\n<p>Huck’s eyes blazed.</p>\n<p>“Say it again, Tom.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“The money’s in the cave!”</p>\n<p>“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”</p>\n<p>“Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in</p>\n<p>there with me and help get it out?”</p>\n<p>“I bet I will! I will if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not</p>\n<p>get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>world.”</p>\n<p>“Good as wheat! What makes you think the money’s—”</p>\n<p>“Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don’t find it I’ll</p>\n<p>agree to give you my drum and every thing I’ve got in the world. I will,</p>\n<p>by jings.”</p>\n<p>“All right—it’s a whiz. When do you say?”</p>\n<p>“Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,</p>\n<p>now, but I can’t walk more’n a mile, Tom—least I don’t think I could.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,</p>\n<p>but there’s a mighty short cut that they don’t anybody but me know</p>\n<p>about. Huck, I’ll take you right to it in a skiff. I’ll float the skiff</p>\n<p>down there, and I’ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn’t ever</p>\n<p>turn your hand over.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Less start right off, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little</p>\n<p>bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled</p>\n<p>things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many’s the time I wished I</p>\n<p>had some when I was in there before.”</p>\n<p>A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who</p>\n<p>was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>below “Cave Hollow,” Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the</p>\n<p>cave hollow—no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see</p>\n<p>that white place up yonder where there’s been a landslide? Well, that’s</p>\n<p>one of my marks. We’ll get ashore, now.”</p>\n<p>They landed.</p>\n<p>“Now, Huck, where we’re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.”</p>\n<p>Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly</p>\n<p>marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:</p>\n<p>“Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it’s the snuggest hole in this country.</p>\n<p>You just keep mum about it. All along I’ve been wanting to be a robber,</p>\n<p>but I knew I’d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across</p>\n<p>it was the bother. We’ve got it now, and we’ll keep it quiet, only we’ll</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because of course there’s got to be a</p>\n<p>Gang, or else there wouldn’t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it</p>\n<p>sounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”</p>\n<p>“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that’s mostly the way.”</p>\n<p>“And kill them?”</p>\n<p>“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“What’s a ransom?”</p>\n<p>“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after</p>\n<p>you’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s</p>\n<p>the general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women,</p>\n<p>but you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully</p>\n<p>scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat</p>\n<p>off and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve</p>\n<p>been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that</p>\n<p>you couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right</p>\n<p>around and come back. It’s so in all the books.”</p>\n<p>“Why, it’s real bully, Tom. I believe it’s better’n to be a pirate.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s better in some ways, because it’s close to home and circuses</p>\n<p>and all that.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in</p>\n<p>the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then</p>\n<p>made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought</p>\n<p>them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.</p>\n<p>He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay</p>\n<p>against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame</p>\n<p>struggle and expire.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and</p>\n<p>gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently</p>\n<p>entered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the</p>\n<p>“jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not</p>\n<p>really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet</p>\n<p>high. Tom whispered:</p>\n<p>“Now I’ll show you something, Huck.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>He held his candle aloft and said:</p>\n<p>“Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There—on the</p>\n<p>big rock over yonder—done with candle-smoke.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, it’s a _cross_!”</p>\n<p>“_Now_ where’s your Number Two? ‘_under the cross_,’ hey? Right yonder’s</p>\n<p>where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!”</p>\n<p>Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Tom, less git out of here!”</p>\n<p>“What! and leave the treasure?”</p>\n<p>“Yes—leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost is round about there, certain.”</p>\n<p>“No it ain’t, Huck, no it ain’t. It would ha’nt the place where he</p>\n<p>died—away out at the mouth of the cave—five mile from here.”</p>\n<p>“No, Tom, it wouldn’t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of</p>\n<p>ghosts, and so do you.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind.</p>\n<p>But presently an idea occurred to him—</p>\n<p>“Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we’re making of ourselves! Injun Joe’s</p>\n<p>ghost ain’t a going to come around where there’s a cross!”</p>\n<p>The point was well taken. It had its effect.</p>\n<p>“Tom, I didn’t think of that. But that’s so. It’s luck for us, that</p>\n<p>cross is. I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.</p>\n<p>Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the</p>\n<p>great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.</p>\n<p>They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with</p>\n<p>a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some</p>\n<p>bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there</p>\n<p>was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>vain. Tom said:</p>\n<p>“He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the</p>\n<p>cross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the</p>\n<p>ground.”</p>\n<p>They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck</p>\n<p>could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:</p>\n<p>“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s</p>\n<p>that for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I’m going to dig in</p>\n<p>the clay.”</p>\n<p>“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.</p>\n<p>Tom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches</p>\n<p>before he struck wood.</p>\n<p>“Hey, Huck!—you hear that?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and</p>\n<p>removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.</p>\n<p>Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he</p>\n<p>could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed</p>\n<p>to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended</p>\n<p>gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to</p>\n<p>the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>exclaimed:</p>\n<p>“My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!”</p>\n<p>It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,</p>\n<p>along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two</p>\n<p>or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish</p>\n<p>well soaked with the water-drip.</p>\n<p>“Got it at last!” said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>his hand. “My, but we’re rich, Tom!”</p>\n<p>“Huck, I always reckoned we’d get it. It’s just too good to believe, but</p>\n<p>we _have_ got it, sure! Say—let’s not fool around here. Let’s snake it</p>\n<p>out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.”</p>\n<p>It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward</p>\n<p>fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.</p>\n<p>“I thought so,” he said; “_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>at the ha’nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of</p>\n<p>fetching the little bags along.”</p>\n<p>The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross</p>\n<p>rock.</p>\n<p>“Now less fetch the guns and things,” said Huck.</p>\n<p>“No, Huck—leave them there. They’re just the tricks to have when we</p>\n<p>go to robbing. We’ll keep them there all the time, and we’ll hold our</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>orgies there, too. It’s an awful snug place for orgies.”</p>\n<p>“What orgies?”</p>\n<p>“I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we’ve got to</p>\n<p>have them, too. Come along, Huck, we’ve been in here a long time. It’s</p>\n<p>getting late, I reckon. I’m hungry, too. We’ll eat and smoke when we get</p>\n<p>to the skiff.”</p>\n<p>They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the</p>\n<p>skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got</p>\n<p>under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting</p>\n<p>cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.</p>\n<p>“Now, Huck,” said Tom, “we’ll hide the money in the loft of the widow’s</p>\n<p>woodshed, and I’ll come up in the morning and we’ll count it and divide,</p>\n<p>and then we’ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook</p>\n<p>Benny Taylor’s little wagon; I won’t be gone a minute.”</p>\n<p>He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small</p>\n<p>sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,</p>\n<p>dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman’s</p>\n<p>house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the</p>\n<p>Welshman stepped out and said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Hallo, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>“Huck and Tom Sawyer.”</p>\n<p>“Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.</p>\n<p>Here—hurry up, trot ahead—I’ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it’s not as</p>\n<p>light as it might be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?”</p>\n<p>“Old metal,” said Tom.</p>\n<p>“I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>more time hunting up six bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry</p>\n<p>than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s</p>\n<p>human nature—hurry along, hurry along!”</p>\n<p>The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.</p>\n<p>“Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.”</p>\n<p>Huck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely</p>\n<p>accused:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.”</p>\n<p>The Welshman laughed.</p>\n<p>“Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy. I don’t know about that. Ain’t you</p>\n<p>and the widow good friends?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Well, she’s ben good friends to me, anyway.”</p>\n<p>“All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?”</p>\n<p>This question was not entirely answered in Huck’s slow mind before he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room.</p>\n<p>Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.</p>\n<p>The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence</p>\n<p>in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the</p>\n<p>Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great</p>\n<p>many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys</p>\n<p>as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson</p>\n<p>with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered</p>\n<p>half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:</p>\n<p>“Tom wasn’t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and</p>\n<p>Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”</p>\n<p>“And you did just right,” said the widow. “Come with me, boys.”</p>\n<p>She took them to a bedchamber and said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of</p>\n<p>clothes—shirts, socks, everything complete. They’re Huck’s—no, no</p>\n<p>thanks, Huck—Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they’ll fit both</p>\n<p>of you. Get into them. We’ll wait—come down when you are slicked up</p>\n<p>enough.”</p>\n<p>Then she left.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV</h3>\n<p>Huck said: “Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain’t</p>\n<p>high from the ground.”</p>\n<p>“Shucks! what do you want to slope for?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I ain’t used to that kind of a crowd. I can’t stand it. I ain’t</p>\n<p>going down there, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, bother! It ain’t anything. I don’t mind it a bit. I’ll take care of</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Sid appeared.</p>\n<p>“Tom,” said he, “auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.

Mr. Jones was bound</p>\n<p>Huck should be here—couldn’t get along with his grand secret without</p>\n<p>Huck, you know!”</p>\n<p>“Secret about what, Sid?”</p>\n<p>“About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow’s. I reckon Mr. Jones was</p>\n<p>going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop</p>\n<p>pretty flat.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.</p>\n<p>“Sid, was it you that told?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told—that’s enough.”</p>\n<p>“Sid, there’s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and</p>\n<p>that’s you. If you had been in Huck’s place you’d ’a’ sneaked down the</p>\n<p>hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can’t do any but mean</p>\n<p>things, and you can’t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>There—no thanks, as the widow says”—and Tom cuffed Sid’s ears and helped</p>\n<p>him to the door with several kicks. “Now go and tell auntie if you</p>\n<p>dare—and tomorrow you’ll catch it!”</p>\n<p>Some minutes later the widow’s guests were at the supper-table, and a</p>\n<p>dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,</p>\n<p>after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.</p>\n<p>Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was</p>\n<p>another person whose modesty—</p>\n<p>And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck’s share in</p>\n<p>the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the</p>\n<p>surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and</p>\n<p>effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,</p>\n<p>the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot</p>\n<p>the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely</p>\n<p>intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody’s gaze</p>\n<p>and everybody’s laudations.</p>\n<p>The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him</p>\n<p>educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in</p>\n<p>business in a modest way. Tom’s chance was come. He said:</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Huck don’t need it. Huck’s rich.”</p>\n<p>Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept</p>\n<p>back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But</p>\n<p>the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:</p>\n<p>“Huck’s got money. Maybe you don’t believe it, but he’s got lots of it.</p>\n<p>Oh, you needn’t smile—I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.”</p>\n<p>Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>interest—and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.</p>\n<p>“Sid, what ails Tom?” said Aunt Polly. “He—well, there ain’t ever any</p>\n<p>making of that boy out. I never—”</p>\n<p>Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly</p>\n<p>did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the</p>\n<p>table and said:</p>\n<p>“There—what did I tell you? Half of it’s Huck’s and half of it’s mine!”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for</p>\n<p>a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said</p>\n<p>he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of</p>\n<p>interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the</p>\n<p>charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:</p>\n<p>“I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it</p>\n<p>don’t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I’m</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>willing to allow.”</p>\n<p>The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand</p>\n<p>dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time</p>\n<p>before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably</p>\n<p>more than that in property.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV</h3>\n<p>The reader may rest satisfied that Tom’s and Huck’s windfall made a</p>\n<p>mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a</p>\n<p>sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked</p>\n<p>about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens</p>\n<p>tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every “haunted”</p>\n<p>house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,</p>\n<p>plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>treasure—and not by boys, but men—pretty grave, unromantic men, too,</p>\n<p>some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,</p>\n<p>stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had</p>\n<p>possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and</p>\n<p>repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as</p>\n<p>remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying</p>\n<p>commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper</p>\n<p>published biographical sketches of the boys.</p>\n<p>The Widow Douglas put Huck’s money out at six per cent., and Judge</p>\n<p>Thatcher did the same with Tom’s at Aunt Polly’s request. Each lad had</p>\n<p>an income, now, that was simply prodigious—a dollar for every weekday in</p>\n<p>the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got—no,</p>\n<p>it was what he was promised—he generally couldn’t collect it. A dollar</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old</p>\n<p>simple days—and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.</p>\n<p>Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no</p>\n<p>commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When</p>\n<p>Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her</p>\n<p>whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded</p>\n<p>grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine</p>\n<p>outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie—a lie that</p>\n<p>was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to</p>\n<p>breast with George Washington’s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky</p>\n<p>thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he</p>\n<p>walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight</p>\n<p>off and told Tom about it.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some</p>\n<p>day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the</p>\n<p>National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school</p>\n<p>in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or</p>\n<p>both.</p>\n<p>Huck Finn’s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas’</p>\n<p>protection introduced him into society—no, dragged him into it, hurled</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>him into it—and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The</p>\n<p>widow’s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they</p>\n<p>bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot</p>\n<p>or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had</p>\n<p>to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;</p>\n<p>he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so</p>\n<p>properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him</p>\n<p>hand and foot.</p>\n<p>He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up</p>\n<p>missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in</p>\n<p>great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high</p>\n<p>and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning</p>\n<p>Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.</p>\n<p>Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and</p>\n<p>ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was</p>\n<p>unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made</p>\n<p>him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him</p>\n<p>out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.</p>\n<p>Huck’s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Don’t talk about it, Tom. I’ve tried it, and it don’t work; it don’t</p>\n<p>work, Tom. It ain’t for me; I ain’t used to it. The widder’s good to me,</p>\n<p>and friendly; but I can’t stand them ways. She makes me get up just</p>\n<p>at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all</p>\n<p>to thunder; she won’t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them</p>\n<p>blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don’t seem to any air</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>git through ’em, somehow; and they’re so rotten nice that I can’t</p>\n<p>set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher’s; I hain’t slid on a</p>\n<p>cellar-door for—well, it ’pears to be years; I got to go to church</p>\n<p>and sweat and sweat—I hate them ornery sermons! I can’t ketch a fly in</p>\n<p>there, I can’t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by</p>\n<p>a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell—everything’s so</p>\n<p>awful reg’lar a body can’t stand it.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, everybody does that way, Huck.”</p>\n<p>“Tom, it don’t make no difference. I ain’t everybody, and I can’t</p>\n<p>_stand_ it. It’s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy—I don’t</p>\n<p>take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;</p>\n<p>I got to ask to go in a-swimming—dern’d if I hain’t got to ask to do</p>\n<p>everything. Well, I’d got to talk so nice it wasn’t no comfort—I’d got</p>\n<p>to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>in my mouth, or I’d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn’t let me smoke;</p>\n<p>she wouldn’t let me yell, she wouldn’t let me gape, nor stretch, nor</p>\n<p>scratch, before folks—” [Then with a spasm of special irritation and</p>\n<p>injury]—“And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a</p>\n<p>woman! I _had_ to shove, Tom—I just had to. And besides, that school’s</p>\n<p>going to open, and I’d a had to go to it—well, I wouldn’t stand _that_,</p>\n<p>Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain’t what it’s cracked up to be. It’s</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead</p>\n<p>all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar’l suits me, and</p>\n<p>I ain’t ever going to shake ’em any more. Tom, I wouldn’t ever got into</p>\n<p>all this trouble if it hadn’t ’a’ been for that money; now you just take</p>\n<p>my sheer of it along with your’n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes—not</p>\n<p>many times, becuz I don’t give a dern for a thing ’thout it’s tollable</p>\n<p>hard to git—and you go and beg off for me with the widder.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Oh, Huck, you know I can’t do that. ’Tain’t fair; and besides if you’ll</p>\n<p>try this thing just a while longer you’ll come to like it.”</p>\n<p>“Like it! Yes—the way I’d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long</p>\n<p>enough. No, Tom, I won’t be rich, and I won’t live in them cussed</p>\n<p>smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and</p>\n<p>I’ll stick to ’em, too. Blame it all! just as we’d got guns, and a cave,</p>\n<p>and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>and spile it all!”</p>\n<p>Tom saw his opportunity—</p>\n<p>“Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain’t going to keep me back from turning</p>\n<p>robber.”</p>\n<p>“No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?”</p>\n<p>“Just as dead earnest as I’m sitting here. But Huck, we can’t let you</p>\n<p>into the gang if you ain’t respectable, you know.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>Huck’s joy was quenched.</p>\n<p>“Can’t let me in, Tom? Didn’t you let me go for a pirate?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but that’s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a</p>\n<p>pirate is—as a general thing. In most countries they’re awful high up in</p>\n<p>the nobility—dukes and such.”</p>\n<p>“Now, Tom, hain’t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn’t shet me</p>\n<p>out, would you, Tom? You wouldn’t do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Huck, I wouldn’t want to, and I _don’t_ want to—but what would people</p>\n<p>say? Why, they’d say, ‘Mph! Tom Sawyer’s Gang! pretty low characters in</p>\n<p>it!’ They’d mean you, Huck. You wouldn’t like that, and I wouldn’t.”</p>\n<p>Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I</p>\n<p>can come to stand it, if you’ll let me b’long to the gang, Tom.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“All right, Huck, it’s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I’ll ask the</p>\n<p>widow to let up on you a little, Huck.”</p>\n<p>“Will you, Tom—now will you? That’s good. If she’ll let up on some of</p>\n<p>the roughest things, I’ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd</p>\n<p>through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, right off. We’ll get the boys together and have the initiation</p>\n<p>tonight, maybe.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Have the which?”</p>\n<p>“Have the initiation.”</p>\n<p>“What’s that?”</p>\n<p>“It’s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang’s</p>\n<p>secrets, even if you’re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and</p>\n<p>all his family that hurts one of the gang.”</p>\n<p>“That’s gay—that’s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.”</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>“Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing’s got to be done at midnight,</p>\n<p>in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find—a ha’nted house is the</p>\n<p>best, but they’re all ripped up now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, midnight’s good, anyway, Tom.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, so it is. And you’ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with</p>\n<p>blood.”</p>\n<p>“Now, that’s something _like_! Why, it’s a million times bullier than</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>pirating. I’ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be</p>\n<p>a reg’lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking ’bout it, I reckon</p>\n<p>she’ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.”</p>\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>So endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it</p>\n<p>must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the</p>\n<p>history of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='text-align: center;'>\n<h3>CHAPTER XXXV (cont.)</h3>\n<p>exactly where to stop—that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of</p>\n<p>juveniles, he must stop where he best can.</p>\n<p>Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are</p>\n<p>prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the</p>\n<p>story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they</p>\n<p>turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that</p>\n<p>part of their lives at present.</p>\n</div>"
