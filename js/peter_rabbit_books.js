        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>FREDERICK WARNE</p>\n<p>First published 1902</p>\n<p>Frederick Warne & Co., 1902</p>\n<p>Printed and bound in Great Britain by William Clowes Limited, Beccles</p>\n<p>and London</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names</p>\n<p>were--</p>\n<p>Flopsy,</p>\n<p>Mopsy,</p>\n<p>Cotton-tail,</p>\n<p>and Peter.</p>\n<p>They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>very big fir-tree.</p>\n<p>'Now my dears,' said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, 'you may go into</p>\n<p>the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden:</p>\n<p>your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs.</p>\n<p>McGregor.'</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>'Now run along, and don't get into mischief.</p>\n<p>I am going out.'</p>\n<p>Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through</p>\n<p>the wood to the baker's.</p>\n<p>She bought a loaf of brown bread and five</p>\n<p>currant buns.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went</p>\n<p>down the lane to gather blackberries:</p>\n<p>But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's</p>\n<p>garden, and squeezed under the gate!</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate</p>\n<p>some radishes;</p>\n<p>And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr.</p>\n<p>McGregor!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages,</p>\n<p>but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out,</p>\n<p>'Stop thief!'</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden,</p>\n<p>for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe</p>\n<p>amongst the potatoes.</p>\n<p>After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I</p>\n<p>think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately</p>\n<p>run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his</p>\n<p>jacket.</p>\n<p>It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were</p>\n<p>overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great</p>\n<p>excitement, and implored him to exert himself.</p>\n<p>Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the</p>\n<p>top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>behind him.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>And rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can.</p>\n<p>It would have</p>\n<p>been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.</p>\n<p>Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.</p>\n<p>He began to turn</p>\n<p>them over carefully, looking under each.</p>\n<p>Presently Peter sneezed--'Kertyschoo!' Mr. McGregor was after him in</p>\n<p>no time.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window,</p>\n<p>upsetting three plants.</p>\n<p>The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and</p>\n<p>he was tired of running after Peter.</p>\n<p>He went back to his work.</p>\n<p>Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with</p>\n<p>fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>Also he was</p>\n<p>very damp with sitting in that can.</p>\n<p>After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not</p>\n<p>very fast, and looking all round.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.</p>\n<p>An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying</p>\n<p>peas and beans to her family in the wood.</p>\n<p>Peter asked her the way to</p>\n<p>the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not</p>\n<p>answer.</p>\n<p>She only shook her head at him.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>Peter began to cry.</p>\n<p>Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he</p>\n<p>became more and more puzzled.</p>\n<p>Presently, he came to a pond where Mr.</p>\n<p>McGregor filled his water-cans.</p>\n<p>A white cat was staring at some</p>\n<p>gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>tail twitched as if it were alive.</p>\n<p>Peter thought it best to go away</p>\n<p>without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin,</p>\n<p>little Benjamin Bunny.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him,</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.</p>\n<p>Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.</p>\n<p>But presently, as nothing</p>\n<p>happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over.</p>\n<p>The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions.</p>\n<p>His back was</p>\n<p>turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running</p>\n<p>as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some</p>\n<p>black-currant bushes.</p>\n<p>Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not</p>\n<p>care.</p>\n<p>He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood</p>\n<p>outside the garden.</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow</p>\n<p>to frighten the blackbirds.</p>\n<p>Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to</p>\n<p>the big fir-tree.</p>\n<p>He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes.</p>\n<p>His mother was busy</p>\n<p>cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.</p>\n<p>It was the</p>\n<p>second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a</p>\n<p>fortnight!</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.</p>\n<p>His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a</p>\n<p>dose of it to Peter!</p>\n<p>'One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<p>But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and</p>\n</div>",
        "<div style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6;'>\n<p>blackberries for supper.</p>\n<p>THE END</p>\n</div>"
