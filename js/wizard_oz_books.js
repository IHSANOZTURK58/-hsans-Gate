        "<p>happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.</p>\n<p>Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be</p>\n<p>classed as “historical” in the children’s library; for the time has</p>\n<p>come for a series of newer “wonder tales” in which the stereotyped</p>\n<p>genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible</p>\n<p>and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a</p>\n<p>fearsome moral to each tale.</p>\n",
        "<p>Modern education includes morality;</p>\n<p>therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales</p>\n<p>and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.</p>\n<p>Having this thought in mind, the story of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”</p>\n<p>was written solely to please children of today.</p>\n<p>It aspires to being a</p>\n<p>modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and</p>\n",
        "<p>the heartaches and nightmares are left out.</p>\n<p>L.</p>\n<p>Frank Baum</p>\n<p>Chicago, April, 1900.</p>\n<p>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</p>\n<p>Chapter I</p>\n<p>The Cyclone</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle</p>\n<p>Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife.</p>\n<p>Their</p>\n<p>house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon</p>\n<p>many miles.</p>\n<p>There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one</p>\n<p>room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for</p>\n",
        "<p>the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.</p>\n<p>Uncle Henry</p>\n<p>and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in</p>\n<p>another corner.</p>\n<p>There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a</p>\n<p>small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family</p>\n<p>could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to</p>\n",
        "<p>crush any building in its path.</p>\n<p>It was reached by a trap door in the</p>\n<p>middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark</p>\n<p>hole.</p>\n<p>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see</p>\n<p>nothing but the great gray prairie on every side.</p>\n<p>Not a tree nor a</p>\n",
        "<p>house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of</p>\n<p>the sky in all directions.</p>\n<p>The sun had baked the plowed land into a</p>\n<p>gray mass, with little cracks running through it.</p>\n<p>Even the grass was</p>\n<p>not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until</p>\n<p>they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.</p>\n",
        "<p>Once the house had</p>\n<p>been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it</p>\n<p>away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.</p>\n<p>When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.</p>\n<p>The sun</p>\n<p>and wind had changed her, too.</p>\n<p>They had taken the sparkle from her eyes</p>\n",
        "<p>and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and</p>\n<p>lips, and they were gray also.</p>\n<p>She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled</p>\n<p>now.</p>\n<p>When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had</p>\n<p>been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and</p>\n<p>press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached</p>\n",
        "<p>her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she</p>\n<p>could find anything to laugh at.</p>\n<p>Uncle Henry never laughed.</p>\n<p>He worked hard from morning till night and</p>\n<p>did not know what joy was.</p>\n<p>He was gray also, from his long beard to his</p>\n<p>rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray</p>\n<p>as her other surroundings.</p>\n<p>Toto was not gray; he was a little black</p>\n<p>dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on</p>\n<p>either side of his funny, wee nose.</p>\n<p>Toto played all day long, and</p>\n<p>Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.</p>\n",
        "<p>Today, however, they were not playing.</p>\n<p>Uncle Henry sat upon the</p>\n<p>doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than</p>\n<p>usual.</p>\n<p>Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at</p>\n<p>the sky too.</p>\n<p>Aunt Em was washing the dishes.</p>\n",
        "<p>From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry</p>\n<p>and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the</p>\n<p>coming storm.</p>\n<p>There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the</p>\n<p>south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the</p>\n<p>grass coming from that direction also.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.</p>\n",
        "<p>“There’s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife.</p>\n<p>“I’ll go look</p>\n<p>after the stock.” Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and</p>\n<p>horses were kept.</p>\n<p>Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.</p>\n<p>One glance told her of</p>\n<p>the danger close at hand.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed.</p>\n<p>“Run for the cellar!”</p>\n<p>Toto jumped out of Dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl</p>\n<p>started to get him.</p>\n<p>Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door</p>\n<p>in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole.</p>\n<p>Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt.</p>\n",
        "<p>When she</p>\n<p>was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind,</p>\n<p>and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down</p>\n<p>suddenly upon the floor.</p>\n<p>Then a strange thing happened.</p>\n<p>The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the</p>\n<p>air.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.</p>\n<p>The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the</p>\n<p>exact center of the cyclone.</p>\n<p>In the middle of a cyclone the air is</p>\n<p>generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of</p>\n<p>the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top</p>\n<p>of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles</p>\n",
        "<p>away as easily as you could carry a feather.</p>\n<p>It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy</p>\n<p>found she was riding quite easily.</p>\n<p>After the first few whirls around,</p>\n<p>and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were</p>\n<p>being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.</p>\n<p>Toto did not like it.</p>\n",
        "<p>He ran about the room, now here, now there,</p>\n<p>barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to</p>\n<p>see what would happen.</p>\n<p>Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first</p>\n<p>the little girl thought she had lost him.</p>\n<p>But soon she saw one of his</p>\n<p>ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air</p>\n",
        "<p>was keeping him up so that he could not fall.</p>\n<p>She crept to the hole,</p>\n<p>caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward</p>\n<p>closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.</p>\n<p>Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;</p>\n<p>but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about</p>\n<p>her that she nearly became deaf.</p>\n",
        "<p>At first she had wondered if she would</p>\n<p>be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed</p>\n<p>and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to</p>\n<p>wait calmly and see what the future would bring.</p>\n<p>At last she crawled</p>\n<p>over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto</p>\n<p>followed and lay down beside her.</p>\n",
        "<p>In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,</p>\n<p>Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>Chapter II</p>\n<p>The Council with the Munchkins</p>\n<p>She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had</p>\n<p>not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt.</p>\n<p>As it was, the</p>\n",
        "<p>jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto</p>\n<p>put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally.</p>\n<p>Dorothy sat</p>\n<p>up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the</p>\n<p>bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes</p>\n<p>growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.</p>\n<p>The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the</p>\n<p>midst of a country of marvelous beauty.</p>\n<p>There were lovely patches of</p>\n<p>greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious</p>\n<p>fruits.</p>\n",
        "<p>Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with</p>\n<p>rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.</p>\n<p>A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between</p>\n<p>green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl</p>\n<p>who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.</p>\n<p>While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,</p>\n<p>she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had</p>\n",
        "<p>ever seen.</p>\n<p>They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been</p>\n<p>used to; but neither were they very small.</p>\n<p>In fact, they seemed about</p>\n<p>as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although</p>\n<p>they were, so far as looks go, many years older.</p>\n<p>Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed.</p>\n",
        "<p>They wore</p>\n<p>round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with</p>\n<p>little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>hats of the men were blue; the little woman’s hat was white, and she</p>\n<p>wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders.</p>\n<p>Over it were</p>\n",
        "<p>sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds.</p>\n<p>The men</p>\n<p>were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore</p>\n<p>well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops.</p>\n<p>The men,</p>\n<p>Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had</p>\n<p>beards.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the little woman was doubtless much older.</p>\n<p>Her face was</p>\n<p>covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather</p>\n<p>stiffly.</p>\n<p>When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the</p>\n<p>doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to</p>\n<p>come farther.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low</p>\n<p>bow and said, in a sweet voice:</p>\n<p>“You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.</p>\n<p>We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the</p>\n<p>East, and for setting our people free from bondage.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder.</p>\n<p>What could the little</p>\n",
        "<p>woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had</p>\n<p>killed the Wicked Witch of the East?</p>\n<p>Dorothy was an innocent, harmless</p>\n<p>little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;</p>\n<p>and she had never killed anything in all her life.</p>\n<p>But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,</p>\n<p>with hesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake.</p>\n",
        "<p>I</p>\n<p>have not killed anything.”</p>\n<p>“Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh,</p>\n<p>“and that is the same thing.</p>\n<p>See!” she continued, pointing to the</p>\n<p>corner of the house.</p>\n<p>“There are her two feet, still sticking out from</p>\n",
        "<p>under a block of wood.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright.</p>\n<p>There, indeed, just</p>\n<p>under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were</p>\n<p>sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.</p>\n<p>“Oh, dear!</p>\n<p>Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in</p>\n",
        "<p>dismay.</p>\n<p>“The house must have fallen on her.</p>\n<p>Whatever shall we do?”</p>\n<p>“There is nothing to be done,” said the little woman calmly.</p>\n<p>“But who was she?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,” answered the little</p>\n<p>woman.</p>\n",
        "<p>“She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,</p>\n<p>making them slave for her night and day.</p>\n<p>Now they are all set free, and</p>\n<p>are grateful to you for the favor.”</p>\n<p>“Who are the Munchkins?” inquired Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked</p>\n<p>Witch ruled.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Are you a Munchkin?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.</p>\n<p>When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift</p>\n<p>messenger to me, and I came at once.</p>\n<p>I am the Witch of the North.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, gracious!” cried Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Are you a real witch?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered the little woman.</p>\n<p>“But I am a good witch, and</p>\n<p>the people love me.</p>\n<p>I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who</p>\n<p>ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.”</p>\n<p>“But I thought all witches were wicked,” said the girl, who was half</p>\n<p>frightened at facing a real witch.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh, no, that is a great mistake.</p>\n<p>There were only four witches in all</p>\n<p>the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the</p>\n<p>South, are good witches.</p>\n<p>I know this is true, for I am one of them</p>\n<p>myself, and cannot be mistaken.</p>\n<p>Those who dwelt in the East and the</p>\n",
        "<p>West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of</p>\n<p>them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz—the one who</p>\n<p>lives in the West.”</p>\n<p>“But,” said Dorothy, after a moment’s thought, “Aunt Em has told me</p>\n<p>that the witches were all dead—years and years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Who is Aunt Em?” inquired the little old woman.</p>\n<p>“She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed</p>\n<p>and her eyes upon the ground.</p>\n<p>Then she looked up and said, “I do not</p>\n<p>know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned</p>\n<p>before.</p>\n<p>But tell me, is it a civilized country?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Then that accounts for it.</p>\n<p>In the civilized countries I believe there</p>\n<p>are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians.</p>\n<p>But,</p>\n<p>you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off</p>\n<p>from all the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Therefore we still have witches and</p>\n",
        "<p>wizards amongst us.”</p>\n<p>“Who are the wizards?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Oz himself is the Great Wizard,” answered the Witch, sinking her voice</p>\n<p>to a whisper.</p>\n<p>“He is more powerful than all the rest of us together.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>lives in the City of Emeralds.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,</p>\n<p>who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the</p>\n<p>corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to</p>\n<p>laugh.</p>\n<p>The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing</p>\n<p>was left but the silver shoes.</p>\n",
        "<p>“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up</p>\n<p>quickly in the sun.</p>\n<p>That is the end of her.</p>\n<p>But the silver shoes are</p>\n<p>yours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up</p>\n<p>the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to</p>\n<p>Dorothy.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one of</p>\n<p>the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what</p>\n<p>it is we never knew.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.</p>\n<p>Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:</p>\n<p>“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will</p>\n<p>worry about me.</p>\n",
        "<p>Can you help me find my way?”</p>\n<p>The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at</p>\n<p>Dorothy, and then shook their heads.</p>\n<p>“At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a great desert,</p>\n<p>and none could live to cross it.”</p>\n<p>“It is the same at the South,” said another, “for I have been there and</p>\n<p>seen it.</p>\n",
        "<p>The South is the country of the Quadlings.”</p>\n<p>“I am told,” said the third man, “that it is the same at the West.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of</p>\n<p>the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.”</p>\n<p>“The North is my home,” said the old lady, “and at its edge is the same</p>\n<p>great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz.</p>\n",
        "<p>I’m afraid, my dear, you</p>\n<p>will have to live with us.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these</p>\n<p>strange people.</p>\n<p>Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,</p>\n<p>for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep</p>\n<p>also.</p>\n",
        "<p>As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced</p>\n<p>the point on the end of her nose, while she counted “One, two, three”</p>\n<p>in a solemn voice.</p>\n<p>At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was</p>\n<p>written in big, white chalk marks:</p>\n<p>“LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS”</p>\n<p>The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the</p>\n",
        "<p>words on it, asked, “Is your name Dorothy, my dear?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.</p>\n<p>“Then you must go to the City of Emeralds.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Oz will help you.”</p>\n<p>“Where is this city?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the</p>\n<p>Great Wizard I told you of.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously.</p>\n<p>“He is a good Wizard.</p>\n<p>Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I</p>\n<p>have never seen him.”</p>\n<p>“How can I get there?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“You must walk.</p>\n<p>It is a long journey, through a country that is</p>\n",
        "<p>sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible.</p>\n<p>However, I will use</p>\n<p>all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.”</p>\n<p>“Won’t you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon</p>\n<p>the little old woman as her only friend.</p>\n<p>“No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you my kiss, and</p>\n<p>no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of</p>\n",
        "<p>the North.”</p>\n<p>She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead.</p>\n<p>Where</p>\n<p>her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy</p>\n<p>found out soon after.</p>\n<p>“The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” said the</p>\n<p>Witch, “so you cannot miss it.</p>\n",
        "<p>When you get to Oz do not be afraid of</p>\n<p>him, but tell your story and ask him to help you.</p>\n<p>Good-bye, my dear.”</p>\n<p>The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,</p>\n<p>after which they walked away through the trees.</p>\n<p>The Witch gave Dorothy</p>\n<p>a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and</p>\n",
        "<p>straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who</p>\n<p>barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been</p>\n<p>afraid even to growl while she stood by.</p>\n<p>But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear</p>\n<p>in just that way, and was not surprised in the least.</p>\n<p>Chapter III</p>\n<p>How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow</p>\n",
        "<p>When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry.</p>\n<p>So she went to</p>\n<p>the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.</p>\n<p>She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it</p>\n<p>down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.</p>\n<p>Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting</p>\n<p>there.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging</p>\n<p>from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what</p>\n<p>she wanted to help out her breakfast.</p>\n<p>Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to</p>\n<p>a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for</p>\n<p>the journey to the City of Emeralds.</p>\n<p>Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was</p>\n",
        "<p>hanging on a peg beside her bed.</p>\n<p>It was gingham, with checks of white</p>\n<p>and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,</p>\n<p>it was still a pretty frock.</p>\n<p>The girl washed herself carefully, dressed</p>\n<p>herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.</p>\n<p>She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,</p>\n",
        "<p>laying a white cloth over the top.</p>\n<p>Then she looked down at her feet and</p>\n<p>noticed how old and worn her shoes were.</p>\n<p>“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his</p>\n<p>tail to show he knew what she meant.</p>\n",
        "<p>At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had</p>\n<p>belonged to the Witch of the East.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto.</p>\n<p>“They would be just</p>\n<p>the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”</p>\n<p>She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which</p>\n<p>fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.</p>\n",
        "<p>Finally she picked up her basket.</p>\n<p>“Come along, Toto,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We will go to the Emerald City and ask</p>\n<p>the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.”</p>\n<p>She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket</p>\n<p>of her dress.</p>\n<p>And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she</p>\n",
        "<p>started on her journey.</p>\n<p>There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find</p>\n<p>the one paved with yellow bricks.</p>\n<p>Within a short time she was walking</p>\n<p>briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on</p>\n<p>the hard, yellow road-bed.</p>\n<p>The sun shone bright and the birds sang</p>\n",
        "<p>sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a</p>\n<p>little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own</p>\n<p>country and set down in the midst of a strange land.</p>\n<p>She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country</p>\n<p>was about her.</p>\n<p>There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted</p>\n<p>a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and</p>\n",
        "<p>vegetables in abundance.</p>\n<p>Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and</p>\n<p>able to raise large crops.</p>\n<p>Once in a while she would pass a house, and</p>\n<p>the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for</p>\n<p>everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and</p>\n<p>setting them free from bondage.</p>\n",
        "<p>The houses of the Munchkins were</p>\n<p>odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.</p>\n<p>All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the</p>\n<p>favorite color.</p>\n<p>Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to</p>\n<p>wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather</p>\n<p>larger than the rest.</p>\n",
        "<p>On the green lawn before it many men and women</p>\n<p>were dancing.</p>\n<p>Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and</p>\n<p>the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was</p>\n<p>loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other</p>\n<p>good things to eat.</p>\n<p>The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to</p>\n",
        "<p>pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest</p>\n<p>Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to</p>\n<p>celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.</p>\n<p>Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin</p>\n<p>himself, whose name was Boq.</p>\n<p>Then she sat upon a settee and watched the</p>\n<p>people dance.</p>\n",
        "<p>When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, “You must be a great sorceress.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” asked the girl.</p>\n<p>“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.</p>\n<p>Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses</p>\n<p>wear white.”</p>\n<p>“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out the</p>\n<p>wrinkles in it.</p>\n",
        "<p>“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq.</p>\n<p>“Blue is the color of the</p>\n<p>Munchkins, and white is the witch color.</p>\n<p>So we know you are a friendly</p>\n<p>witch.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to</p>\n<p>think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary</p>\n",
        "<p>little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange</p>\n<p>land.</p>\n<p>When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,</p>\n<p>where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it.</p>\n<p>The sheets were made</p>\n<p>of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with</p>\n<p>Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.</p>\n",
        "<p>She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played</p>\n<p>with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that</p>\n<p>greatly amused Dorothy.</p>\n<p>Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,</p>\n<p>for they had never seen a dog before.</p>\n<p>“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.</p>\n<p>“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there.</p>\n",
        "<p>It</p>\n<p>is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business</p>\n<p>with him.</p>\n<p>But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take</p>\n<p>you many days.</p>\n<p>The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass</p>\n<p>through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your</p>\n",
        "<p>journey.”</p>\n<p>This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz</p>\n<p>could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn</p>\n<p>back.</p>\n<p>She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of</p>\n<p>yellow brick.</p>\n<p>When she had gone several miles she thought she would</p>\n",
        "<p>stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road</p>\n<p>and sat down.</p>\n<p>There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far</p>\n<p>away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from</p>\n<p>the ripe corn.</p>\n<p>Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,</p>\n<p>nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face.</p>\n<p>An old, pointed blue</p>\n<p>hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and</p>\n<p>the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,</p>\n<p>which had also been stuffed with straw.</p>\n<p>On the feet were some old boots</p>\n",
        "<p>with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure</p>\n<p>was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its</p>\n<p>back.</p>\n<p>While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.</p>\n<p>She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the</p>\n<p>scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its</p>\n",
        "<p>head to her in a friendly way.</p>\n<p>Then she climbed down from the fence and</p>\n<p>walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.</p>\n<p>“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.</p>\n<p>“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.</p>\n<p>“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“How do you do?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely.</p>\n<p>“How do you</p>\n<p>do?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is</p>\n<p>very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“No, for this pole is stuck up my back.</p>\n",
        "<p>If you will please take away</p>\n<p>the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,</p>\n<p>being stuffed with straw, it was quite light.</p>\n<p>“Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on</p>\n<p>the ground.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a new man.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man</p>\n<p>speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.</p>\n<p>“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and</p>\n<p>yawned.</p>\n<p>“And where are you going?”</p>\n<p>“My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to the Emerald</p>\n<p>City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Where is the Emerald City?” he inquired.</p>\n<p>“And who is Oz?”</p>\n<p>“Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise.</p>\n<p>“No, indeed.</p>\n<p>I don’t know anything.</p>\n<p>You see, I am stuffed, so I have no</p>\n<p>brains at all,” he answered sadly.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh,” said Dorothy, “I’m awfully sorry for you.”</p>\n<p>“Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City with you, that</p>\n<p>Oz would give me some brains?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot tell,” she returned, “but you may come with me, if you like.</p>\n<p>If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you</p>\n<p>are now.”</p>\n<p>“That is true,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You see,” he continued</p>\n<p>confidentially, “I don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,</p>\n<p>because I cannot get hurt.</p>\n<p>If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin</p>\n<p>into me, it doesn’t matter, for I can’t feel it.</p>\n<p>But I do not want</p>\n<p>people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw</p>\n",
        "<p>instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?”</p>\n<p>“I understand how you feel,” said the little girl, who was truly sorry</p>\n<p>for him.</p>\n<p>“If you will come with me I’ll ask Oz to do all he can for</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” he answered gratefully.</p>\n<p>They walked back to the road.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy helped him over the fence, and</p>\n<p>they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.</p>\n<p>Toto did not like this addition to the party at first.</p>\n<p>He smelled</p>\n<p>around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats</p>\n<p>in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Don’t mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend.</p>\n<p>“He never bites.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’m not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“He can’t hurt the straw.</p>\n<p>Do let me carry that basket for you.</p>\n<p>I shall not mind it, for I can’t</p>\n<p>get tired.</p>\n",
        "<p>I’ll tell you a secret,” he continued, as he walked along.</p>\n<p>“There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.”</p>\n<p>“What is that?” asked Dorothy; “the Munchkin farmer who made you?”</p>\n<p>“No,” answered the Scarecrow; “it’s a lighted match.”</p>\n<p>Chapter IV</p>\n<p>The Road Through the Forest</p>\n<p>After a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so</p>\n",
        "<p>difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,</p>\n<p>which were here very uneven.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or</p>\n<p>missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy</p>\n<p>walked around.</p>\n<p>As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked</p>\n<p>straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length</p>\n",
        "<p>on the hard bricks.</p>\n<p>It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick</p>\n<p>him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing</p>\n<p>merrily at his own mishap.</p>\n<p>The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther</p>\n<p>back.</p>\n<p>There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther</p>\n",
        "<p>they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.</p>\n<p>At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy</p>\n<p>opened her basket and got out some bread.</p>\n<p>She offered a piece to the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow, but he refused.</p>\n<p>“I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my</p>\n<p>mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat,</p>\n",
        "<p>the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the</p>\n<p>shape of my head.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on</p>\n<p>eating her bread.</p>\n<p>“Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,” said</p>\n<p>the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner.</p>\n<p>So she told him all</p>\n",
        "<p>about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone</p>\n<p>had carried her to this queer Land of Oz.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, “I cannot understand why</p>\n<p>you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry,</p>\n<p>gray place you call Kansas.”</p>\n<p>“That is because you have no brains” answered the girl.</p>\n<p>“No matter how</p>\n",
        "<p>dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would</p>\n<p>rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful.</p>\n<p>There is no place like home.”</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow sighed.</p>\n<p>“Of course I cannot understand it,” he said.</p>\n<p>“If your heads were</p>\n<p>stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the</p>\n",
        "<p>beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all.</p>\n<p>It is</p>\n<p>fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.”</p>\n<p>“Won’t you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked the child.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:</p>\n<p>“My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever.</p>\n<p>I was</p>\n",
        "<p>only made day before yesterday.</p>\n<p>What happened in the world before that</p>\n<p>time is all unknown to me.</p>\n<p>Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one</p>\n<p>of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what</p>\n<p>was going on.</p>\n<p>There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing</p>\n",
        "<p>I heard was the farmer saying, ‘How do you like those ears?’</p>\n<p>“‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other.</p>\n<p>“‘Never mind,’” said the farmer.</p>\n<p>“‘They are ears just the same,’” which</p>\n<p>was true enough.</p>\n<p>“‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer.</p>\n<p>So he painted my right</p>\n",
        "<p>eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and</p>\n<p>at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my</p>\n<p>first glimpse of the world.</p>\n<p>“‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked the Munchkin who was watching</p>\n<p>the farmer.</p>\n<p>“‘Blue paint is just the color for eyes.’</p>\n<p>“‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’” said the farmer.</p>\n",
        "<p>And</p>\n<p>when the second eye was done I could see much better than before.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>he made my nose and my mouth.</p>\n<p>But I did not speak, because at that time</p>\n<p>I didn’t know what a mouth was for.</p>\n<p>I had the fun of watching them make</p>\n",
        "<p>my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at</p>\n<p>last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as</p>\n<p>anyone.</p>\n<p>“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer.</p>\n<p>‘He</p>\n<p>looks just like a man.’</p>\n<p>“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with him.</p>\n",
        "<p>The</p>\n<p>farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a</p>\n<p>tall stick, where you found me.</p>\n<p>He and his friend soon after walked</p>\n<p>away and left me alone.</p>\n<p>“I did not like to be deserted this way.</p>\n<p>So I tried to walk after them.</p>\n",
        "<p>But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on</p>\n<p>that pole.</p>\n<p>It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,</p>\n<p>having been made such a little while before.</p>\n<p>Many crows and other birds</p>\n<p>flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away</p>\n<p>again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel</p>\n",
        "<p>that I was quite an important person.</p>\n<p>By and by an old crow flew near</p>\n<p>me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n<p>“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner.</p>\n<p>Any</p>\n<p>crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.’ Then he</p>\n",
        "<p>hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted.</p>\n<p>The other birds,</p>\n<p>seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short</p>\n<p>time there was a great flock of them about me.</p>\n<p>“I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow</p>\n<p>after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had</p>\n<p>brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a</p>\n",
        "<p>better man than some of them.</p>\n<p>Brains are the only things worth having</p>\n<p>in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.’</p>\n<p>“After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try</p>\n<p>hard to get some brains.</p>\n<p>By good luck you came along and pulled me off</p>\n<p>the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me</p>\n",
        "<p>brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.”</p>\n<p>“I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxious to have</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“It is such an</p>\n<p>uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed the basket to the</p>\n",
        "<p>Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough</p>\n<p>and untilled.</p>\n<p>Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the</p>\n<p>trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the</p>\n<p>road of yellow brick.</p>\n<p>It was almost dark under the trees, for the</p>\n",
        "<p>branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and</p>\n<p>went on into the forest.</p>\n<p>“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as</p>\n<p>the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever</p>\n<p>it leads us.”</p>\n<p>“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“If it</p>\n<p>required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.”</p>\n<p>After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves</p>\n<p>stumbling along in the darkness.</p>\n<p>Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto</p>\n<p>could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow</p>\n<p>declared he could see as well as by day.</p>\n",
        "<p>So she took hold of his arm</p>\n<p>and managed to get along fairly well.</p>\n<p>“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,” she</p>\n<p>said, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the</p>\n<p>dark.”</p>\n<p>Soon after the Scarecrow stopped.</p>\n<p>“I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “built of logs</p>\n",
        "<p>and branches.</p>\n<p>Shall we go there?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered the child.</p>\n<p>“I am all tired out.”</p>\n<p>So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the</p>\n<p>cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one</p>\n<p>corner.</p>\n",
        "<p>She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a</p>\n<p>sound sleep.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another</p>\n<p>corner and waited patiently until morning came.</p>\n<p>Chapter V</p>\n<p>The Rescue of the Tin Woodman</p>\n<p>When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had</p>\n",
        "<p>long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels.</p>\n<p>She sat up and</p>\n<p>looked around her.</p>\n<p>There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in</p>\n<p>his corner, waiting for her.</p>\n<p>“We must go and search for water,” she said to him.</p>\n<p>“Why do you want water?” he asked.</p>\n",
        "<p>“To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the</p>\n<p>dry bread will not stick in my throat.”</p>\n<p>“It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,” said the Scarecrow</p>\n<p>thoughtfully, “for you must sleep, and eat and drink.</p>\n<p>However, you have</p>\n<p>brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.”</p>\n<p>They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a</p>\n",
        "<p>little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate</p>\n<p>her breakfast.</p>\n<p>She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and</p>\n<p>the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for</p>\n<p>there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.</p>\n<p>When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of</p>\n<p>yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What was that?” she asked timidly.</p>\n<p>“I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go and see.”</p>\n<p>Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to</p>\n<p>come from behind them.</p>\n<p>They turned and walked through the forest a few</p>\n<p>steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine</p>\n<p>that fell between the trees.</p>\n",
        "<p>She ran to the place and then stopped</p>\n<p>short, with a little cry of surprise.</p>\n<p>One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing</p>\n<p>beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely</p>\n<p>of tin.</p>\n<p>His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he</p>\n<p>stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while</p>\n<p>Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his</p>\n<p>teeth.</p>\n<p>“Did you groan?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did.</p>\n<p>I’ve been groaning for more than a</p>\n<p>year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved by the</p>\n<p>sad voice in which the man spoke.</p>\n<p>“Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered.</p>\n<p>“They are rusted so</p>\n<p>badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon</p>\n<p>be all right again.</p>\n<p>You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then</p>\n<p>she returned and asked anxiously, “Where are your joints?”</p>\n<p>“Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>So she oiled it, and as</p>\n<p>it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and</p>\n<p>moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the</p>\n<p>man could turn it himself.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said.</p>\n<p>And Dorothy oiled them and</p>\n<p>the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust</p>\n<p>and as good as new.</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which</p>\n<p>he leaned against the tree.</p>\n<p>“This is a great comfort,” he said.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I have been holding that axe in</p>\n<p>the air ever since I rusted, and I’m glad to be able to put it down at</p>\n<p>last.</p>\n<p>Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right</p>\n<p>once more.”</p>\n<p>So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked</p>\n<p>them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite</p>\n",
        "<p>creature, and very grateful.</p>\n<p>“I might have stood there always if you had not come along,” he said;</p>\n<p>“so you have certainly saved my life.</p>\n<p>How did you happen to be here?”</p>\n<p>“We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,” she</p>\n<p>answered, “and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.”</p>\n<p>“Why do you wish to see Oz?” he asked.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to</p>\n<p>put a few brains into his head,” she replied.</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment.</p>\n<p>Then he said:</p>\n<p>“Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?”</p>\n<p>“Why, I guess so,” Dorothy answered.</p>\n<p>“It would be as easy as to give</p>\n",
        "<p>the Scarecrow brains.”</p>\n<p>“True,” the Tin Woodman returned.</p>\n<p>“So, if you will allow me to join</p>\n<p>your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.”</p>\n<p>“Come along,” said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she</p>\n<p>would be pleased to have his company.</p>\n<p>So the Tin Woodman shouldered his</p>\n",
        "<p>axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road</p>\n<p>that was paved with yellow brick.</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.</p>\n<p>“For,” he said, “if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I</p>\n<p>would need the oil-can badly.”</p>\n<p>It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for</p>\n<p>soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place</p>\n",
        "<p>where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the</p>\n<p>travelers could not pass.</p>\n<p>But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe</p>\n<p>and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire</p>\n<p>party.</p>\n<p>Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not</p>\n<p>notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the</p>\n",
        "<p>side of the road.</p>\n<p>Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t you walk around the hole?” asked the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know enough,” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“My head is</p>\n<p>stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask</p>\n",
        "<p>him for some brains.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I see,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“But, after all, brains are not the</p>\n<p>best things in the world.”</p>\n<p>“Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman.</p>\n<p>“But once I had</p>\n",
        "<p>brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much</p>\n<p>rather have a heart.”</p>\n<p>“And why is that?” asked the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”</p>\n<p>So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told</p>\n<p>the following story:</p>\n<p>“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest</p>\n",
        "<p>and sold the wood for a living.</p>\n<p>When I grew up, I too became a</p>\n<p>wood-chopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as</p>\n<p>long as she lived.</p>\n<p>Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone</p>\n<p>I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.</p>\n<p>“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon</p>\n",
        "<p>grew to love her with all my heart.</p>\n<p>She, on her part, promised to marry</p>\n<p>me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for</p>\n<p>her; so I set to work harder than ever.</p>\n<p>But the girl lived with an old</p>\n<p>woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she</p>\n<p>wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the</p>\n",
        "<p>housework.</p>\n<p>So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and</p>\n<p>promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.</p>\n<p>Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping</p>\n<p>away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my</p>\n<p>wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my</p>\n<p>left leg.</p>\n",
        "<p>“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man</p>\n<p>could not do very well as a wood-chopper.</p>\n<p>So I went to a tinsmith and</p>\n<p>had him make me a new leg out of tin.</p>\n<p>The leg worked very well, once I</p>\n<p>was used to it.</p>\n<p>But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for</p>\n",
        "<p>she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin</p>\n<p>girl.</p>\n<p>When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right</p>\n<p>leg.</p>\n<p>Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of</p>\n<p>tin.</p>\n<p>After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;</p>\n",
        "<p>but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones.</p>\n<p>The Wicked</p>\n<p>Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I</p>\n<p>thought that was the end of me.</p>\n<p>But the tinsmith happened to come</p>\n<p>along, and he made me a new head out of tin.</p>\n<p>“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than</p>\n",
        "<p>ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be.</p>\n<p>She thought of a</p>\n<p>new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my</p>\n<p>axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into</p>\n<p>two halves.</p>\n<p>Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body</p>\n<p>of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of</p>\n",
        "<p>joints, so that I could move around as well as ever.</p>\n<p>But, alas!</p>\n<p>I had</p>\n<p>now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did</p>\n<p>not care whether I married her or not.</p>\n<p>I suppose she is still living</p>\n<p>with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.</p>\n",
        "<p>“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and</p>\n<p>it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me.</p>\n<p>There</p>\n<p>was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in</p>\n<p>my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it.</p>\n<p>However,</p>\n<p>there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a</p>\n",
        "<p>rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I</p>\n<p>was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me.</p>\n<p>It was a</p>\n<p>terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time</p>\n<p>to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.</p>\n<p>While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can</p>\n<p>love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me</p>\n",
        "<p>one.</p>\n<p>If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”</p>\n<p>Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story</p>\n<p>of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a</p>\n<p>new heart.</p>\n<p>“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brains instead of</p>\n<p>a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had</p>\n",
        "<p>one.”</p>\n<p>“I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “for brains do not</p>\n<p>make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her</p>\n<p>two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to</p>\n<p>Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had</p>\n<p>no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.</p>\n",
        "<p>What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another</p>\n<p>meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket.</p>\n<p>To be sure, neither</p>\n<p>the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made</p>\n<p>of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.</p>\n<p>Chapter VI</p>\n<p>The Cowardly Lion</p>\n",
        "<p>All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the</p>\n<p>thick woods.</p>\n<p>The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were</p>\n<p>much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the</p>\n<p>walking was not at all good.</p>\n<p>There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the</p>\n<p>open country where there is plenty of sunshine.</p>\n",
        "<p>But now and then there</p>\n<p>came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees.</p>\n<p>These</p>\n<p>sounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast, for she did not know</p>\n<p>what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy’s side,</p>\n<p>and did not even bark in return.</p>\n<p>“How long will it be,” the child asked of the Tin Woodman, “before we</p>\n",
        "<p>are out of the forest?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been to the Emerald</p>\n<p>City.</p>\n<p>But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it</p>\n<p>was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the</p>\n<p>city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful.</p>\n<p>But I am not afraid so</p>\n",
        "<p>long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while</p>\n<p>you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss, and that</p>\n<p>will protect you from harm.”</p>\n<p>“But Toto!” said the girl anxiously.</p>\n<p>“What will protect him?”</p>\n<p>“We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the Tin</p>\n<p>Woodman.</p>\n",
        "<p>Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the</p>\n<p>next moment a great Lion bounded into the road.</p>\n<p>With one blow of his</p>\n<p>paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the</p>\n<p>road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws.</p>\n<p>But,</p>\n<p>to the Lion’s surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,</p>\n",
        "<p>although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.</p>\n<p>Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the</p>\n<p>Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when</p>\n<p>Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed</p>\n<p>forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while</p>\n<p>she cried out:</p>\n<p>“Don’t you dare to bite Toto!</p>\n",
        "<p>You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a</p>\n<p>big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t bite him,” said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw</p>\n<p>where Dorothy had hit it.</p>\n<p>“No, but you tried to,” she retorted.</p>\n<p>“You are nothing but a big</p>\n<p>coward.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I know it,” said the Lion, hanging his head in shame.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always</p>\n<p>known it.</p>\n<p>But how can I help it?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure.</p>\n<p>To think of your striking a stuffed man, like</p>\n<p>the poor Scarecrow!”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Is he stuffed?” asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up</p>\n<p>the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into</p>\n<p>shape again.</p>\n<p>“Of course he’s stuffed,” replied Dorothy, who was still angry.</p>\n<p>“That’s why he went over so easily,” remarked the Lion.</p>\n<p>“It astonished</p>\n<p>me to see him whirl around so.</p>\n",
        "<p>Is the other one stuffed also?”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Dorothy, “he’s made of tin.” And she helped the Woodman up</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>“That’s why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Lion.</p>\n<p>“When they</p>\n<p>scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back.</p>\n<p>What</p>\n",
        "<p>is that little animal you are so tender of?”</p>\n<p>“He is my dog, Toto,” answered Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Lion.</p>\n<p>“Neither.</p>\n<p>He’s a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl.</p>\n<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>He’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look</p>\n",
        "<p>at him.</p>\n<p>No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a</p>\n<p>coward like me,” continued the Lion sadly.</p>\n<p>“What makes you a coward?” asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in</p>\n<p>wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.</p>\n<p>“It’s a mystery,” replied the Lion.</p>\n<p>“I suppose I was born that way.</p>\n",
        "<p>All</p>\n<p>the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for</p>\n<p>the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts.</p>\n<p>I learned that</p>\n<p>if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out</p>\n<p>of my way.</p>\n<p>Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but I just</p>\n",
        "<p>roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go.</p>\n<p>If</p>\n<p>the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,</p>\n<p>I should have run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they</p>\n<p>hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them</p>\n<p>go.”</p>\n<p>“But that isn’t right.</p>\n",
        "<p>The King of Beasts shouldn’t be a coward,” said</p>\n<p>the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“I know it,” returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip</p>\n<p>of his tail.</p>\n<p>“It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.</p>\n<p>But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n",
        "<p>“It may be,” said the Lion.</p>\n<p>“If you have,” continued the Tin Woodman, “you ought to be glad, for it</p>\n<p>proves you have a heart.</p>\n<p>For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have</p>\n<p>heart disease.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps,” said the Lion thoughtfully, “if I had no heart I should not</p>\n<p>be a coward.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Have you brains?” asked the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“I suppose so.</p>\n<p>I’ve never looked to see,” replied the Lion.</p>\n<p>“I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,” remarked the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”</p>\n<p>“And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman.</p>\n<p>“And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,” added</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Do you think Oz could give me courage?” asked the Cowardly Lion.</p>\n<p>“Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“Or give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“Or send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Then, if you don’t mind, I’ll go with you,” said the Lion, “for my</p>\n<p>life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you will help to</p>\n<p>keep away the other wild beasts.</p>\n<p>It seems to me they must be more</p>\n<p>cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”</p>\n<p>“They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn’t make me any braver,</p>\n<p>and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.”</p>\n<p>So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion</p>\n",
        "<p>walking with stately strides at Dorothy’s side.</p>\n<p>Toto did not approve of</p>\n<p>this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had</p>\n<p>been crushed between the Lion’s great jaws.</p>\n<p>But after a time he became</p>\n<p>more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be</p>\n<p>good friends.</p>\n",
        "<p>During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the</p>\n<p>peace of their journey.</p>\n<p>Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a</p>\n<p>beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little</p>\n<p>thing.</p>\n<p>This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always</p>\n<p>careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept</p>\n",
        "<p>several tears of sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>These tears ran slowly down his</p>\n<p>face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted.</p>\n<p>When</p>\n<p>Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open</p>\n<p>his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together.</p>\n<p>He became greatly</p>\n",
        "<p>frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but</p>\n<p>she could not understand.</p>\n<p>The Lion was also puzzled to know what was</p>\n<p>wrong.</p>\n<p>But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and</p>\n<p>oiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as</p>\n<p>well as before.</p>\n",
        "<p>“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step.</p>\n<p>For if I</p>\n<p>should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying</p>\n<p>rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”</p>\n<p>Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and</p>\n<p>when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to</p>\n<p>harm it.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore</p>\n<p>he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.</p>\n<p>“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and</p>\n<p>need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very</p>\n<p>careful.</p>\n<p>When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind so much.”</p>\n<p>Chapter VII</p>\n",
        "<p>The Journey to the Great Oz</p>\n<p>They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the</p>\n<p>forest, for there were no houses near.</p>\n<p>The tree made a good, thick</p>\n<p>covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a</p>\n<p>great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that</p>\n<p>warmed her and made her feel less lonely.</p>\n",
        "<p>She and Toto ate the last of</p>\n<p>their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.</p>\n<p>“If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest and kill a</p>\n<p>deer for you.</p>\n<p>You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so</p>\n<p>peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very</p>\n<p>good breakfast.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Don’t!</p>\n<p>Please don’t,” begged the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“I should certainly weep</p>\n<p>if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.”</p>\n<p>But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no</p>\n<p>one ever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it.</p>\n<p>And the Scarecrow</p>\n",
        "<p>found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so</p>\n<p>that she would not be hungry for a long time.</p>\n<p>She thought this was very</p>\n<p>kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the</p>\n<p>awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts.</p>\n<p>His padded</p>\n<p>hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost</p>\n",
        "<p>as many as he put in the basket.</p>\n<p>But the Scarecrow did not mind how</p>\n<p>long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away</p>\n<p>from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn</p>\n<p>him up.</p>\n<p>So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came</p>\n<p>near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.</p>\n",
        "<p>These</p>\n<p>kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.</p>\n<p>When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling</p>\n<p>brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.</p>\n<p>This was to be an eventful day for the travelers.</p>\n<p>They had hardly been</p>\n<p>walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed</p>\n",
        "<p>the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either</p>\n<p>side.</p>\n<p>It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and</p>\n<p>looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were</p>\n<p>many big, jagged rocks at the bottom.</p>\n<p>The sides were so steep that none</p>\n<p>of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey</p>\n",
        "<p>must end.</p>\n<p>“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.</p>\n<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook</p>\n<p>his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.</p>\n<p>But the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain.</p>\n<p>Neither can we</p>\n<p>climb down into this great ditch.</p>\n",
        "<p>Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,</p>\n<p>we must stop where we are.”</p>\n<p>“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring</p>\n<p>the distance carefully in his mind.</p>\n<p>“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us</p>\n<p>all over on your back, one at a time.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Who will go first?”</p>\n<p>“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you could not</p>\n<p>jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly</p>\n<p>dented on the rocks below.</p>\n<p>But if I am on your back it will not matter</p>\n<p>so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”</p>\n<p>“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion, “but</p>\n",
        "<p>I suppose there is nothing to do but try it.</p>\n<p>So get on my back and we</p>\n<p>will make the attempt.”</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s back, and the big beast walked to the</p>\n<p>edge of the gulf and crouched down.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“Because that isn’t the way we Lions do these things,” he replied.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then</p>\n<p>giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the</p>\n<p>other side.</p>\n<p>They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,</p>\n<p>and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang</p>\n<p>across the ditch again.</p>\n<p>Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and</p>\n",
        "<p>climbed on the Lion’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.</p>\n<p>The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and</p>\n<p>then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other</p>\n<p>side.</p>\n<p>The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then</p>\n<p>they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,</p>\n<p>for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big</p>\n",
        "<p>dog that has been running too long.</p>\n<p>They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and</p>\n<p>gloomy.</p>\n<p>After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow</p>\n<p>brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would</p>\n<p>come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again.</p>\n<p>To</p>\n",
        "<p>add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths</p>\n<p>of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part</p>\n<p>of the country that the Kalidahs lived.</p>\n<p>“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.</p>\n<p>“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like</p>\n<p>tigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp that they</p>\n<p>could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto.</p>\n",
        "<p>I’m terribly</p>\n<p>afraid of the Kalidahs.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“They must be</p>\n<p>dreadful beasts.”</p>\n<p>The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf</p>\n<p>across the road.</p>\n",
        "<p>But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew</p>\n<p>at once he could not leap across it.</p>\n<p>So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious</p>\n<p>thought the Scarecrow said:</p>\n<p>“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch.</p>\n<p>If the Tin Woodman</p>\n<p>can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk</p>\n",
        "<p>across it easily.”</p>\n<p>“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion.</p>\n<p>“One would almost suspect</p>\n<p>you had brains in your head, instead of straw.”</p>\n<p>The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree</p>\n<p>was soon chopped nearly through.</p>\n<p>Then the Lion put his strong front</p>\n",
        "<p>legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big</p>\n<p>tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top</p>\n<p>branches on the other side.</p>\n<p>They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl</p>\n<p>made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them</p>\n<p>two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.</p>\n<p>“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“Let us cross over.”</p>\n<p>So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman</p>\n<p>followed, and the Scarecrow came next.</p>\n<p>The Lion, although he was</p>\n<p>certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud</p>\n<p>and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over</p>\n",
        "<p>backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him</p>\n<p>in surprise.</p>\n<p>But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there</p>\n<p>were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed</p>\n<p>forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they</p>\n<p>would do next.</p>\n<p>Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began</p>\n",
        "<p>to cross the tree.</p>\n<p>And the Lion said to Dorothy:</p>\n<p>“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp</p>\n<p>claws.</p>\n<p>But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am</p>\n<p>alive.”</p>\n<p>“Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>He had been thinking what was</p>\n<p>best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of</p>\n<p>the tree that rested on their side of the ditch.</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman began</p>\n<p>to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly</p>\n<p>across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,</p>\n<p>snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp</p>\n",
        "<p>rocks at the bottom.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, “I see</p>\n<p>we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it</p>\n<p>must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive.</p>\n<p>Those creatures</p>\n<p>frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart to beat.”</p>\n",
        "<p>This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of</p>\n<p>the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had</p>\n<p>to ride on the Lion’s back.</p>\n<p>To their great joy the trees became thinner</p>\n<p>the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon</p>\n<p>a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them.</p>\n<p>On the other side of</p>\n",
        "<p>the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a</p>\n<p>beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and</p>\n<p>all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.</p>\n<p>“How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The Tin Woodman must</p>\n<p>build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”</p>\n<p>So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make</p>\n<p>a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the</p>\n<p>riverbank a tree full of fine fruit.</p>\n<p>This pleased Dorothy, who had</p>\n<p>eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe</p>\n",
        "<p>fruit.</p>\n<p>But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and</p>\n<p>untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.</p>\n<p>So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until</p>\n<p>the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good</p>\n<p>Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.</p>\n<p>Chapter VIII</p>\n",
        "<p>The Deadly Poppy Field</p>\n<p>Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and</p>\n<p>full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and</p>\n<p>plums from the trees beside the river.</p>\n<p>Behind them was the dark forest</p>\n<p>they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many</p>\n<p>discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that</p>\n",
        "<p>seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.</p>\n<p>But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few</p>\n<p>more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready</p>\n<p>to start.</p>\n<p>Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in</p>\n<p>her arms.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,</p>\n<p>for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood</p>\n<p>upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands</p>\n<p>to push the raft through the water.</p>\n<p>They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of</p>\n<p>the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and</p>\n<p>farther away from the road of yellow brick.</p>\n",
        "<p>And the water grew so deep</p>\n<p>that the long poles would not touch the bottom.</p>\n<p>“This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get to the land</p>\n<p>we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,</p>\n<p>and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”</p>\n<p>“And then I should get no brains,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“And I should get no courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.</p>\n",
        "<p>“And I should get no heart,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the Scarecrow</p>\n<p>continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in</p>\n<p>the mud at the bottom of the river.</p>\n<p>Then, before he could pull it out</p>\n<p>again—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was</p>\n",
        "<p>left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.</p>\n<p>“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered</p>\n<p>that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy’s apron.</p>\n<p>Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Then,</p>\n<p>I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare</p>\n<p>the crows, at any rate.</p>\n<p>But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow</p>\n<p>stuck on a pole in the middle of a river.</p>\n<p>I am afraid I shall never</p>\n<p>have any brains, after all!”</p>\n",
        "<p>Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far</p>\n<p>behind.</p>\n<p>Then the Lion said:</p>\n<p>“Something must be done to save us.</p>\n<p>I think I can swim to the shore and</p>\n<p>pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my</p>\n<p>tail.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of</p>\n<p>his tail.</p>\n<p>Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the</p>\n<p>shore.</p>\n<p>It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they</p>\n<p>were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman’s</p>\n<p>long pole and helped push the raft to the land.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped</p>\n<p>off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had</p>\n<p>carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the</p>\n<p>Emerald City.</p>\n<p>“What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on</p>\n<p>the grass to let the sun dry him.</p>\n<p>“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the</p>\n<p>road again,” remarked the Lion.</p>\n<p>So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they</p>\n<p>started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had</p>\n<p>carried them.</p>\n<p>It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit</p>\n<p>trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for</p>\n",
        "<p>the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.</p>\n<p>They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to</p>\n<p>pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:</p>\n<p>“Look!”</p>\n<p>Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon</p>\n<p>his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.</p>\n<p>“What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.</p>\n<p>So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow</p>\n<p>until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the</p>\n<p>water’s edge.</p>\n<p>“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.</p>\n<p>“I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends, the Tin</p>\n<p>Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and</p>\n<p>looked sharply at the queer party.</p>\n<p>“I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are</p>\n<p>wondering how we shall get him again.”</p>\n<p>“Where is he?” asked the Stork.</p>\n<p>“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.</p>\n<p>“If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,” remarked the</p>\n",
        "<p>Stork.</p>\n<p>“He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for he is stuffed with</p>\n<p>straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever</p>\n<p>and ever so much.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is too heavy to</p>\n<p>carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”</p>\n<p>So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to</p>\n",
        "<p>where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole.</p>\n<p>Then the Stork with her</p>\n<p>great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into</p>\n<p>the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin</p>\n<p>Woodman and Toto were sitting.</p>\n<p>When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so</p>\n<p>happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they</p>\n",
        "<p>walked along he sang “Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.</p>\n<p>“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said,</p>\n<p>“but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find</p>\n<p>the Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”</p>\n<p>“That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.</p>\n<p>“I always like to help anyone in trouble.</p>\n<p>But I must go now, for my</p>\n",
        "<p>babies are waiting in the nest for me.</p>\n<p>I hope you will find the Emerald</p>\n<p>City and that Oz will help you.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air</p>\n<p>and was soon out of sight.</p>\n<p>They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored</p>\n<p>birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that</p>\n",
        "<p>the ground was carpeted with them.</p>\n<p>There were big yellow and white and</p>\n<p>blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,</p>\n<p>which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy</p>\n<p>scent of the bright flowers.</p>\n<p>“I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“When I have brains, I shall</p>\n<p>probably like them better.”</p>\n<p>“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“I always did like flowers,” said the Lion.</p>\n<p>“They seem so helpless and</p>\n<p>frail.</p>\n<p>But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”</p>\n",
        "<p>They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer</p>\n<p>and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the</p>\n<p>midst of a great meadow of poppies.</p>\n<p>Now it is well known that when</p>\n<p>there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that</p>\n<p>anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried</p>\n<p>away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever.</p>\n",
        "<p>But</p>\n<p>Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red</p>\n<p>flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy</p>\n<p>and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.</p>\n<p>But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.</p>\n<p>“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,”</p>\n<p>he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him.</p>\n",
        "<p>So they kept walking until</p>\n<p>Dorothy could stand no longer.</p>\n<p>Her eyes closed in spite of herself and</p>\n<p>she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.</p>\n<p>“What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion.</p>\n<p>“The smell of the</p>\n",
        "<p>flowers is killing us all.</p>\n<p>I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and</p>\n<p>the dog is asleep already.”</p>\n<p>It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress.</p>\n<p>But the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not</p>\n<p>troubled by the scent of the flowers.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out of this deadly</p>\n<p>flower bed as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>We will bring the little girl with us,</p>\n<p>but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”</p>\n<p>So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.</p>\n<p>In a moment he was out of sight.</p>\n<p>“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, and then they</p>\n<p>made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms</p>\n<p>and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.</p>\n<p>On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly</p>\n<p>flowers that surrounded them would never end.</p>\n<p>They followed the bend of</p>\n<p>the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast</p>\n",
        "<p>asleep among the poppies.</p>\n<p>The flowers had been too strong for the huge</p>\n<p>beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance</p>\n<p>from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in</p>\n<p>beautiful green fields before them.</p>\n<p>“We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly; “for he is</p>\n<p>much too heavy to lift.</p>\n",
        "<p>We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and</p>\n<p>perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“The Lion was a very good comrade for</p>\n<p>one so cowardly.</p>\n<p>But let us go on.”</p>\n<p>They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far</p>\n",
        "<p>enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the</p>\n<p>poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass</p>\n<p>and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.</p>\n<p>Chapter IX</p>\n<p>The Queen of the Field Mice</p>\n<p>“We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far</p>\n",
        "<p>as the river carried us away.”</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and</p>\n<p>turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange</p>\n<p>beast come bounding over the grass toward them.</p>\n<p>It was, indeed, a great</p>\n<p>yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,</p>\n<p>for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,</p>\n",
        "<p>showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of</p>\n<p>fire.</p>\n<p>As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the</p>\n<p>beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he</p>\n<p>knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,</p>\n<p>harmless creature.</p>\n<p>So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a</p>\n",
        "<p>quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it</p>\n<p>rolled over at his feet in two pieces.</p>\n<p>The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;</p>\n<p>and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:</p>\n<p>“Oh, thank you!</p>\n<p>Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I have no</p>\n<p>heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a</p>\n<p>friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”</p>\n<p>“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Why, I am a</p>\n<p>Queen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in</p>\n<p>saving my life,” added the Queen.</p>\n<p>At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their</p>\n<p>little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they</p>\n<p>exclaimed:</p>\n<p>“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed!</p>\n<p>How did you manage</p>\n",
        "<p>to escape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen</p>\n<p>that they almost stood upon their heads.</p>\n<p>“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and saved my</p>\n<p>life.</p>\n<p>So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest</p>\n<p>wish.”</p>\n<p>“We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus.</p>\n",
        "<p>And then they</p>\n<p>scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and</p>\n<p>seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped</p>\n<p>right into the middle of the group.</p>\n<p>Toto had always loved to chase mice</p>\n<p>when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.</p>\n<p>But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,</p>\n",
        "<p>while he called to the mice, “Come back!</p>\n<p>Come back!</p>\n<p>Toto shall not hurt</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a</p>\n<p>clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, “Are you sure he will not</p>\n<p>bite us?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be afraid.”</p>\n<p>One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,</p>\n<p>although he tried to get out of the Woodman’s arms, and would have</p>\n<p>bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin.</p>\n<p>Finally one</p>\n<p>of the biggest mice spoke.</p>\n<p>“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for saving the</p>\n",
        "<p>life of our Queen?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who</p>\n<p>had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed</p>\n<p>with straw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the</p>\n<p>Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”</p>\n<p>“A Lion!” cried the little Queen.</p>\n<p>“Why, he would eat us all up.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is a coward.”</p>\n<p>“Really?” asked the Mouse.</p>\n<p>“He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he would never hurt</p>\n<p>anyone who is our friend.</p>\n<p>If you will help us to save him I promise</p>\n<p>that he shall treat you all with kindness.”</p>\n<p>“Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you.</p>\n",
        "<p>But what shall we do?”</p>\n<p>“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to</p>\n<p>obey you?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.</p>\n<p>“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each</p>\n<p>one bring a long piece of string.”</p>\n<p>The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at</p>\n",
        "<p>once and get all her people.</p>\n<p>As soon as they heard her orders they ran</p>\n<p>away in every direction as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go to those</p>\n<p>trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”</p>\n<p>So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon</p>\n<p>made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all</p>\n",
        "<p>the leaves and branches.</p>\n<p>He fastened it together with wooden pegs and</p>\n<p>made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk.</p>\n<p>So fast</p>\n<p>and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the</p>\n<p>truck was all ready for them.</p>\n<p>They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big</p>\n",
        "<p>mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a</p>\n<p>piece of string in his mouth.</p>\n<p>It was about this time that Dorothy woke</p>\n<p>from her long sleep and opened her eyes.</p>\n<p>She was greatly astonished to</p>\n<p>find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing</p>\n<p>around and looking at her timidly.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the Scarecrow told her about</p>\n<p>everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:</p>\n<p>“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she</p>\n<p>became quite friendly with the little girl.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the</p>\n<p>truck, using the strings they had brought.</p>\n",
        "<p>One end of a string was tied</p>\n<p>around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck.</p>\n<p>Of course</p>\n<p>the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to</p>\n<p>draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to</p>\n<p>pull it quite easily.</p>\n<p>Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit</p>\n",
        "<p>on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place</p>\n<p>where the Lion lay asleep.</p>\n<p>After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed</p>\n<p>to get him up on the truck.</p>\n<p>Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people</p>\n<p>the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies</p>\n<p>too long they also would fall asleep.</p>\n",
        "<p>At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir</p>\n<p>the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed</p>\n<p>from behind, and they got along better.</p>\n<p>Soon they rolled the Lion out</p>\n<p>of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,</p>\n<p>fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.</p>\n<p>Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving</p>\n",
        "<p>her companion from death.</p>\n<p>She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was</p>\n<p>glad he had been rescued.</p>\n<p>Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away</p>\n<p>through the grass to their homes.</p>\n<p>The Queen of the Mice was the last to</p>\n<p>leave.</p>\n",
        "<p>“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and</p>\n<p>call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance.</p>\n<p>Good-bye!”</p>\n<p>“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy</p>\n<p>held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.</p>\n<p>After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and</p>\n<p>the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she</p>\n",
        "<p>ate for her dinner.</p>\n<p>Chapter X</p>\n<p>The Guardian of the Gate</p>\n<p>It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain</p>\n<p>among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;</p>\n<p>but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad</p>\n<p>to find himself still alive.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the</p>\n<p>flowers were too strong for me.</p>\n<p>How did you get me out?”</p>\n<p>Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved</p>\n<p>him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:</p>\n<p>“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little</p>\n<p>things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as</p>\n",
        "<p>mice have saved my life.</p>\n<p>How strange it all is!</p>\n<p>But, comrades, what</p>\n<p>shall we do now?”</p>\n<p>“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said</p>\n<p>Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”</p>\n<p>So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,</p>\n",
        "<p>they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through</p>\n<p>the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road</p>\n<p>of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the</p>\n<p>Great Oz dwelt.</p>\n<p>The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was</p>\n<p>beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far</p>\n<p>behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.</p>\n",
        "<p>Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were</p>\n<p>painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer</p>\n<p>evidently lived, that also was painted green.</p>\n<p>They passed by several of</p>\n<p>these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the</p>\n<p>doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no</p>\n<p>one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of</p>\n",
        "<p>which they were very much afraid.</p>\n<p>The people were all dressed in</p>\n<p>clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like</p>\n<p>those of the Munchkins.</p>\n<p>“This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are surely getting</p>\n<p>near the Emerald City.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Everything is green here, while in the</p>\n<p>country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color.</p>\n<p>But the people do</p>\n<p>not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we shall be</p>\n<p>unable to find a place to pass the night.”</p>\n<p>“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I’m</p>\n<p>sure Toto is nearly starved.</p>\n",
        "<p>Let us stop at the next house and talk to</p>\n<p>the people.”</p>\n<p>So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up</p>\n<p>to the door and knocked.</p>\n<p>A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you</p>\n<p>want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”</p>\n<p>“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you</p>\n<p>for the world.”</p>\n<p>“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too.</p>\n<p>He will be</p>\n<p>more afraid of you than you are of him.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep</p>\n",
        "<p>at the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you</p>\n<p>some supper and a place to sleep.”</p>\n<p>So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two</p>\n<p>children and a man.</p>\n<p>The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the</p>\n<p>couch in a corner.</p>\n<p>They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a</p>\n",
        "<p>company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:</p>\n<p>“Where are you all going?”</p>\n<p>“To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great Oz.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man.</p>\n<p>“Are you sure that Oz will see you?”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” she replied.</p>\n<p>“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence.</p>\n",
        "<p>I</p>\n<p>have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and</p>\n<p>wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,</p>\n<p>nor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”</p>\n<p>“Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“Never.</p>\n<p>He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,</p>\n",
        "<p>and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”</p>\n<p>“What is he like?” asked the girl.</p>\n<p>“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>“You see, Oz is a</p>\n<p>Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes.</p>\n<p>So that some say he</p>\n<p>looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say</p>\n",
        "<p>he looks like a cat.</p>\n<p>To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a</p>\n<p>brownie, or in any other form that pleases him.</p>\n<p>But who the real Oz is,</p>\n<p>when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”</p>\n<p>“That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in some way, to</p>\n<p>see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.</p>\n<p>“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man.</p>\n<p>“He has more</p>\n<p>brains than he needs.”</p>\n<p>“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a large</p>\n",
        "<p>collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”</p>\n<p>“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.</p>\n<p>“Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man,</p>\n<p>“which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running</p>\n<p>over.</p>\n<p>He will be glad to give you some.”</p>\n<p>“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and</p>\n<p>I’m sure it’s somewhere.”</p>\n<p>“Very likely.</p>\n<p>Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find</p>\n<p>Kansas for you.</p>\n<p>But first you must get to see him, and that will be a</p>\n",
        "<p>hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he</p>\n<p>usually has his own way.</p>\n<p>But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking</p>\n<p>to Toto.</p>\n<p>Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not</p>\n<p>speak.</p>\n<p>The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered</p>\n",
        "<p>around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of</p>\n<p>scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.</p>\n<p>The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it</p>\n<p>was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all.</p>\n<p>Toto ate a little of</p>\n",
        "<p>everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.</p>\n<p>The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside</p>\n<p>her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be</p>\n<p>disturbed.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and</p>\n<p>kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.</p>\n<p>The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way,</p>\n",
        "<p>and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.</p>\n<p>“That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it</p>\n<p>seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels.</p>\n<p>Yet it</p>\n<p>was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the</p>\n<p>City.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was high and thick and of a bright green color.</p>\n<p>In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big</p>\n<p>gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even</p>\n<p>the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.</p>\n<p>There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and</p>\n<p>heard a silvery tinkle sound within.</p>\n<p>Then the big gate swung slowly</p>\n",
        "<p>open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched</p>\n<p>room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.</p>\n<p>Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin</p>\n<p>was of a greenish tint.</p>\n<p>At his side was a large green box.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish</p>\n<p>in the Emerald City?”</p>\n<p>“We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it</p>\n<p>over.</p>\n<p>“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said,</p>\n<p>shaking his head in perplexity.</p>\n",
        "<p>“He is powerful and terrible, and if</p>\n<p>you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of</p>\n<p>the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”</p>\n<p>“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow; “it is important.</p>\n<p>And we have been told that Oz is a good</p>\n<p>Wizard.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely</p>\n<p>and well.</p>\n<p>But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from</p>\n<p>curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his</p>\n<p>face.</p>\n<p>I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the</p>\n<p>Great Oz I must take you to his Palace.</p>\n",
        "<p>But first you must put on the</p>\n<p>spectacles.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the</p>\n<p>Emerald City would blind you.</p>\n<p>Even those who live in the City must wear</p>\n<p>spectacles night and day.</p>\n",
        "<p>They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it</p>\n<p>when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with</p>\n<p>spectacles of every size and shape.</p>\n<p>All of them had green glasses in</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit</p>\n<p>Dorothy and put them over her eyes.</p>\n<p>There were two golden bands</p>\n<p>fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they</p>\n<p>were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the</p>\n<p>Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck.</p>\n<p>When they were on, Dorothy</p>\n",
        "<p>could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish</p>\n<p>to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.</p>\n<p>Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin</p>\n<p>Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast</p>\n<p>with the key.</p>\n<p>Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he</p>\n<p>was ready to show them to the Palace.</p>\n",
        "<p>Taking a big golden key from a</p>\n<p>peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him</p>\n<p>through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.</p>\n<p>Chapter XI</p>\n<p>The Wonderful City of Oz</p>\n<p>Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her</p>\n<p>friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.</p>\n",
        "<p>The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble</p>\n<p>and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds.</p>\n<p>They walked over a</p>\n<p>pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined</p>\n<p>together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the</p>\n<p>brightness of the sun.</p>\n<p>The window panes were of green glass; even the</p>\n",
        "<p>sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were</p>\n<p>green.</p>\n<p>There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and</p>\n<p>these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering</p>\n<p>eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when</p>\n",
        "<p>they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them.</p>\n<p>Many shops stood in the</p>\n<p>street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green.</p>\n<p>Green candy</p>\n<p>and green pop-corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green</p>\n<p>hats, and green clothes of all sorts.</p>\n<p>At one place a man was selling</p>\n",
        "<p>green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that</p>\n<p>they paid for it with green pennies.</p>\n<p>There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried</p>\n<p>things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.</p>\n<p>Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.</p>\n<p>The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came</p>\n<p>to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the</p>\n",
        "<p>Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard.</p>\n<p>There was a soldier before the door,</p>\n<p>dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.</p>\n<p>“Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him, “and they</p>\n<p>demand to see the Great Oz.”</p>\n<p>“Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry your message to</p>\n<p>him.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room</p>\n<p>with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering</p>\n<p>this room, and when they were seated he said politely:</p>\n<p>“Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the</p>\n<p>Throne Room and tell Oz you are here.”</p>\n",
        "<p>They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned.</p>\n<p>When, at</p>\n<p>last, he came back, Dorothy asked:</p>\n<p>“Have you seen Oz?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him.</p>\n<p>But I spoke to</p>\n<p>him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message.</p>\n",
        "<p>He said he</p>\n<p>will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must</p>\n<p>enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.</p>\n<p>Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will</p>\n<p>have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your</p>\n<p>journey.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind of Oz.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,</p>\n<p>dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room.</p>\n<p>She had lovely</p>\n<p>green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she</p>\n<p>said, “Follow me and I will show you your room.”</p>\n<p>So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the</p>\n<p>dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up</p>\n",
        "<p>three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the</p>\n<p>Palace.</p>\n<p>It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft</p>\n<p>comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet</p>\n<p>counterpane.</p>\n<p>There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that</p>\n<p>shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a</p>\n",
        "<p>beautifully carved green marble basin.</p>\n<p>Beautiful green flowers stood in</p>\n<p>the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.</p>\n<p>When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer</p>\n<p>green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.</p>\n<p>In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and</p>\n<p>velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and if you</p>\n<p>wish for anything ring the bell.</p>\n<p>Oz will send for you tomorrow</p>\n<p>morning.”</p>\n<p>She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others.</p>\n<p>These she also led</p>\n<p>to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant</p>\n",
        "<p>part of the Palace.</p>\n<p>Of course this politeness was wasted on the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood</p>\n<p>stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he</p>\n<p>remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web</p>\n",
        "<p>in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most</p>\n<p>wonderful rooms in the world.</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from</p>\n<p>force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not</p>\n<p>being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down</p>\n<p>to make sure they kept in good working order.</p>\n<p>The Lion would have</p>\n",
        "<p>preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being</p>\n<p>shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so</p>\n<p>he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred</p>\n<p>himself asleep in a minute.</p>\n<p>The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch</p>\n<p>Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of</p>\n<p>green brocaded satin.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a</p>\n<p>green ribbon around Toto’s neck, and they started for the Throne Room</p>\n<p>of the Great Oz.</p>\n<p>First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen</p>\n<p>of the court, all dressed in rich costumes.</p>\n<p>These people had nothing to</p>\n<p>do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the</p>\n",
        "<p>Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see</p>\n<p>Oz.</p>\n<p>As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them</p>\n<p>whispered:</p>\n<p>“Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message to</p>\n",
        "<p>the Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him.</p>\n<p>Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you</p>\n<p>came from.</p>\n<p>Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned</p>\n<p>your silver shoes he was very much interested.</p>\n<p>At last I told him about</p>\n<p>the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his</p>\n",
        "<p>presence.”</p>\n<p>Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is the</p>\n<p>signal.</p>\n<p>You must go into the Throne Room alone.”</p>\n<p>She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found</p>\n<p>herself in a wonderful place.</p>\n<p>It was a big, round room with a high</p>\n",
        "<p>arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with</p>\n<p>large emeralds set closely together.</p>\n<p>In the center of the roof was a</p>\n<p>great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a</p>\n<p>wonderful manner.</p>\n<p>But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble</p>\n<p>that stood in the middle of the room.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was shaped like a chair and</p>\n<p>sparkled with gems, as did everything else.</p>\n<p>In the center of the chair</p>\n<p>was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs</p>\n<p>whatever.</p>\n<p>There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose</p>\n<p>and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.</p>\n",
        "<p>As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly</p>\n<p>and looked at her sharply and steadily.</p>\n<p>Then the mouth moved, and</p>\n<p>Dorothy heard a voice say:</p>\n<p>“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.</p>\n<p>Who are you, and why do you seek me?”</p>\n<p>It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big</p>\n",
        "<p>Head; so she took courage and answered:</p>\n<p>“I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek.</p>\n<p>I have come to you for help.”</p>\n<p>The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute.</p>\n<p>Then said the</p>\n<p>voice:</p>\n<p>“Where did you get the silver shoes?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on</p>\n<p>her and killed her,” she replied.</p>\n<p>“Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued the voice.</p>\n<p>“That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me</p>\n<p>good-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.</p>\n<p>Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the</p>\n<p>truth.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then Oz asked, “What do you wish me to do?”</p>\n<p>“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” she</p>\n<p>answered earnestly.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like your country, although it is so</p>\n<p>beautiful.</p>\n<p>And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my</p>\n<p>being away so long.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and</p>\n<p>down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see</p>\n<p>every part of the room.</p>\n<p>And at last they looked at Dorothy again.</p>\n<p>“Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz.</p>\n<p>“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard</p>\n<p>and I am only a little girl.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,” said</p>\n<p>Oz.</p>\n<p>“That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could not help it.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer.</p>\n<p>You have no right to</p>\n<p>expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in</p>\n<p>return.</p>\n",
        "<p>In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets.</p>\n<p>If</p>\n<p>you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do</p>\n<p>something for me first.</p>\n<p>Help me and I will help you.”</p>\n<p>“What must I do?” asked the girl.</p>\n<p>“Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz.</p>\n",
        "<p>“But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.</p>\n<p>“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which</p>\n<p>bear a powerful charm.</p>\n<p>There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all</p>\n<p>this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to</p>\n<p>Kansas—but not before.”</p>\n<p>The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the</p>\n",
        "<p>eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz</p>\n<p>felt that she could help him if she would.</p>\n<p>“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed.</p>\n<p>“Even if I wanted to,</p>\n<p>how could I kill the Wicked Witch?</p>\n<p>If you, who are Great and Terrible,</p>\n<p>cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and until the</p>\n<p>Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again.</p>\n<p>Remember</p>\n<p>that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed.</p>\n<p>Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.”</p>\n<p>Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion</p>\n<p>and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had</p>\n",
        "<p>said to her.</p>\n<p>“There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Oz will</p>\n<p>not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and</p>\n<p>that I can never do.”</p>\n<p>Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy</p>\n<p>went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to</p>\n<p>sleep.</p>\n",
        "<p>The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow and said:</p>\n<p>“Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”</p>\n<p>So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne</p>\n<p>Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.</p>\n<p>She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green</p>\n<p>locks a crown of jewels.</p>\n",
        "<p>Growing from her shoulders were wings,</p>\n<p>gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest</p>\n<p>breath of air reached them.</p>\n<p>When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would</p>\n<p>let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,</p>\n<p>and said:</p>\n<p>“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.</p>\n",
        "<p>Who are you, and why do you seek me?”</p>\n<p>Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had</p>\n<p>told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.</p>\n<p>“I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw.</p>\n<p>Therefore I have no brains,</p>\n<p>and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead</p>\n<p>of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your</p>\n",
        "<p>dominions.”</p>\n<p>“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.</p>\n<p>“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,”</p>\n<p>answered the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “but this much I</p>\n<p>will promise.</p>\n<p>If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I</p>\n",
        "<p>will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you</p>\n<p>will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”</p>\n<p>“I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said the Scarecrow, in</p>\n<p>surprise.</p>\n<p>“So I did.</p>\n<p>I don’t care who kills her.</p>\n<p>But until she is dead I will not</p>\n",
        "<p>grant your wish.</p>\n<p>Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned</p>\n<p>the brains you so greatly desire.”</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what</p>\n<p>Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard</p>\n<p>was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.</p>\n<p>“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart as much as the</p>\n",
        "<p>Tin Woodman.”</p>\n<p>On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin</p>\n<p>Woodman and said:</p>\n<p>“Oz has sent for you.</p>\n<p>Follow me.”</p>\n<p>So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n",
        "<p>did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he</p>\n<p>hoped it would be the lovely Lady.</p>\n<p>“For,” he said to himself, “if it is</p>\n<p>the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no</p>\n<p>heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me.</p>\n<p>But if it is the</p>\n<p>lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves</p>\n",
        "<p>said to be kindly hearted.”</p>\n<p>But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the</p>\n<p>Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.</p>\n<p>It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly</p>\n<p>strong enough to hold its weight.</p>\n<p>The Beast had a head like that of a</p>\n<p>rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face.</p>\n",
        "<p>There were five long</p>\n<p>arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.</p>\n<p>Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more</p>\n<p>dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate the</p>\n<p>Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud</p>\n<p>and fast from terror.</p>\n",
        "<p>But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all</p>\n<p>afraid, although he was much disappointed.</p>\n<p>“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice that was</p>\n<p>one great roar.</p>\n<p>“Who are you, and why do you seek me?”</p>\n<p>“I am a Woodman, and made of tin.</p>\n<p>Therefore I have no heart, and cannot</p>\n",
        "<p>love.</p>\n<p>I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.”</p>\n<p>“Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast.</p>\n<p>“Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answered the</p>\n<p>Woodman.</p>\n<p>Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: “If you indeed desire a</p>\n<p>heart, you must earn it.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“How?” asked the Woodman.</p>\n<p>“Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied the Beast.</p>\n<p>“When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the</p>\n<p>biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”</p>\n<p>So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and</p>\n<p>tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen.</p>\n<p>They all wondered greatly</p>\n",
        "<p>at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the</p>\n<p>Lion said:</p>\n<p>“If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so</p>\n<p>frighten him that he will grant all I ask.</p>\n<p>And if he is the lovely</p>\n<p>Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my</p>\n<p>bidding.</p>\n",
        "<p>And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I</p>\n<p>will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us</p>\n<p>what we desire.</p>\n<p>So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be</p>\n<p>well.”</p>\n<p>The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to</p>\n<p>the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to</p>\n<p>his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and</p>\n<p>glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it.</p>\n<p>His first thought was</p>\n<p>that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he</p>\n<p>tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his</p>\n<p>whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the</p>\n<p>words it spoke:</p>\n<p>“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.</p>\n<p>Who are you, and why do you seek me?”</p>\n<p>And the Lion answered, “I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may</p>\n",
        "<p>become the King of Beasts, as men call me.”</p>\n<p>“Why should I give you courage?” demanded Oz.</p>\n<p>“Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to</p>\n<p>grant my request,” answered the Lion.</p>\n<p>The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, “Bring</p>\n<p>me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you</p>\n<p>courage.</p>\n",
        "<p>But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”</p>\n<p>The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and</p>\n<p>while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so</p>\n<p>furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room.</p>\n<p>He was glad</p>\n<p>to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible</p>\n<p>interview with the Wizard.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly.</p>\n<p>“There is only one thing we can do,” returned the Lion, “and that is to</p>\n<p>go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy</p>\n<p>her.”</p>\n<p>“But suppose we cannot?” said the girl.</p>\n<p>“Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion.</p>\n<p>“And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy,</p>\n<p>beginning to cry.</p>\n<p>“Be careful!” cried the green girl.</p>\n<p>“The tears will fall on your green</p>\n<p>silk gown and spot it.”</p>\n<p>So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, “I suppose we must try it; but I am</p>\n",
        "<p>sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.”</p>\n<p>“I will go with you; but I’m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,”</p>\n<p>said the Lion.</p>\n<p>“I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not be of much</p>\n<p>help to you, I am such a fool.”</p>\n<p>“I haven’t the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the Tin Woodman;</p>\n<p>“but if you go I certainly shall go with you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning,</p>\n<p>and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his</p>\n<p>joints properly oiled.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw</p>\n<p>and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy’s basket with</p>\n",
        "<p>good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto’s neck with</p>\n<p>a green ribbon.</p>\n<p>They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when</p>\n<p>they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the</p>\n<p>back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a</p>\n<p>green egg.</p>\n"

        "<h3>Chapter XII</h3>\n<p>The Search for the Wicked Witch</p>\n<p>The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the</p>\n<p>Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the</p>\n<p>Gates lived.</p>\n<p>This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in</p>\n<p>his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates.</p>\n<p>“No one ever</p>\n<p>wishes to go that way.”</p>\n<p>“How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl.</p>\n<p>“That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows you are in</p>\n<p>the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her</p>\n",
        "<p>slaves.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroy her.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates.</p>\n<p>“No one has</p>\n<p>ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves</p>\n<p>of you, as she has of the rest.</p>\n<p>But take care; for she is wicked and</p>\n",
        "<p>fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her.</p>\n<p>Keep to the West, where</p>\n<p>the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.”</p>\n<p>They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West,</p>\n<p>walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies</p>\n<p>and buttercups.</p>\n<p>Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on</p>\n",
        "<p>in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer</p>\n<p>green, but pure white.</p>\n<p>The ribbon around Toto’s neck had also lost its</p>\n<p>green color and was as white as Dorothy’s dress.</p>\n<p>The Emerald City was soon left far behind.</p>\n<p>As they advanced the ground</p>\n<p>became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this</p>\n",
        "<p>country of the West, and the ground was untilled.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no</p>\n<p>trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and</p>\n<p>the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with</p>\n<p>the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.</p>\n<p>Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as</p>\n<p>powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere.</p>\n",
        "<p>So, as she sat in</p>\n<p>the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy</p>\n<p>lying asleep, with her friends all about her.</p>\n<p>They were a long distance</p>\n<p>off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she</p>\n<p>blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.</p>\n<p>At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great</p>\n",
        "<p>wolves.</p>\n<p>They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.</p>\n<p>“Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them to pieces.”</p>\n<p>“Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader of the</p>\n<p>wolves.</p>\n<p>“No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and</p>\n<p>another a Lion.</p>\n",
        "<p>None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into</p>\n<p>small pieces.”</p>\n<p>“Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed</p>\n<p>by the others.</p>\n<p>It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard</p>\n<p>the wolves coming.</p>\n<p>“This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and I will meet</p>\n",
        "<p>them as they come.”</p>\n<p>He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of</p>\n<p>the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s</p>\n<p>head from its body, so that it immediately died.</p>\n<p>As soon as he could</p>\n<p>raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp</p>\n<p>edge of the Tin Woodman’s weapon.</p>\n",
        "<p>There were forty wolves, and forty</p>\n<p>times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap</p>\n<p>before the Woodman.</p>\n<p>Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, “It</p>\n<p>was a good fight, friend.”</p>\n<p>They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning.</p>\n<p>The little girl was</p>\n",
        "<p>quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the</p>\n<p>Tin Woodman told her all.</p>\n<p>She thanked him for saving them and sat down</p>\n<p>to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.</p>\n<p>Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle</p>\n<p>and looked out with her one eye that could see far off.</p>\n<p>She saw all her</p>\n",
        "<p>wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her</p>\n<p>country.</p>\n<p>This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver</p>\n<p>whistle twice.</p>\n<p>Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough</p>\n<p>to darken the sky.</p>\n<p>And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, “Fly at once to the</p>\n",
        "<p>strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.”</p>\n<p>The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her</p>\n<p>companions.</p>\n<p>When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.</p>\n<p>But the Scarecrow said, “This is my battle, so lie down beside me and</p>\n<p>you will not be harmed.”</p>\n<p>So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up</p>\n",
        "<p>and stretched out his arms.</p>\n<p>And when the crows saw him they were</p>\n<p>frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare</p>\n<p>to come any nearer.</p>\n<p>But the King Crow said:</p>\n<p>“It is only a stuffed man.</p>\n<p>I will peck his eyes out.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and</p>\n<p>twisted its neck until it died.</p>\n<p>And then another crow flew at him, and</p>\n<p>the Scarecrow twisted its neck also.</p>\n<p>There were forty crows, and forty</p>\n<p>times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead</p>\n<p>beside him.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they</p>\n<p>went upon their journey.</p>\n<p>When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a</p>\n<p>heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her</p>\n<p>silver whistle.</p>\n<p>Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of</p>\n<p>black bees came flying toward her.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Go to the strangers and sting them to death!” commanded the Witch, and</p>\n<p>the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and</p>\n<p>her friends were walking.</p>\n<p>But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow had decided what to do.</p>\n<p>“Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and</p>\n<p>the Lion,” he said to the Woodman, “and the bees cannot sting them.”</p>\n",
        "<p>This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held</p>\n<p>Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.</p>\n<p>The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew</p>\n<p>at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting</p>\n<p>the Woodman at all.</p>\n<p>And as bees cannot live when their stings are</p>\n<p>broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick</p>\n",
        "<p>about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.</p>\n<p>Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman</p>\n<p>put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as</p>\n<p>ever.</p>\n<p>So they started upon their journey once more.</p>\n<p>The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little</p>\n<p>heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and</p>\n",
        "<p>gnashed her teeth.</p>\n<p>And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were</p>\n<p>the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the</p>\n<p>strangers and destroy them.</p>\n<p>The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were</p>\n<p>told.</p>\n<p>So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the</p>\n<p>Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies</p>\n<p>were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.</p>\n<p>When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a</p>\n<p>strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to</p>\n<p>think what she should do next.</p>\n<p>She could not understand how all her</p>\n",
        "<p>plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful</p>\n<p>Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to</p>\n<p>act.</p>\n<p>There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and</p>\n<p>rubies running round it.</p>\n<p>This Golden Cap had a charm.</p>\n<p>Whoever owned it</p>\n",
        "<p>could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any</p>\n<p>order they were given.</p>\n<p>But no person could command these strange</p>\n<p>creatures more than three times.</p>\n<p>Twice already the Wicked Witch had</p>\n<p>used the charm of the Cap.</p>\n<p>Once was when she had made the Winkies her</p>\n",
        "<p>slaves, and set herself to rule over their country.</p>\n<p>The Winged Monkeys</p>\n<p>had helped her do this.</p>\n<p>The second time was when she had fought against</p>\n<p>the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this.</p>\n",
        "<p>Only once more could</p>\n<p>she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so</p>\n<p>until all her other powers were exhausted.</p>\n<p>But now that her fierce</p>\n<p>wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her</p>\n<p>slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was</p>\n<p>only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.</p>\n",
        "<p>So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it</p>\n<p>upon her head.</p>\n<p>Then she stood upon her left foot and said, slowly:</p>\n<p>“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”</p>\n<p>Next she stood upon her right foot and said:</p>\n<p>“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”</p>\n<p>After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”</p>\n<p>Now the charm began to work.</p>\n<p>The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling</p>\n<p>sound was heard in the air.</p>\n<p>There was a rushing of many wings, a great</p>\n<p>chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show</p>\n<p>the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of</p>\n",
        "<p>immense and powerful wings on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader.</p>\n<p>He flew</p>\n<p>close to the Witch and said, “You have called us for the third and last</p>\n<p>time.</p>\n<p>What do you command?”</p>\n<p>“Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except</p>\n",
        "<p>the Lion,” said the Wicked Witch.</p>\n<p>“Bring that beast to me, for I have a</p>\n<p>mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.”</p>\n<p>“Your commands shall be obeyed,” said the leader.</p>\n<p>Then, with a great</p>\n<p>deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place</p>\n<p>where Dorothy and her friends were walking.</p>\n",
        "<p>Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the</p>\n<p>air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.</p>\n<p>Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the</p>\n<p>rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move</p>\n<p>nor groan.</p>\n<p>Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers</p>\n<p>pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head.</p>\n",
        "<p>They made his hat</p>\n<p>and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top</p>\n<p>branches of a tall tree.</p>\n<p>The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and</p>\n<p>wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable</p>\n<p>to bite or scratch or struggle in any way.</p>\n<p>Then they lifted him up and</p>\n",
        "<p>flew away with him to the Witch’s castle, where he was placed in a</p>\n<p>small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not</p>\n<p>escape.</p>\n<p>But Dorothy they did not harm at all.</p>\n<p>She stood, with Toto in her arms,</p>\n<p>watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her</p>\n<p>turn.</p>\n",
        "<p>The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy</p>\n<p>arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the</p>\n<p>mark of the Good Witch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short,</p>\n<p>motioning the others not to touch her.</p>\n<p>“We dare not harm this little girl,” he said to them, “for she is</p>\n<p>protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of</p>\n<p>Evil.</p>\n",
        "<p>All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch</p>\n<p>and leave her there.”</p>\n<p>So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried</p>\n<p>her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they</p>\n<p>set her down upon the front doorstep.</p>\n<p>Then the leader said to the</p>\n<p>Witch:</p>\n",
        "<p>“We have obeyed you as far as we were able.</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman and the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms.</p>\n<p>Your</p>\n<p>power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and</p>\n<p>noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.</p>\n<p>The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark</p>\n<p>on Dorothy’s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged</p>\n<p>Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way.</p>\n<p>She looked</p>\n<p>down at Dorothy’s feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble</p>\n",
        "<p>with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them.</p>\n<p>At</p>\n<p>first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened</p>\n<p>to look into the child’s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them</p>\n<p>was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the</p>\n<p>Silver Shoes gave her.</p>\n<p>So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and</p>\n",
        "<p>thought, “I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to</p>\n<p>use her power.” Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:</p>\n<p>“Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you</p>\n<p>do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle</p>\n<p>until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots</p>\n",
        "<p>and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.</p>\n<p>Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as</p>\n<p>she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the</p>\n<p>courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse</p>\n<p>her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to</p>\n",
        "<p>go to drive.</p>\n<p>But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and</p>\n<p>bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and</p>\n<p>shut the gate again.</p>\n<p>“If I cannot harness you,” said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through</p>\n<p>the bars of the gate, “I can starve you.</p>\n<p>You shall have nothing to eat</p>\n",
        "<p>until you do as I wish.”</p>\n<p>So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day</p>\n<p>she came to the gate at noon and asked, “Are you ready to be harnessed</p>\n<p>like a horse?”</p>\n<p>And the Lion would answer, “No.</p>\n<p>If you come in this yard, I will bite</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that</p>\n<p>every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from</p>\n<p>the cupboard.</p>\n<p>After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,</p>\n<p>and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy</p>\n<p>mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to</p>\n<p>escape.</p>\n",
        "<p>But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was</p>\n<p>constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the</p>\n<p>Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.</p>\n<p>The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch</p>\n<p>threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in</p>\n<p>her hand.</p>\n<p>But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of</p>\n",
        "<p>the mark upon her forehead.</p>\n<p>The child did not know this, and was full</p>\n<p>of fear for herself and Toto.</p>\n<p>Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with</p>\n<p>her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in</p>\n<p>return.</p>\n<p>The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so</p>\n",
        "<p>wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.</p>\n<p>Dorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would</p>\n<p>be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again.</p>\n<p>Sometimes</p>\n<p>she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and</p>\n<p>looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for</p>\n<p>his little mistress.</p>\n",
        "<p>Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas</p>\n<p>or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the</p>\n<p>little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.</p>\n<p>Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver</p>\n<p>Shoes which the girl always wore.</p>\n<p>Her bees and her crows and her wolves</p>\n<p>were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of</p>\n",
        "<p>the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,</p>\n<p>they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.</p>\n<p>She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,</p>\n<p>thinking she might steal them.</p>\n<p>But the child was so proud of her pretty</p>\n<p>shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took</p>\n<p>her bath.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in</p>\n<p>Dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was</p>\n<p>greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy</p>\n<p>was bathing.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let</p>\n<p>water touch her in any way.</p>\n<p>But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a</p>\n",
        "<p>trick that would give her what she wanted.</p>\n<p>She placed a bar of iron in</p>\n<p>the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the</p>\n<p>iron invisible to human eyes.</p>\n<p>So that when Dorothy walked across the</p>\n<p>floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at</p>\n<p>full length.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver</p>\n<p>Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched</p>\n<p>it away and put it on her own skinny foot.</p>\n<p>The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for</p>\n<p>as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their</p>\n<p>charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how</p>\n<p>to do so.</p>\n",
        "<p>The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew</p>\n<p>angry, and said to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!”</p>\n<p>“I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and not</p>\n<p>yours.”</p>\n<p>“You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“You have no right to take</p>\n<p>my shoe from me.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her, “and</p>\n<p>someday I shall get the other one from you, too.”</p>\n<p>This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water</p>\n<p>that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to</p>\n<p>foot.</p>\n<p>Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as</p>\n<p>Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall</p>\n",
        "<p>away.</p>\n<p>“See what you have done!” she screamed.</p>\n<p>“In a minute I shall melt</p>\n<p>away.”</p>\n<p>“I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see</p>\n<p>the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.</p>\n<p>“Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked the Witch, in a</p>\n",
        "<p>wailing, despairing voice.</p>\n<p>“Of course not,” answered Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“How should I?”</p>\n<p>“Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the</p>\n<p>castle to yourself.</p>\n<p>I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a</p>\n<p>little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked</p>\n",
        "<p>deeds.</p>\n<p>Look out—here I go!”</p>\n<p>With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass</p>\n<p>and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor.</p>\n<p>Seeing</p>\n<p>that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket</p>\n<p>of water and threw it over the mess.</p>\n",
        "<p>She then swept it all out the</p>\n<p>door.</p>\n<p>After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of</p>\n<p>the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her</p>\n<p>foot again.</p>\n<p>Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to</p>\n<p>the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had</p>\n",
        "<p>come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange</p>\n<p>land.</p>\n<p>Chapter XIII</p>\n<p>The Rescue</p>\n<p>The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had</p>\n<p>been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate</p>\n<p>of his prison and set him free.</p>\n",
        "<p>They went in together to the castle,</p>\n<p>where Dorothy’s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell</p>\n<p>them that they were no longer slaves.</p>\n<p>There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been</p>\n<p>made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had</p>\n<p>always treated them with great cruelty.</p>\n<p>They kept this day as a</p>\n",
        "<p>holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and</p>\n<p>dancing.</p>\n<p>“If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,”</p>\n<p>said the Lion, “I should be quite happy.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you suppose we could rescue them?” asked the girl anxiously.</p>\n<p>“We can try,” answered the Lion.</p>\n<p>So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to</p>\n",
        "<p>rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted</p>\n<p>to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from</p>\n<p>bondage.</p>\n<p>So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they</p>\n<p>knew the most, and they all started away.</p>\n<p>They traveled that day and</p>\n<p>part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin</p>\n",
        "<p>Woodman lay, all battered and bent.</p>\n<p>His axe was near him, but the blade</p>\n<p>was rusted and the handle broken off short.</p>\n<p>The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to</p>\n<p>the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the</p>\n<p>sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.</p>\n<p>When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Are any of your people tinsmiths?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>Some of us are very good tinsmiths,” they told her.</p>\n<p>“Then bring them to me,” she said.</p>\n<p>And when the tinsmiths came,</p>\n<p>bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, “Can you</p>\n<p>straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into</p>\n",
        "<p>shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?”</p>\n<p>The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that</p>\n<p>they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and</p>\n<p>worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and</p>\n<p>bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body</p>\n",
        "<p>and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into</p>\n<p>his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever.</p>\n<p>To be sure, there</p>\n<p>were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as</p>\n<p>the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.</p>\n<p>When, at last, he walked into Dorothy’s room and thanked her for</p>\n<p>rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy</p>\n",
        "<p>had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his</p>\n<p>joints would not be rusted.</p>\n<p>At the same time her own tears fell thick</p>\n<p>and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears</p>\n<p>did not need to be wiped away.</p>\n<p>As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so</p>\n<p>often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was</p>\n",
        "<p>obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it</p>\n<p>dried.</p>\n<p>“If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,” said the Tin Woodman,</p>\n<p>when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, “I</p>\n<p>should be quite happy.”</p>\n<p>“We must try to find him,” said the girl.</p>\n<p>So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and</p>\n",
        "<p>part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of</p>\n<p>which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow’s clothes.</p>\n<p>It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could</p>\n<p>climb it; but the Woodman said at once, “I’ll chop it down, and then we</p>\n<p>can get the Scarecrow’s clothes.”</p>\n<p>Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,</p>\n<p>another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of</p>\n",
        "<p>solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman’s axe, instead of the old</p>\n<p>broken handle.</p>\n<p>Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed</p>\n<p>and it glistened like burnished silver.</p>\n<p>As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short</p>\n<p>time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow’s clothes</p>\n<p>fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the</p>\n<p>castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold!</p>\n<p>here was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over</p>\n<p>again for saving him.</p>\n<p>Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy</p>\n<p>days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to</p>\n<p>make them comfortable.</p>\n",
        "<p>But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, “We must go back to</p>\n<p>Oz, and claim his promise.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the Woodman, “at last I shall get my heart.”</p>\n<p>“And I shall get my brains,” added the Scarecrow joyfully.</p>\n<p>“And I shall get my courage,” said the Lion thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>“And I shall get back to Kansas,” cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.</p>\n<p>“Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!”</p>\n",
        "<p>This they decided to do.</p>\n<p>The next day they called the Winkies together</p>\n<p>and bade them good-bye.</p>\n<p>The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and</p>\n<p>they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay</p>\n<p>and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West.</p>\n<p>Finding they were</p>\n",
        "<p>determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden</p>\n<p>collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with</p>\n<p>diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,</p>\n<p>to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a</p>\n<p>silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.</p>\n<p>Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,</p>\n<p>and all shook hands with them until their arms ached.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy went to the Witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for</p>\n<p>the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap.</p>\n<p>She tried it on her own</p>\n<p>head and found that it fitted her exactly.</p>\n<p>She did not know anything</p>\n<p>about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so</p>\n<p>she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald</p>\n<p>City; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to</p>\n<p>carry with them.</p>\n<p>Chapter XIV</p>\n<p>The Winged Monkeys</p>\n<p>You will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the</p>\n<p>castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the four</p>\n<p>travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so</p>\n<p>sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her.</p>\n<p>It was much harder to</p>\n<p>find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow</p>\n<p>daisies than it was being carried.</p>\n<p>They knew, of course, they must go</p>\n",
        "<p>straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right</p>\n<p>way.</p>\n<p>But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know</p>\n<p>which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were</p>\n<p>lost in the great fields.</p>\n<p>They kept on walking, however, and at night</p>\n<p>the moon came out and shone brightly.</p>\n",
        "<p>So they lay down among the sweet</p>\n<p>smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if</p>\n<p>they were quite sure which way they were going.</p>\n<p>“If we walk far enough,” said Dorothy, “I am sure we shall sometime</p>\n<p>come to some place.”</p>\n",
        "<p>But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but</p>\n<p>the scarlet fields.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.</p>\n<p>“We have surely lost our way,” he said, “and unless we find it again in</p>\n<p>time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.”</p>\n<p>“Nor I my heart,” declared the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me I can</p>\n",
        "<p>scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long</p>\n<p>journey.”</p>\n<p>“You see,” said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, “I haven’t the</p>\n<p>courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.”</p>\n<p>Then Dorothy lost heart.</p>\n<p>She sat down on the grass and looked at her</p>\n<p>companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that</p>\n",
        "<p>for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly</p>\n<p>that flew past his head.</p>\n<p>So he put out his tongue and panted and looked</p>\n<p>at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.</p>\n<p>“Suppose we call the field mice,” she suggested.</p>\n<p>“They could probably</p>\n<p>tell us the way to the Emerald City.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“To be sure they could,” cried the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t we think of</p>\n<p>that before?”</p>\n<p>Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck</p>\n<p>since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her.</p>\n<p>In a few minutes they</p>\n<p>heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came</p>\n",
        "<p>running up to her.</p>\n<p>Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her</p>\n<p>squeaky little voice:</p>\n<p>“What can I do for my friends?”</p>\n<p>“We have lost our way,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Can you tell us where the</p>\n<p>Emerald City is?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Certainly,” answered the Queen; “but it is a great way off, for you</p>\n<p>have had it at your backs all this time.” Then she noticed Dorothy’s</p>\n<p>Golden Cap, and said, “Why don’t you use the charm of the Cap, and call</p>\n<p>the Winged Monkeys to you?</p>\n<p>They will carry you to the City of Oz in</p>\n<p>less than an hour.”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know there was a charm,” answered Dorothy, in surprise.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What</p>\n<p>is it?”</p>\n<p>“It is written inside the Golden Cap,” replied the Queen of the Mice.</p>\n<p>“But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for</p>\n<p>they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.”</p>\n<p>“Won’t they hurt me?” asked the girl anxiously.</p>\n<p>“Oh, no.</p>\n",
        "<p>They must obey the wearer of the Cap.</p>\n<p>Good-bye!” And she</p>\n<p>scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.</p>\n<p>Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon</p>\n<p>the lining.</p>\n<p>These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the</p>\n<p>directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!” she said, standing on her left foot.</p>\n<p>“What did you say?” asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was</p>\n<p>doing.</p>\n<p>“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!” Dorothy went on, standing this time on her</p>\n<p>right foot.</p>\n<p>“Hello!” replied the Tin Woodman calmly.</p>\n<p>“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.</p>\n",
        "<p>This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering</p>\n<p>and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.</p>\n<p>The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, “What is your command?”</p>\n<p>“We wish to go to the Emerald City,” said the child, “and we have lost</p>\n<p>our way.”</p>\n<p>“We will carry you,” replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than</p>\n<p>two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.</p>\n",
        "<p>Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little</p>\n<p>Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to</p>\n<p>bite him.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for</p>\n<p>they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;</p>\n<p>but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air</p>\n<p>quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and</p>\n",
        "<p>woods far below them.</p>\n<p>Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys,</p>\n<p>one of them the King himself.</p>\n<p>They had made a chair of their hands and</p>\n<p>were careful not to hurt her.</p>\n<p>“Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“That is a long story,” answered the King, with a winged laugh; “but as</p>\n",
        "<p>we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you</p>\n<p>about it, if you wish.”</p>\n<p>“I shall be glad to hear it,” she replied.</p>\n<p>“Once,” began the leader, “we were a free people, living happily in the</p>\n<p>great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and</p>\n<p>doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master.</p>\n<p>Perhaps some</p>\n",
        "<p>of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull</p>\n<p>the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing</p>\n<p>nuts at the people who walked in the forest.</p>\n<p>But we were careless and</p>\n<p>happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day.</p>\n<p>This was</p>\n<p>many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this</p>\n",
        "<p>land.</p>\n<p>“There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who</p>\n<p>was also a powerful sorceress.</p>\n<p>All her magic was used to help the</p>\n<p>people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good.</p>\n<p>Her name</p>\n<p>was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great</p>\n",
        "<p>blocks of ruby.</p>\n<p>Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that</p>\n<p>she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much</p>\n<p>too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise.</p>\n<p>At last,</p>\n<p>however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his</p>\n<p>years.</p>\n",
        "<p>Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she</p>\n<p>would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used</p>\n<p>all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any</p>\n<p>woman could wish.</p>\n<p>When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,</p>\n<p>was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly</p>\n<p>beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to</p>\n",
        "<p>make everything ready for the wedding.</p>\n<p>“My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which</p>\n<p>lived in the forest near Gayelette’s palace, and the old fellow loved a</p>\n<p>joke better than a good dinner.</p>\n<p>One day, just before the wedding, my</p>\n<p>grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking</p>\n<p>beside the river.</p>\n",
        "<p>He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and</p>\n<p>purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could</p>\n<p>do.</p>\n<p>At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in</p>\n<p>their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then</p>\n<p>dropped him into the water.</p>\n<p>“‘Swim out, my fine fellow,’ cried my grandfather, ‘and see if the</p>\n",
        "<p>water has spotted your clothes.’ Quelala was much too wise not to swim,</p>\n<p>and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.</p>\n<p>But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and</p>\n<p>velvet all ruined by the river.</p>\n<p>“The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it.</p>\n",
        "<p>She had</p>\n<p>all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that</p>\n<p>their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had</p>\n<p>treated Quelala, and dropped in the river.</p>\n<p>But my grandfather pleaded</p>\n<p>hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings</p>\n<p>tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette</p>\n",
        "<p>finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever</p>\n<p>after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap.</p>\n<p>This</p>\n<p>Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to</p>\n<p>have cost the princess half her kingdom.</p>\n<p>Of course my grandfather and</p>\n<p>all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how</p>\n",
        "<p>it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the</p>\n<p>Golden Cap, whosoever he may be.”</p>\n<p>“And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatly</p>\n<p>interested in the story.</p>\n<p>“Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied the Monkey,</p>\n<p>“he was the first to lay his wishes upon us.</p>\n<p>As his bride could not</p>\n",
        "<p>bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he</p>\n<p>had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never</p>\n<p>again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we</p>\n<p>were all afraid of her.</p>\n<p>“This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the</p>\n<p>hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,</p>\n<p>and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now the</p>\n<p>Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your</p>\n<p>wishes upon us.”</p>\n<p>As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the</p>\n<p>green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them.</p>\n<p>She wondered at</p>\n<p>the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over.</p>\n",
        "<p>The</p>\n<p>strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of</p>\n<p>the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,</p>\n<p>followed by all his band.</p>\n<p>“That was a good ride,” said the little girl.</p>\n<p>“Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,” replied the Lion.</p>\n<p>“How</p>\n",
        "<p>lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!”</p>\n<p>Chapter XV</p>\n<p>The Discovery of Oz, the Terrible</p>\n<p>The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang</p>\n<p>the bell.</p>\n<p>After ringing several times, it was opened by the same</p>\n<p>Guardian of the Gates they had met before.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What!</p>\n<p>are you back again?” he asked, in surprise.</p>\n<p>“Do you not see us?” answered the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.”</p>\n<p>“We did visit her,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“And she let you go again?” asked the man, in wonder.</p>\n<p>“She could not help it, for she is melted,” explained the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Melted!</p>\n<p>Well, that is good news, indeed,” said the man.</p>\n<p>“Who melted</p>\n<p>her?”</p>\n<p>“It was Dorothy,” said the Lion gravely.</p>\n<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from</p>\n<p>the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before.</p>\n<p>Afterward</p>\n<p>they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City.</p>\n<p>When the people</p>\n<p>heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked</p>\n<p>Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed</p>\n",
        "<p>them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.</p>\n<p>The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door,</p>\n<p>but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful</p>\n<p>green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they</p>\n<p>might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.</p>\n<p>The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the</p>\n<p>other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch;</p>\n",
        "<p>but Oz made no reply.</p>\n<p>They thought the Great Wizard would send for them</p>\n<p>at once, but he did not.</p>\n<p>They had no word from him the next day, nor</p>\n<p>the next, nor the next.</p>\n<p>The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at</p>\n<p>last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,</p>\n",
        "<p>after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery.</p>\n<p>So the Scarecrow</p>\n<p>at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if</p>\n<p>he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged</p>\n<p>Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.</p>\n<p>When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he</p>\n<p>sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after</p>\n",
        "<p>nine o’clock the next morning.</p>\n<p>He had once met the Winged Monkeys in</p>\n<p>the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.</p>\n<p>The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift</p>\n<p>Oz had promised to bestow on him.</p>\n<p>Dorothy fell asleep only once, and</p>\n<p>then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how</p>\n",
        "<p>glad she was to have her little girl at home again.</p>\n<p>Promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier</p>\n<p>came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room</p>\n<p>of the Great Oz.</p>\n<p>Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he</p>\n<p>had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about</p>\n<p>and saw no one at all in the room.</p>\n",
        "<p>They kept close to the door and</p>\n<p>closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more</p>\n<p>dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.</p>\n<p>Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere</p>\n<p>near the top of the great dome, and it said:</p>\n<p>“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.</p>\n<p>Why do you seek me?”</p>\n",
        "<p>They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,</p>\n<p>Dorothy asked, “Where are you?”</p>\n<p>“I am everywhere,” answered the Voice, “but to the eyes of common</p>\n<p>mortals I am invisible.</p>\n<p>I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you</p>\n<p>may converse with me.” Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come</p>\n<p>straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in</p>\n",
        "<p>a row while Dorothy said:</p>\n<p>“We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.”</p>\n<p>“What promise?” asked Oz.</p>\n<p>“You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was</p>\n<p>destroyed,” said the girl.</p>\n<p>“And you promised to give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“And you promised to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n",
        "<p>“And you promised to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.</p>\n<p>“Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?” asked the Voice, and Dorothy</p>\n<p>thought it trembled a little.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she answered, “I melted her with a bucket of water.”</p>\n<p>“Dear me,” said the Voice, “how sudden!</p>\n<p>Well, come to me tomorrow, for</p>\n<p>I must have time to think it over.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“You’ve had plenty of time already,” said the Tin Woodman angrily.</p>\n<p>“We shan’t wait a day longer,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“You must keep your promises to us!” exclaimed Dorothy.</p>\n<p>The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave</p>\n<p>a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped</p>\n<p>away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a</p>\n<p>corner.</p>\n",
        "<p>As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next</p>\n<p>moment all of them were filled with wonder.</p>\n<p>For they saw, standing in</p>\n<p>just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head</p>\n<p>and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and</p>\n<p>cried out, “Who are you?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” said the little man, in a trembling</p>\n<p>voice.</p>\n<p>“But don’t strike me—please don’t—and I’ll do anything you want</p>\n<p>me to.”</p>\n<p>Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.</p>\n<p>“I thought Oz was a great Head,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,” exclaimed the Lion.</p>\n<p>“No, you are all wrong,” said the little man meekly.</p>\n<p>“I have been</p>\n<p>making believe.”</p>\n<p>“Making believe!” cried Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Are you not a Great Wizard?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Hush, my dear,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Don’t speak so loud, or you will be</p>\n<p>overheard—and I should be ruined.</p>\n<p>I’m supposed to be a Great Wizard.”</p>\n<p>“And aren’t you?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Not a bit of it, my dear; I’m just a common man.”</p>\n<p>“You’re more than that,” said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; “you’re</p>\n",
        "<p>a humbug.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly so!” declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if</p>\n<p>it pleased him.</p>\n<p>“I am a humbug.”</p>\n<p>“But this is terrible,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“How shall I ever get my</p>\n<p>heart?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Or I my courage?” asked the Lion.</p>\n<p>“Or I my brains?” wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes</p>\n<p>with his coat sleeve.</p>\n<p>“My dear friends,” said Oz, “I pray you not to speak of these little</p>\n<p>things.</p>\n<p>Think of me, and the terrible trouble I’m in at being found</p>\n<p>out.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“No one knows it but you four—and myself,” replied Oz.</p>\n<p>“I have fooled</p>\n<p>everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out.</p>\n<p>It was a</p>\n<p>great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room.</p>\n<p>Usually I will</p>\n",
        "<p>not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.”</p>\n<p>“But, I don’t understand,” said Dorothy, in bewilderment.</p>\n<p>“How was it</p>\n<p>that you appeared to me as a great Head?”</p>\n<p>“That was one of my tricks,” answered Oz.</p>\n<p>“Step this way, please, and I</p>\n<p>will tell you all about it.”</p>\n",
        "<p>He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and</p>\n<p>they all followed him.</p>\n<p>He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great</p>\n<p>Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully</p>\n<p>painted face.</p>\n<p>“This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,” said Oz.</p>\n<p>“I stood behind the</p>\n",
        "<p>screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.”</p>\n<p>“But how about the voice?” she inquired.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I am a ventriloquist,” said the little man.</p>\n<p>“I can throw the sound</p>\n<p>of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of</p>\n<p>the Head.</p>\n<p>Here are the other things I used to deceive you.” He showed</p>\n",
        "<p>the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be</p>\n<p>the lovely Lady.</p>\n<p>And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was</p>\n<p>nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their</p>\n<p>sides out.</p>\n<p>As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also</p>\n<p>from the ceiling.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was</p>\n<p>poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.</p>\n<p>“Really,” said the Scarecrow, “you ought to be ashamed of yourself for</p>\n<p>being such a humbug.”</p>\n<p>“I am—I certainly am,” answered the little man sorrowfully; “but it was</p>\n<p>the only thing I could do.</p>\n<p>Sit down, please, there are plenty of</p>\n",
        "<p>chairs; and I will tell you my story.”</p>\n<p>So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.</p>\n<p>“I was born in Omaha—”</p>\n<p>“Why, that isn’t very far from Kansas!” cried Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“No, but it’s farther from here,” he said, shaking his head at her</p>\n<p>sadly.</p>\n<p>“When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very</p>\n",
        "<p>well trained by a great master.</p>\n<p>I can imitate any kind of a bird or</p>\n<p>beast.” Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears</p>\n<p>and looked everywhere to see where she was.</p>\n<p>“After a time,” continued</p>\n<p>Oz, “I tired of that, and became a balloonist.”</p>\n<p>“What is that?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n",
        "<p>“A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of</p>\n<p>people together and get them to pay to see the circus,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” she said, “I know.”</p>\n<p>“Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so</p>\n<p>that I couldn’t come down again.</p>\n<p>It went way up above the clouds, so</p>\n<p>far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles</p>\n",
        "<p>away.</p>\n<p>For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the</p>\n<p>morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a</p>\n<p>strange and beautiful country.</p>\n<p>“It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit.</p>\n<p>But I found myself</p>\n<p>in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,</p>\n",
        "<p>thought I was a great Wizard.</p>\n<p>Of course I let them think so, because</p>\n<p>they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.</p>\n<p>“Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to</p>\n<p>build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.</p>\n<p>Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call</p>\n<p>it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green</p>\n",
        "<p>spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.”</p>\n<p>“But isn’t everything here green?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“No more than in any other city,” replied Oz; “but when you wear green</p>\n<p>spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man</p>\n<p>when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now.</p>\n",
        "<p>But my</p>\n<p>people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them</p>\n<p>think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful</p>\n<p>place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing</p>\n<p>that is needed to make one happy.</p>\n<p>I have been good to the people, and</p>\n<p>they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself</p>\n",
        "<p>up and would not see any of them.</p>\n<p>“One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical</p>\n<p>powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do</p>\n<p>wonderful things.</p>\n<p>There were four of them in this country, and they</p>\n<p>ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew</p>\n",
        "<p>they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were</p>\n<p>terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they</p>\n<p>themselves, they would surely have destroyed me.</p>\n<p>As it was, I lived in</p>\n<p>deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I</p>\n<p>was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.</p>\n<p>When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would</p>\n",
        "<p>only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I</p>\n<p>am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.”</p>\n<p>“I think you are a very bad man,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Oh, no, my dear; I’m really a very good man, but I’m a very bad</p>\n<p>Wizard, I must admit.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you give me brains?” asked the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need them.</p>\n",
        "<p>You are learning something every day.</p>\n<p>A baby has</p>\n<p>brains, but it doesn’t know much.</p>\n<p>Experience is the only thing that</p>\n<p>brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience</p>\n<p>you are sure to get.”</p>\n<p>“That may all be true,” said the Scarecrow, “but I shall be very</p>\n",
        "<p>unhappy unless you give me brains.”</p>\n<p>The false Wizard looked at him carefully.</p>\n<p>“Well,” he said with a sigh, “I’m not much of a magician, as I said;</p>\n<p>but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head</p>\n<p>with brains.</p>\n<p>I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find</p>\n<p>that out for yourself.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh, thank you—thank you!” cried the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“I’ll find a way to use</p>\n<p>them, never fear!”</p>\n<p>“But how about my courage?” asked the Lion anxiously.</p>\n<p>“You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz.</p>\n<p>“All you need is</p>\n<p>confidence in yourself.</p>\n",
        "<p>There is no living thing that is not afraid</p>\n<p>when it faces danger.</p>\n<p>The True courage is in facing danger when you are</p>\n<p>afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps I have, but I’m scared just the same,” said the Lion.</p>\n<p>“I shall</p>\n<p>really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that</p>\n",
        "<p>makes one forget he is afraid.”</p>\n<p>“Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,” replied Oz.</p>\n<p>“How about my heart?” asked the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“Why, as for that,” answered Oz, “I think you are wrong to want a</p>\n<p>heart.</p>\n<p>It makes most people unhappy.</p>\n<p>If you only knew it, you are in</p>\n",
        "<p>luck not to have a heart.”</p>\n<p>“That must be a matter of opinion,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“For my part,</p>\n<p>I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me</p>\n<p>the heart.”</p>\n<p>“Very well,” answered Oz meekly.</p>\n<p>“Come to me tomorrow and you shall</p>\n",
        "<p>have a heart.</p>\n<p>I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well</p>\n<p>continue the part a little longer.”</p>\n<p>“And now,” said Dorothy, “how am I to get back to Kansas?”</p>\n<p>“We shall have to think about that,” replied the little man.</p>\n<p>“Give me</p>\n<p>two or three days to consider the matter and I’ll try to find a way to</p>\n",
        "<p>carry you over the desert.</p>\n<p>In the meantime you shall all be treated as</p>\n<p>my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon</p>\n<p>you and obey your slightest wish.</p>\n<p>There is only one thing I ask in</p>\n<p>return for my help—such as it is.</p>\n<p>You must keep my secret and tell no</p>\n",
        "<p>one I am a humbug.”</p>\n<p>They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to</p>\n<p>their rooms in high spirits.</p>\n<p>Even Dorothy had hope that “The Great and</p>\n<p>Terrible Humbug,” as she called him, would find a way to send her back</p>\n<p>to Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.</p>\n<p>Chapter XVI</p>\n",
        "<p>The Magic Art of the Great Humbug</p>\n<p>Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:</p>\n<p>“Congratulate me.</p>\n<p>I am going to Oz to get my brains at last.</p>\n<p>When I</p>\n<p>return I shall be as other men are.”</p>\n<p>“I have always liked you as you were,” said Dorothy simply.</p>\n",
        "<p>“It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,” he replied.</p>\n<p>“But surely you</p>\n<p>will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain</p>\n<p>is going to turn out.” Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful</p>\n<p>voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.</p>\n<p>“Come in,” said Oz.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the</p>\n",
        "<p>window, engaged in deep thought.</p>\n<p>“I have come for my brains,” remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,” replied Oz.</p>\n<p>“You must excuse</p>\n<p>me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put</p>\n<p>your brains in their proper place.”</p>\n<p>“That’s all right,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You are quite welcome to take</p>\n<p>my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on</p>\n<p>again.”</p>\n<p>So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw.</p>\n<p>Then he</p>\n<p>entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed</p>\n<p>with a great many pins and needles.</p>\n",
        "<p>Having shaken them together</p>\n<p>thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow’s head with the mixture</p>\n<p>and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.</p>\n<p>When he had fastened the Scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to</p>\n<p>him, “Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of</p>\n<p>bran-new brains.”</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his</p>\n",
        "<p>greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his</p>\n<p>friends.</p>\n<p>Dorothy looked at him curiously.</p>\n<p>His head was quite bulged out at the</p>\n<p>top with brains.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“I feel wise indeed,” he answered earnestly.</p>\n",
        "<p>“When I get used to my</p>\n<p>brains I shall know everything.”</p>\n<p>“Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?” asked the</p>\n<p>Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“That is proof that he is sharp,” remarked the Lion.</p>\n<p>“Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,” said the Woodman.</p>\n<p>So he</p>\n",
        "<p>walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.</p>\n<p>“Come in,” called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, “I have come</p>\n<p>for my heart.”</p>\n<p>“Very well,” answered the little man.</p>\n<p>“But I shall have to cut a hole</p>\n<p>in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place.</p>\n<p>I hope it</p>\n",
        "<p>won’t hurt you.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” answered the Woodman.</p>\n<p>“I shall not feel it at all.”</p>\n<p>So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small, square hole</p>\n<p>in the left side of the Tin Woodman’s breast.</p>\n<p>Then, going to a chest of</p>\n<p>drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed</p>\n",
        "<p>with sawdust.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t it a beauty?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased.</p>\n<p>“But is</p>\n<p>it a kind heart?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, very!” answered Oz.</p>\n<p>He put the heart in the Woodman’s breast and</p>\n",
        "<p>then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it</p>\n<p>had been cut.</p>\n<p>“There,” said he; “now you have a heart that any man might be proud of.</p>\n<p>I’m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn’t</p>\n<p>be helped.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind the patch,” exclaimed the happy Woodman.</p>\n<p>“I am very</p>\n",
        "<p>grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t speak of it,” replied Oz.</p>\n<p>Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy</p>\n<p>on account of his good fortune.</p>\n<p>The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.</p>\n<p>“Come in,” said Oz.</p>\n<p>“I have come for my courage,” announced the Lion, entering the room.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Very well,” answered the little man; “I will get it for you.”</p>\n<p>He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a</p>\n<p>square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold</p>\n<p>dish, beautifully carved.</p>\n<p>Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who</p>\n<p>sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:</p>\n<p>“Drink.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“What is it?” asked the Lion.</p>\n<p>“Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would be courage.</p>\n<p>You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this</p>\n<p>really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it.</p>\n<p>Therefore</p>\n<p>I advise you to drink it as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p>The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.</p>\n",
        "<p>“How do you feel now?” asked Oz.</p>\n<p>“Full of courage,” replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his</p>\n<p>friends to tell them of his good fortune.</p>\n<p>Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought</p>\n<p>they wanted.</p>\n<p>“How can I help being a humbug,” he said, “when all these</p>\n",
        "<p>people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done?</p>\n<p>It was</p>\n<p>easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because</p>\n<p>they imagined I could do anything.</p>\n<p>But it will take more than</p>\n<p>imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I’m sure I don’t know</p>\n<p>how it can be done.”</p>\n",
        "<h3>Chapter XVII</h3>\n<p>How the Balloon Was Launched</p>\n<p>For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz.</p>\n<p>These were sad days for</p>\n<p>the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and</p>\n<p>contented.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his</p>\n",
        "<p>head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could</p>\n<p>understand them but himself.</p>\n<p>When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt</p>\n<p>his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had</p>\n<p>discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had</p>\n<p>owned when he was made of flesh.</p>\n<p>The Lion declared he was afraid of</p>\n",
        "<p>nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the</p>\n<p>fierce Kalidahs.</p>\n<p>Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed</p>\n<p>more than ever to get back to Kansas.</p>\n<p>On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she</p>\n<p>entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:</p>\n<p>“Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this</p>\n",
        "<p>country.”</p>\n<p>“And back to Kansas?” she asked eagerly.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not sure about Kansas,” said Oz, “for I haven’t the faintest</p>\n<p>notion which way it lies.</p>\n<p>But the first thing to do is to cross the</p>\n<p>desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.”</p>\n<p>“How can I cross the desert?” she inquired.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what I think,” said the little man.</p>\n<p>“You see, when</p>\n<p>I came to this country it was in a balloon.</p>\n<p>You also came through the</p>\n<p>air, being carried by a cyclone.</p>\n<p>So I believe the best way to get</p>\n<p>across the desert will be through the air.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now, it is quite beyond my</p>\n<p>powers to make a cyclone; but I’ve been thinking the matter over, and I</p>\n<p>believe I can make a balloon.”</p>\n<p>“How?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated with glue to</p>\n<p>keep the gas in it.</p>\n<p>I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be</p>\n",
        "<p>no trouble to make the balloon.</p>\n<p>But in all this country there is no gas</p>\n<p>to fill the balloon with, to make it float.”</p>\n<p>“If it won’t float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be of no use to us.”</p>\n<p>“True,” answered Oz.</p>\n<p>“But there is another way to make it float, which</p>\n<p>is to fill it with hot air.</p>\n",
        "<p>Hot air isn’t as good as gas, for if the</p>\n<p>air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we</p>\n<p>should be lost.”</p>\n<p>“We!” exclaimed the girl.</p>\n<p>“Are you going with me?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, of course,” replied Oz.</p>\n<p>“I am tired of being such a humbug.</p>\n",
        "<p>If I</p>\n<p>should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a</p>\n<p>Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.</p>\n<p>So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.</p>\n<p>I’d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”</p>\n<p>“I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” he answered.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Now, if you will help me sew the silk</p>\n<p>together, we will begin to work on our balloon.”</p>\n<p>So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips</p>\n<p>of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together.</p>\n<p>First</p>\n<p>there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and</p>\n<p>then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon</p>\n",
        "<p>in different shades of the color about them.</p>\n<p>It took three days to sew</p>\n<p>all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of</p>\n<p>green silk more than twenty feet long.</p>\n<p>Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it</p>\n<p>airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.</p>\n<p>“But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said.</p>\n",
        "<p>So he sent the soldier</p>\n<p>with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened</p>\n<p>with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.</p>\n<p>When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to</p>\n<p>make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the</p>\n",
        "<p>wonderful sight.</p>\n<p>Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the</p>\n<p>people gazed upon it with much curiosity.</p>\n<p>The Tin Woodman had chopped a</p>\n<p>big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom</p>\n<p>of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it</p>\n<p>would be caught in the silken bag.</p>\n",
        "<p>Gradually the balloon swelled out</p>\n<p>and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the</p>\n<p>ground.</p>\n<p>Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:</p>\n<p>“I am now going away to make a visit.</p>\n<p>While I am gone the Scarecrow</p>\n<p>will rule over you.</p>\n",
        "<p>I command you to obey him as you would me.”</p>\n<p>The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to</p>\n<p>the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much</p>\n<p>lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into</p>\n<p>the sky.</p>\n<p>“Come, Dorothy!” cried the Wizard.</p>\n<p>“Hurry up, or the balloon will fly</p>\n",
        "<p>away.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t find Toto anywhere,” replied Dorothy, who did not wish to</p>\n<p>leave her little dog behind.</p>\n<p>Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a</p>\n<p>kitten, and Dorothy at last found him.</p>\n<p>She picked him up and ran</p>\n<p>towards the balloon.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to</p>\n<p>help her into the basket, when, crack!</p>\n<p>went the ropes, and the balloon</p>\n<p>rose into the air without her.</p>\n<p>“Come back!” she screamed.</p>\n<p>“I want to go, too!”</p>\n<p>“I can’t come back, my dear,” called Oz from the basket.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Good-bye!”</p>\n<p>“Good-bye!” shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where</p>\n<p>the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and</p>\n<p>farther into the sky.</p>\n<p>And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard,</p>\n<p>though he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we</p>\n<p>know.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:</p>\n<p>“Oz was always our friend.</p>\n<p>When he was here he built for us this</p>\n<p>beautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise</p>\n<p>Scarecrow to rule over us.”</p>\n<p>Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful</p>\n<p>Wizard, and would not be comforted.</p>\n",
        "<h3>Chapter XVIII</h3>\n<p>Away to the South</p>\n<p>Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas</p>\n<p>again; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone</p>\n<p>up in a balloon.</p>\n<p>And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her</p>\n<p>companions.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Tin Woodman came to her and said:</p>\n<p>“Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave</p>\n<p>me my lovely heart.</p>\n<p>I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone,</p>\n<p>if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.”</p>\n<p>“With pleasure,” she answered, and brought a towel at once.</p>\n<p>Then the</p>\n",
        "<p>Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears</p>\n<p>carefully and wiped them away with the towel.</p>\n<p>When he had finished, he</p>\n<p>thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled</p>\n<p>oil-can, to guard against mishap.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he</p>\n<p>was not a Wizard the people were proud of him.</p>\n",
        "<p>“For,” they said, “there</p>\n<p>is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.”</p>\n<p>And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.</p>\n<p>The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers</p>\n<p>met in the Throne Room and talked matters over.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow sat in</p>\n<p>the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.</p>\n",
        "<p>“We are not so unlucky,” said the new ruler, “for this Palace and the</p>\n<p>Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please.</p>\n<p>When I</p>\n<p>remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer’s</p>\n<p>cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am</p>\n<p>quite satisfied with my lot.”</p>\n<p>“I also,” said the Tin Woodman, “am well-pleased with my new heart;</p>\n",
        "<p>and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.”</p>\n<p>“For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that</p>\n<p>ever lived, if not braver,” said the Lion modestly.</p>\n<p>“If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,”</p>\n<p>continued the Scarecrow, “we might all be happy together.”</p>\n<p>“But I don’t want to live here,” cried Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“I want to go to</p>\n",
        "<p>Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then, what can be done?” inquired the Woodman.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins</p>\n<p>and needles began to stick out of his brains.</p>\n<p>Finally he said:</p>\n<p>“Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the</p>\n<p>desert?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I never thought of that!” said Dorothy joyfully.</p>\n<p>“It’s just the thing.</p>\n<p>I’ll go at once for the Golden Cap.”</p>\n<p>When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and</p>\n<p>soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and</p>\n<p>stood beside her.</p>\n<p>“This is the second time you have called us,” said the Monkey King,</p>\n",
        "<p>bowing before the little girl.</p>\n<p>“What do you wish?”</p>\n<p>“I want you to fly with me to Kansas,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>But the Monkey King shook his head.</p>\n<p>“That cannot be done,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We belong to this country alone, and</p>\n<p>cannot leave it.</p>\n",
        "<p>There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,</p>\n<p>and I suppose there never will be, for they don’t belong there.</p>\n<p>We</p>\n<p>shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross</p>\n<p>the desert.</p>\n<p>Good-bye.”</p>\n<p>And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away</p>\n",
        "<p>through the window, followed by all his band.</p>\n<p>Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment.</p>\n<p>“I have wasted the charm</p>\n<p>of the Golden Cap to no purpose,” she said, “for the Winged Monkeys</p>\n<p>cannot help me.”</p>\n<p>“It is certainly too bad!” said the tender-hearted Woodman.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly</p>\n",
        "<p>that Dorothy feared it would burst.</p>\n<p>“Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said, “and ask</p>\n<p>his advice.”</p>\n<p>So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for</p>\n<p>while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.</p>\n<p>“This little girl,” said the Scarecrow to the soldier, “wishes to cross</p>\n<p>the desert.</p>\n",
        "<p>How can she do so?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot tell,” answered the soldier, “for nobody has ever crossed the</p>\n<p>desert, unless it is Oz himself.”</p>\n<p>“Is there no one who can help me?” asked Dorothy earnestly.</p>\n<p>“Glinda might,” he suggested.</p>\n<p>“Who is Glinda?” inquired the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“The Witch of the South.</p>\n",
        "<p>She is the most powerful of all the Witches,</p>\n<p>and rules over the Quadlings.</p>\n<p>Besides, her castle stands on the edge of</p>\n<p>the desert, so she may know a way to cross it.”</p>\n<p>“Glinda is a Good Witch, isn’t she?” asked the child.</p>\n<p>“The Quadlings think she is good,” said the soldier, “and she is kind</p>\n<p>to everyone.</p>\n",
        "<p>I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows</p>\n<p>how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.”</p>\n<p>“How can I get to her castle?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“The road is straight to the South,” he answered, “but it is said to be</p>\n<p>full of dangers to travelers.</p>\n<p>There are wild beasts in the woods, and a</p>\n<p>race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country.</p>\n",
        "<p>For</p>\n<p>this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.”</p>\n<p>The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:</p>\n<p>“It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is</p>\n<p>to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her.</p>\n<p>For, of</p>\n<p>course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“You must have been thinking again,” remarked the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“I have,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“I shall go with Dorothy,” declared the Lion, “for I am tired of your</p>\n<p>city and long for the woods and the country again.</p>\n<p>I am really a wild</p>\n<p>beast, you know.</p>\n<p>Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“That is true,” agreed the Woodman.</p>\n<p>“My axe may be of service to her;</p>\n<p>so I also will go with her to the Land of the South.”</p>\n<p>“When shall we start?” asked the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“Are you going?” they asked, in surprise.</p>\n<p>“Certainly.</p>\n<p>If it wasn’t for Dorothy I should never have had brains.</p>\n",
        "<p>She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the</p>\n<p>Emerald City.</p>\n<p>So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never</p>\n<p>leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” said Dorothy gratefully.</p>\n<p>“You are all very kind to me.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n",
        "<p>I should like to start as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p>“We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“So now let us</p>\n<p>all get ready, for it will be a long journey.”</p>\n<p>Chapter XIX</p>\n<p>Attacked by the Fighting Trees</p>\n<p>The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and</p>\n",
        "<p>they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had</p>\n<p>walked with them as far as the gate.</p>\n<p>When the Guardian of the Gate saw</p>\n<p>them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City</p>\n<p>to get into new trouble.</p>\n<p>But he at once unlocked their spectacles,</p>\n<p>which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to</p>\n",
        "<p>carry with them.</p>\n<p>“You are now our ruler,” he said to the Scarecrow; “so you must come</p>\n<p>back to us as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p>“I certainly shall if I am able,” the Scarecrow replied; “but I must</p>\n<p>help Dorothy to get home, first.”</p>\n<p>As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:</p>\n<p>“I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has</p>\n",
        "<p>been good to me.</p>\n<p>I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t try, my dear,” he answered.</p>\n<p>“We should like to keep you with us,</p>\n<p>but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a</p>\n<p>way.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth</p>\n<p>and started upon their journey.</p>\n",
        "<p>The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the</p>\n<p>Land of the South.</p>\n<p>They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed</p>\n<p>and chatted together.</p>\n<p>Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of</p>\n<p>getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of</p>\n<p>use to her.</p>\n",
        "<p>As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and</p>\n<p>whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country</p>\n<p>again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies,</p>\n<p>barking merrily all the time.</p>\n<p>“City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, as they</p>\n<p>walked along at a brisk pace.</p>\n<p>“I have lost much flesh since I lived</p>\n",
        "<p>there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how</p>\n<p>courageous I have grown.”</p>\n<p>They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City.</p>\n<p>All they</p>\n<p>could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and</p>\n<p>high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.</p>\n<p>“Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, as he</p>\n",
        "<p>felt his heart rattling around in his breast.</p>\n<p>“He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,” said the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,” added the</p>\n<p>Lion, “he would have been a brave man.”</p>\n<p>Dorothy said nothing.</p>\n<p>Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he</p>\n",
        "<p>had done his best, so she forgave him.</p>\n<p>As he said, he was a good man,</p>\n<p>even if he was a bad Wizard.</p>\n<p>The first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers</p>\n<p>that stretched about the Emerald City on every side.</p>\n<p>They slept that</p>\n<p>night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they</p>\n",
        "<p>rested very well indeed.</p>\n<p>In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood.</p>\n<p>There</p>\n<p>was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and</p>\n<p>left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change</p>\n<p>the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost.</p>\n<p>So they looked</p>\n",
        "<p>for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with</p>\n<p>such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass</p>\n<p>underneath.</p>\n<p>So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under</p>\n<p>the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next</p>\n<p>minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his</p>\n",
        "<p>fellow travelers.</p>\n<p>This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked</p>\n<p>rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.</p>\n<p>“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.</p>\n<p>“Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for it doesn’t hurt me to</p>\n<p>get thrown about.” He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its</p>\n<p>branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.</p>\n",
        "<p>“This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“What shall we do?”</p>\n<p>“The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our</p>\n<p>journey,” remarked the Lion.</p>\n<p>“I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shouldering his</p>\n<p>axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so</p>\n<p>roughly.</p>\n",
        "<p>When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped</p>\n<p>at it so fiercely that he cut it in two.</p>\n<p>At once the tree began shaking</p>\n<p>all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>“Come on!” he shouted to the others.</p>\n<p>“Be quick!” They all ran forward</p>\n",
        "<p>and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught</p>\n<p>by a small branch and shaken until he howled.</p>\n<p>But the Woodman promptly</p>\n<p>chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.</p>\n<p>The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they</p>\n<p>made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down</p>\n<p>their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the</p>\n",
        "<p>forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out</p>\n<p>of it.</p>\n<p>The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came</p>\n<p>to the farther edge of the wood.</p>\n<p>Then, to their surprise, they found</p>\n<p>before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china.</p>\n<p>It was</p>\n",
        "<p>smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.</p>\n<p>“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for we certainly must</p>\n<p>climb over the wall.”</p>\n<p>Chapter XX</p>\n<p>The Dainty China Country</p>\n<p>While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the</p>\n",
        "<p>forest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk.</p>\n<p>The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:</p>\n<p>“I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.”</p>\n<p>“Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied the</p>\n<p>Woodman.</p>\n<p>“When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the</p>\n",
        "<p>other side.”</p>\n<p>After a time the ladder was finished.</p>\n<p>It looked clumsy, but the Tin</p>\n<p>Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the</p>\n<p>ladder was ready.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was</p>\n<p>so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from</p>\n<p>falling off.</p>\n<p>When he got his head over the top of the wall the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow said, “Oh, my!”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy.</p>\n<p>So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the</p>\n",
        "<p>wall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, “Oh, my!” just as the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow had done.</p>\n<p>Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him</p>\n<p>be still.</p>\n<p>The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but</p>\n<p>both of them cried, “Oh, my!” as soon as they looked over the wall.</p>\n<p>When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked</p>\n",
        "<p>down and saw a strange sight.</p>\n<p>Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and</p>\n<p>shining and white as the bottom of a big platter.</p>\n<p>Scattered around were</p>\n<p>many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.</p>\n<p>These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as</p>\n<p>high as Dorothy’s waist.</p>\n",
        "<p>There were also pretty little barns, with</p>\n<p>china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs</p>\n<p>and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.</p>\n<p>But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer</p>\n<p>country.</p>\n<p>There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored</p>\n<p>bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most</p>\n",
        "<p>gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in</p>\n<p>knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and</p>\n<p>golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon</p>\n<p>their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns</p>\n<p>in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,</p>\n<p>pointed caps.</p>\n<p>And, strangest of all, these people were all made of</p>\n",
        "<p>china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of</p>\n<p>them was no higher than Dorothy’s knee.</p>\n<p>No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little</p>\n<p>purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and</p>\n<p>barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.</p>\n<p>“How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy.</p>\n<p>They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the</p>\n",
        "<p>Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that</p>\n<p>the hard floor would not hurt their feet.</p>\n<p>Of course they took pains not</p>\n<p>to light on his head and get the pins in their feet.</p>\n<p>When all were</p>\n<p>safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite</p>\n<p>flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.</p>\n",
        "<p>“We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,”</p>\n<p>said Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except</p>\n<p>due South.”</p>\n<p>They began walking through the country of the china people, and the</p>\n<p>first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow.</p>\n<p>As</p>\n<p>they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,</p>\n",
        "<p>the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china</p>\n<p>ground with a great clatter.</p>\n<p>Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and</p>\n<p>that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor</p>\n<p>milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.</p>\n<p>“There!” cried the milkmaid angrily.</p>\n<p>“See what you have done!</p>\n",
        "<p>My cow</p>\n<p>has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender’s shop and have</p>\n<p>it glued on again.</p>\n<p>What do you mean by coming here and frightening my</p>\n<p>cow?”</p>\n<p>“I’m very sorry,” returned Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Please forgive us.”</p>\n",
        "<p>But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping</p>\n<p>on three legs.</p>\n<p>As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful</p>\n<p>glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked</p>\n<p>elbow close to her side.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.</p>\n<p>“We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman, “or we</p>\n<p>may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.”</p>\n<p>A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young</p>\n<p>Princess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run</p>\n<p>away.</p>\n<p>Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her.</p>\n",
        "<p>But</p>\n<p>the china girl cried out:</p>\n<p>“Don’t chase me!</p>\n<p>Don’t chase me!”</p>\n<p>She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,</p>\n<p>“Why not?”</p>\n<p>“Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,</p>\n",
        "<p>“if I run I may fall down and break myself.”</p>\n<p>“But could you not be mended?” asked the girl.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,”</p>\n<p>replied the Princess.</p>\n<p>“I suppose not,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“Now there is Mr.</p>\n<p>Joker, one of our clowns,” continued the china lady,</p>\n",
        "<p>“who is always trying to stand upon his head.</p>\n<p>He has broken himself so</p>\n<p>often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn’t look at all</p>\n<p>pretty.</p>\n<p>Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy</p>\n<p>could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and</p>\n",
        "<p>green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way</p>\n<p>and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.</p>\n<p>The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his</p>\n<p>cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:</p>\n<p>“My lady fair,</p>\n<p>Why do you stare</p>\n<p>At poor old Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Joker?</p>\n<p>You’re quite as stiff</p>\n<p>And prim as if</p>\n<p>You’d eaten up a poker!”</p>\n<p>“Be quiet, sir!” said the Princess.</p>\n<p>“Can’t you see these are strangers,</p>\n<p>and should be treated with respect?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well, that’s respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, and immediately</p>\n<p>stood upon his head.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind Mr.</p>\n<p>Joker,” said the Princess to Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“He is</p>\n<p>considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I don’t mind him a bit,” said Dorothy.</p>\n",
        "<p>“But you are so beautiful,”</p>\n<p>she continued, “that I am sure I could love you dearly.</p>\n<p>Won’t you let</p>\n<p>me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em’s mantel?</p>\n<p>I could</p>\n<p>carry you in my basket.”</p>\n<p>“That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You</p>\n<p>see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move</p>\n<p>around as we please.</p>\n<p>But whenever any of us are taken away our joints</p>\n<p>at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty.</p>\n<p>Of</p>\n<p>course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and</p>\n",
        "<p>cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter</p>\n<p>here in our own country.”</p>\n<p>“I would not make you unhappy for all the world!” exclaimed Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“So I’ll just say good-bye.”</p>\n<p>“Good-bye,” replied the Princess.</p>\n<p>They walked carefully through the china country.</p>\n<p>The little animals and</p>\n",
        "<p>all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would</p>\n<p>break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other</p>\n<p>side of the country and came to another china wall.</p>\n<p>It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the</p>\n<p>Lion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top.</p>\n<p>Then the Lion</p>\n<p>gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he</p>\n",
        "<p>jumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to</p>\n<p>pieces.</p>\n<p>“That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we were lucky in</p>\n<p>not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s leg and a</p>\n<p>church.</p>\n<p>They are all so brittle!”</p>\n<p>“They are, indeed,” said the Scarecrow, “and I am thankful I am made of</p>\n",
        "<p>straw and cannot be easily damaged.</p>\n<p>There are worse things in the world</p>\n<p>than being a Scarecrow.”</p>\n<p>Chapter XXI</p>\n<p>The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts</p>\n<p>After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves</p>\n<p>in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with</p>\n",
        "<p>tall, rank grass.</p>\n<p>It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy</p>\n<p>holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight.</p>\n<p>However,</p>\n<p>by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they</p>\n<p>reached solid ground.</p>\n<p>But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and</p>\n",
        "<p>after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered</p>\n<p>another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had</p>\n<p>ever seen.</p>\n<p>“This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, looking</p>\n<p>around him with joy.</p>\n<p>“Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”</p>\n<p>“It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion.</p>\n<p>“I should like to live here all</p>\n<p>my life.</p>\n<p>See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich</p>\n<p>and green the moss is that clings to these old trees.</p>\n<p>Surely no wild</p>\n<p>beast could wish a pleasanter home.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.</p>\n<p>“I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not see any of them</p>\n<p>about.”</p>\n<p>They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any</p>\n<p>farther.</p>\n<p>Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the</p>\n<p>Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.</p>\n",
        "<p>When morning came, they started again.</p>\n<p>Before they had gone far they</p>\n<p>heard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals.</p>\n<p>Toto</p>\n<p>whimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they</p>\n<p>kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the</p>\n<p>wood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety.</p>\n",
        "<p>There</p>\n<p>were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the</p>\n<p>others in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he</p>\n<p>judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.</p>\n<p>As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the</p>\n",
        "<p>great assemblage hushed as if by magic.</p>\n<p>The biggest of the tigers came</p>\n<p>up to the Lion and bowed, saying:</p>\n<p>“Welcome, O King of Beasts!</p>\n<p>You have come in good time to fight our</p>\n<p>enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.”</p>\n<p>“What is your trouble?” asked the Lion quietly.</p>\n",
        "<p>“We are all threatened,” answered the tiger, “by a fierce enemy which</p>\n<p>has lately come into this forest.</p>\n<p>It is a most tremendous monster, like</p>\n<p>a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a</p>\n<p>tree trunk.</p>\n<p>It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls</p>\n<p>through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his</p>\n",
        "<p>mouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly.</p>\n<p>Not one of us is safe</p>\n<p>while this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to</p>\n<p>decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.”</p>\n<p>The Lion thought for a moment.</p>\n<p>“Are there any other lions in this forest?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all.</p>\n",
        "<p>And, besides,</p>\n<p>they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.”</p>\n<p>“If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as</p>\n<p>King of the Forest?” inquired the Lion.</p>\n<p>“We will do that gladly,” returned the tiger; and all the other beasts</p>\n<p>roared with a mighty roar: “We will!”</p>\n<p>“Where is this great spider of yours now?” asked the Lion.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Yonder, among the oak trees,” said the tiger, pointing with his</p>\n<p>forefoot.</p>\n<p>“Take good care of these friends of mine,” said the Lion, “and I will</p>\n<p>go at once to fight the monster.”</p>\n<p>He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle</p>\n<p>with the enemy.</p>\n<p>The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it</p>\n",
        "<p>looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust.</p>\n<p>Its legs</p>\n<p>were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with</p>\n<p>coarse black hair.</p>\n<p>It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a</p>\n<p>foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as</p>\n<p>slender as a wasp’s waist.</p>\n",
        "<p>This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to</p>\n<p>attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep</p>\n<p>than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the</p>\n<p>monster’s back.</p>\n<p>Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with</p>\n<p>sharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body.</p>\n<p>Jumping down,</p>\n",
        "<p>he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was</p>\n<p>quite dead.</p>\n<p>The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were</p>\n<p>waiting for him and said proudly:</p>\n<p>“You need fear your enemy no longer.”</p>\n<p>Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised</p>\n<p>to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her</p>\n",
        "<p>way to Kansas.</p>\n<p>Chapter XXII</p>\n<p>The Country of the Quadlings</p>\n<p>The four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and</p>\n<p>when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered</p>\n<p>from top to bottom with great pieces of rock.</p>\n<p>“That will be a hard climb,” said the Scarecrow, “but we must get over</p>\n",
        "<p>the hill, nevertheless.”</p>\n<p>So he led the way and the others followed.</p>\n<p>They had nearly reached the</p>\n<p>first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, “Keep back!”</p>\n<p>“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, “This</p>\n<p>hill belongs to us, and we don’t allow anyone to cross it.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“But we must cross it,” said the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to the country</p>\n<p>of the Quadlings.”</p>\n<p>“But you shall not!” replied the voice, and there stepped from behind</p>\n<p>the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.</p>\n<p>He was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the</p>\n<p>top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles.</p>\n",
        "<p>But he had no arms</p>\n<p>at all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a</p>\n<p>creature could prevent them from climbing the hill.</p>\n<p>So he said, “I’m</p>\n<p>sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether</p>\n<p>you like it or not,” and he walked boldly forward.</p>\n<p>As quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck</p>\n",
        "<p>stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the</p>\n<p>hill.</p>\n<p>Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and</p>\n<p>the man laughed harshly as he said, “It isn’t as easy as you think!”</p>\n<p>A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy</p>\n<p>saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind</p>\n",
        "<p>every rock.</p>\n<p>The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow’s</p>\n<p>mishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up</p>\n<p>the hill.</p>\n<p>Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the</p>\n<p>hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.</p>\n<p>Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion</p>\n",
        "<p>came up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, “It is</p>\n<p>useless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>“What can we do, then?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Call the Winged Monkeys,” suggested the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“You have still</p>\n<p>the right to command them once more.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Very well,” she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered</p>\n<p>the magic words.</p>\n<p>The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few</p>\n<p>moments the entire band stood before her.</p>\n<p>“What are your commands?” inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.</p>\n<p>“Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,” answered the</p>\n<p>girl.</p>\n",
        "<p>“It shall be done,” said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys</p>\n<p>caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n<p>As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with</p>\n<p>vexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not</p>\n<p>reach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely</p>\n<p>over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the</p>\n",
        "<p>Quadlings.</p>\n<p>“This is the last time you can summon us,” said the leader to Dorothy;</p>\n<p>“so good-bye and good luck to you.”</p>\n<p>“Good-bye, and thank you very much,” returned the girl; and the Monkeys</p>\n<p>rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.</p>\n<p>The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy.</p>\n<p>There was field</p>\n",
        "<p>upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between,</p>\n<p>and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them.</p>\n<p>The fences</p>\n<p>and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had</p>\n<p>been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the</p>\n<p>country of the Munchkins.</p>\n<p>The Quadlings themselves, who were short and</p>\n",
        "<p>fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which</p>\n<p>showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.</p>\n<p>The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers</p>\n<p>walked up to it and knocked at the door.</p>\n<p>It was opened by the farmer’s</p>\n<p>wife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them</p>\n<p>all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies,</p>\n",
        "<p>and a bowl of milk for Toto.</p>\n<p>“How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?” asked the child.</p>\n<p>“It is not a great way,” answered the farmer’s wife.</p>\n<p>“Take the road to</p>\n<p>the South and you will soon reach it.”</p>\n<p>Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields</p>\n<p>and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very</p>\n",
        "<p>beautiful Castle.</p>\n<p>Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in</p>\n<p>handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy</p>\n<p>approached, one of them said to her:</p>\n<p>“Why have you come to the South Country?”</p>\n<p>“To see the Good Witch who rules here,” she answered.</p>\n<p>“Will you take me</p>\n",
        "<p>to her?”</p>\n<p>“Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.”</p>\n<p>They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle.</p>\n<p>After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others</p>\n<p>were to be admitted at once.</p>\n<p>Chapter XXIII</p>\n<p>Glinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy’s Wish</p>\n",
        "<p>Before they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of</p>\n<p>the Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the</p>\n<p>Lion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself</p>\n<p>into his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his</p>\n<p>joints.</p>\n<p>When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl</p>\n<p>into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was both beautiful and young to their eyes.</p>\n<p>Her hair was a rich red</p>\n<p>in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders.</p>\n<p>Her dress was</p>\n<p>pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the</p>\n<p>little girl.</p>\n<p>“What can I do for you, my child?” she asked.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her</p>\n<p>to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the</p>\n<p>wonderful adventures they had met with.</p>\n<p>“My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt</p>\n<p>Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that</p>\n<p>will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this</p>\n<p>year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving</p>\n<p>little girl.</p>\n<p>“Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you of a way</p>\n<p>to get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, you must give me</p>\n<p>the Golden Cap.”</p>\n<p>“Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to me now, and</p>\n<p>when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“And I think I shall need their service just those three times,”</p>\n<p>answered Glinda, smiling.</p>\n<p>Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow, “What will you do when Dorothy has left us?”</p>\n<p>“I will return to the Emerald City,” he replied, “for Oz has made me</p>\n<p>its ruler and the people like me.</p>\n<p>The only thing that worries me is how</p>\n",
        "<p>to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.”</p>\n<p>“By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry</p>\n<p>you to the gates of the Emerald City,” said Glinda, “for it would be a</p>\n<p>shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.”</p>\n<p>“Am I really wonderful?” asked the Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“You are unusual,” replied Glinda.</p>\n<p>Turning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, “What will become of you when</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy leaves this country?”</p>\n<p>He leaned on his axe and thought a moment.</p>\n<p>Then he said, “The Winkies</p>\n<p>were very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked</p>\n<p>Witch died.</p>\n<p>I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to</p>\n<p>the Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over</p>\n",
        "<p>them forever.”</p>\n<p>“My second command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda “will be that</p>\n<p>they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies.</p>\n<p>Your brain may not be</p>\n<p>so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really</p>\n<p>brighter than he is—when you are well polished—and I am sure you will</p>\n<p>rule the Winkies wisely and well.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, “When Dorothy</p>\n<p>has returned to her own home, what will become of you?”</p>\n<p>“Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,” he answered, “lies a grand old</p>\n<p>forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King.</p>\n<p>If</p>\n<p>I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily</p>\n<p>there.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“My third command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “shall be to</p>\n<p>carry you to your forest.</p>\n<p>Then, having used up the powers of the Golden</p>\n<p>Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band</p>\n<p>may thereafter be free for evermore.”</p>\n<p>The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good</p>\n<p>Witch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:</p>\n",
        "<p>“You are certainly as good as you are beautiful!</p>\n<p>But you have not yet</p>\n<p>told me how to get back to Kansas.”</p>\n<p>“Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,” replied Glinda.</p>\n<p>“If</p>\n<p>you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the</p>\n<p>very first day you came to this country.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!” cried the</p>\n<p>Scarecrow.</p>\n<p>“I might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s</p>\n<p>cornfield.”</p>\n<p>“And I should not have had my lovely heart,” said the Tin Woodman.</p>\n<p>“I</p>\n<p>might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“And I should have lived a coward forever,” declared the Lion, “and no</p>\n<p>beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.”</p>\n<p>“This is all true,” said Dorothy, “and I am glad I was of use to these</p>\n<p>good friends.</p>\n<p>But now that each of them has had what he most desired,</p>\n<p>and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should</p>\n<p>like to go back to Kansas.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderful powers.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to</p>\n<p>any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in</p>\n<p>the wink of an eye.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is to knock the heels together</p>\n<p>three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to</p>\n",
        "<p>go.”</p>\n<p>“If that is so,” said the child joyfully, “I will ask them to carry me</p>\n<p>back to Kansas at once.”</p>\n<p>She threw her arms around the Lion’s neck and kissed him, patting his</p>\n<p>big head tenderly.</p>\n<p>Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in</p>\n<p>a way most dangerous to his joints.</p>\n",
        "<p>But she hugged the soft, stuffed</p>\n<p>body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face,</p>\n<p>and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her</p>\n<p>loving comrades.</p>\n<p>Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little</p>\n<p>girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she</p>\n<p>had shown to her friends and herself.</p>\n",
        "<p>Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last</p>\n<p>good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times,</p>\n<p>saying:</p>\n<p>“Take me home to Aunt Em!”</p>\n<p>Instantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she</p>\n<p>could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.</p>\n<p>The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly</p>\n",
        "<p>that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where</p>\n<p>she was.</p>\n<p>At length, however, she sat up and looked about her.</p>\n<p>“Good gracious!” she cried.</p>\n<p>For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her</p>\n<p>was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried</p>\n<p>away the old one.</p>\n",
        "<p>Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and</p>\n<p>Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn,</p>\n<p>barking furiously.</p>\n<p>Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet.</p>\n<p>For the Silver</p>\n<p>Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost</p>\n<p>forever in the desert.</p>\n",
        "<h3>Chapter XXIV</h3>\n<p>Home Again</p>\n<p>Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she</p>\n<p>looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her.</p>\n<p>“My darling child!” she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and</p>\n<p>covering her face with kisses.</p>\n<p>“Where in the world did you come from?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“From the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy gravely.</p>\n<p>“And here is Toto, too.</p>\n<p>And oh, Aunt Em!</p>\n<p>I’m so glad to be at home again!”</p>\n"
