        "<p>The old gentry,</p>\n<p>representing the two or three armigerous families which came from</p>\n<p>Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay;</p>\n<p>though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that</p>\n<p>only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace.</p>\n<p>Some of</p>\n<p>the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and</p>\n",

        "<p>geologists and physiographers.</p>\n<p>Other traditions tell of foul odors near the hill-crowning circles of</p>\n<p>stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at</p>\n<p>certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines;</p>\n<p>while still others try to explain the Devil's Hop Yard--a bleak,</p>\n<p>blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow.</p>\n<p>Then,</p>\n",
        "<p>too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills</p>\n<p>which grow vocal on warm nights.</p>\n<p>It is vowed that the birds are</p>\n<p>psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they</p>\n<p>time their eery cries in unison with the sufferer's struggling breath.</p>\n<p>If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they</p>\n<p>instantly flutter away chittering in demoniac laughter; but if they</p>\n",

        "<p>Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill</p>\n<p>at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture</p>\n<p>to be seen.</p>\n<p>Industry did not flourish here, and the Nineteenth Century</p>\n<p>factory movement proved short-lived.</p>\n<p>Oldest of all are the great</p>\n<p>rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more</p>\n",
        "<p>generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers.</p>\n<p>Deposits of</p>\n<p>skulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizable</p>\n<p>table-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such</p>\n<p>spots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many</p>\n<p>ethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory,</p>\n<p>persist in believing the remains Caucasian.</p>\n",
        "<p>2</p>\n<p>It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited</p>\n<p>farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile</p>\n<p>and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5</p>\n<p>a.</p>\n<p>m.</p>\n<p>on Sunday, the second of February, 1913.</p>\n",
        "<p>This date was recalled</p>\n<p>because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe</p>\n<p>under another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded,</p>\n<p>and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout</p>\n<p>the night before.</p>\n<p>Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother</p>\n<p>was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive</p>\n",
        "<p>albino woman of 35, living with an aged and half-insane father</p>\n<p>about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered</p>\n<p>in his youth.</p>\n<p>Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according</p>\n<p>to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child;</p>\n<p>concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might--and</p>\n<p>did--speculate as widely as they chose.</p>\n",
        "<p>On the contrary, she seemed</p>\n<p>strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a</p>\n<p>contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to</p>\n<p>mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous</p>\n<p>future.</p>\n<p>Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a</p>\n<p>lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and</p>\n",
        "<p>trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited</p>\n<p>through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to</p>\n<p>pieces with age and worm-holes.</p>\n<p>She had never been to school, but was</p>\n<p>filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had</p>\n<p>taught her.</p>\n<p>The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old</p>\n",
        "<p>Whateley's reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by</p>\n<p>violence of Mrs.</p>\n<p>Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not</p>\n<p>helped to make the place popular.</p>\n<p>Isolated among strange influences,</p>\n<p>Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular</p>\n<p>occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a</p>\n",
        "<p>home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since</p>\n<p>disappeared.</p>\n<p>There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises</p>\n<p>and the dogs' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor</p>\n<p>or midwife presided at his coming.</p>\n<p>Neighbors knew nothing of him till</p>\n<p>a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow</p>\n",
        "<p>into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of</p>\n<p>loungers at Osborn's general store.</p>\n<p>There seemed to be a change in the</p>\n<p>old man--an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which</p>\n<p>subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear--though he</p>\n<p>was not one to be perturbed by any common family event.</p>\n<p>Amidst it all</p>\n",
        "<p>he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and</p>\n<p>what he said of the child's paternity was remembered by many of his</p>\n<p>hearers years afterward.</p>\n<p>\"I dun't keer what folks think--ef Lavinny's boy looked like his pa, he</p>\n<p>wouldn't look like nothin' ye expeck.</p>\n<p>Ye needn't think the only folks</p>\n<p>is the folks hereabouts.</p>\n",

        "<p>Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill!_\"</p>\n<p>The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life</p>\n<p>were old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl</p>\n<p>Sawyer's common-law wife, Mamie Bishop.</p>\n<p>Mamie's visit was frankly one</p>\n<p>of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations;</p>\n<p>but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley</p>\n",
        "<p>had bought of his son Curtis.</p>\n<p>This marked the beginning of a course of</p>\n<p>cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur's family which ended only</p>\n<p>in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did</p>\n<p>the ramshackle Whateley barn seem over-crowded with livestock.</p>\n<p>There</p>\n<p>came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count</p>\n",
        "<p>the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old</p>\n<p>farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anemic,</p>\n<p>bloodless-looking specimens.</p>\n<p>Evidently some blight or distemper,</p>\n<p>perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi</p>\n<p>and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the</p>\n<p>Whateley animals.</p>\n",
        "<p>Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect</p>\n<p>of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice</p>\n<p>during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern</p>\n<p>similar sores about the throats of the gray, unshaven old man and his</p>\n<p>slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.</p>\n<p>In the spring after Wilbur's birth Lavinia resumed her customary</p>\n<p>rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy</p>\n",
        "<p>child.</p>\n<p>Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the</p>\n<p>country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the</p>\n<p>swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit.</p>\n<p>Wilbur's growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his</p>\n<p>birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in</p>\n<p>infants under a full year of age.</p>\n",
        "<p>His motions and even his vocal sounds</p>\n<p>showed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant,</p>\n<p>and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to</p>\n<p>walk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to</p>\n<p>remove.</p>\n<p>It was somewhat after this time--on Hallowe'en--that a great blaze was</p>\n<p>seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like</p>\n",
        "<p>stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones.</p>\n<p>Considerable talk</p>\n<p>was started when Silas Bishop--of the undecayed Bishops--mentioned</p>\n<p>having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother</p>\n<p>about an hour before the blaze was remarked.</p>\n<p>Silas was rounding up a</p>\n<p>stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied</p>\n",
        "<p>the two figures in the dim light of his lantern.</p>\n<p>They darted almost</p>\n<p>noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed</p>\n<p>to think they were entirely unclothed.</p>\n<p>Afterward he could not be sure</p>\n<p>about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair</p>\n<p>of dark blue trunks or trousers on.</p>\n",
        "<p>Wilbur was never subsequently seen</p>\n<p>alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the</p>\n<p>disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to</p>\n<p>fill him with anger and alarm.</p>\n<p>His contrast with his squalid mother and</p>\n<p>grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror</p>\n<p>of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.</p>\n",
        "<p>The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that</p>\n<p>\"Lavinny's black brat\" had commenced to talk, and at the age of only</p>\n<p>eleven months.</p>\n<p>His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its</p>\n<p>difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it</p>\n<p>displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of</p>\n<p>three or four might well be proud.</p>\n",
        "<p>The boy was not talkative, yet when</p>\n<p>he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed</p>\n<p>by Dunwich and its denizens.</p>\n<p>The strangeness did not reside in what he</p>\n<p>said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked</p>\n<p>with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the</p>\n<p>spoken sounds.</p>\n",
        "<p>His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity;</p>\n<p>for though he shared his mother's and grandfather's chinlessness, his</p>\n<p>firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression on his</p>\n<p>large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood</p>\n<p>and well-nigh preternatural intelligence.</p>\n<p>He was, however, exceedingly</p>\n<p>ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost</p>\n",
        "<p>goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish</p>\n<p>skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears.</p>\n<p>He was soon</p>\n<p>disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all</p>\n<p>conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic</p>\n<p>of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the</p>\n<p>dreadful name of _Yog-Sothoth_ in the midst of a circle of stones with</p>\n",
        "<p>a great book open in his arms before him.</p>\n<p>Dogs abhorred the boy, and</p>\n<p>he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their</p>\n<p>barking menace.</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably</p>\n<p>increasing the size of his herd.</p>\n",
        "<p>He also cut timber and began to</p>\n<p>repair the unused parts of his house--a spacious, peaked-roofed affair</p>\n<p>whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose</p>\n<p>three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for</p>\n<p>himself and his daughter.</p>\n<p>There must have been prodigious reserves</p>\n<p>of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard</p>\n",
        "<p>labor; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry</p>\n<p>seemed to show the effects of sound calculation.</p>\n<p>It had really begun</p>\n<p>as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been</p>\n<p>put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock.</p>\n<p>Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no</p>\n<p>less thorough craftsman.</p>\n",
        "<p>His mania showed itself only in his tight</p>\n<p>boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section--though many</p>\n<p>declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at</p>\n<p>all.</p>\n<p>Less inexplicable was his fitting-up of another downstairs room</p>\n<p>for his new grandson--a room which several callers saw, though no one</p>\n<p>was ever admitted to the closely-boarded upper story.</p>\n",
        "<p>This chamber</p>\n<p>he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to</p>\n<p>arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and</p>\n<p>parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously</p>\n<p>in odd corners of the various rooms.</p>\n<p>\"I made some use of 'em,\" he would say as he tried to mend a torn</p>\n<p>black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, \"but</p>\n",
        "<p>the boy's fitten to make better use of 'em.</p>\n<p>He'd orter hev 'em as well</p>\n<p>sot as he kin for they're goin' to be all of his larnin'.\"</p>\n<p>When Wilbur was a year and seven months old--in September of 1914--his</p>\n<p>size and accomplishments were almost alarming.</p>\n<p>He had grown as large as</p>\n<p>a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker.</p>\n",

        "<p>with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many</p>\n<p>others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly</p>\n<p>through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual</p>\n<p>fear.</p>\n<p>As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be</p>\n<p>done about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and</p>\n<p>about the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley.</p>\n",
        "<p>6</p>\n<p>The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928,</p>\n<p>and Dr.</p>\n<p>Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue.</p>\n<p>He had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley's grotesque trip to Cambridge,</p>\n<p>and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the _Necronomicon_</p>\n<p>at the Widener Library.</p>\n",
        "<p>Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage</p>\n<p>had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having</p>\n<p>charge of the dreaded volume.</p>\n<p>Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at</p>\n<p>Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get</p>\n<p>home again, as if he feared the results of being away long.</p>\n<p>Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small</p>\n",
        "<p>hours of the third Dr.</p>\n<p>Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild,</p>\n<p>fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus.</p>\n<p>Deep and</p>\n<p>terrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always</p>\n<p>in mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses.</p>\n<p>Then there</p>\n",
        "<p>rang out a scream from a wholly different throat--such a scream as</p>\n<p>roused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever</p>\n<p>afterward--such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or</p>\n<p>wholly of earth.</p>\n<p>Armitage hastened into some clothing and rushed across the street and</p>\n<p>lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and</p>\n<p>heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library.</p>\n",
        "<p>An open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight.</p>\n<p>What had come</p>\n<p>had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming,</p>\n<p>now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded</p>\n<p>unmistakably from within.</p>\n<p>Some instinct warned Armitage that what was</p>\n<p>taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed</p>\n",
        "<p>back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door.</p>\n<p>Among</p>\n<p>the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr.</p>\n<p>Francis Morgan, men to</p>\n<p>whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two</p>\n<p>he motioned to accompany him inside.</p>\n<p>The inward sounds, except for a</p>\n",
        "<p>watchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided;</p>\n<p>but Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of</p>\n<p>whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical</p>\n<p>piping, as if in unison with the last breath of a dying man.</p>\n<p>The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr.</p>\n<p>Armitage knew</p>\n<p>too well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small</p>\n",

        "<p>Professor Rice declares that he wholly</p>\n<p>lost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.</p>\n<p>The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a fetid pool of</p>\n<p>greenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall,</p>\n<p>and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>was not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its</p>\n",
        "<p>chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant</p>\n<p>whippoorwills outside.</p>\n<p>Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel</p>\n<p>were scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty</p>\n<p>canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown.</p>\n<p>Near the central</p>\n<p>desk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later</p>\n",
        "<p>explaining why it had not been fired.</p>\n<p>The thing itself, however,</p>\n<p>crowded out all other images at the time.</p>\n<p>It would be trite and not</p>\n<p>wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may</p>\n<p>properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose</p>\n<p>ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common</p>\n",
        "<p>life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions.</p>\n<p>It was</p>\n<p>partly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands and head, and the</p>\n<p>goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it.</p>\n<p>But the</p>\n<p>torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so</p>\n<p>that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth</p>\n",

        "<p>Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here</p>\n<p>all human resemblance left off and sheer fantasy began.</p>\n<p>The skin was</p>\n<p>thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of</p>\n<p>long greenish-gray tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply.</p>\n<p>Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some</p>\n<p>cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system.</p>\n",
        "<p>On each of the</p>\n<p>hips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to</p>\n<p>be a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of</p>\n<p>trunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences</p>\n<p>of being an undeveloped mouth or throat.</p>\n<p>The limbs, save for their</p>\n<p>black fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth's giant</p>\n",

        "<p>as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly grayish-white</p>\n<p>in the spaces between the purple rings.</p>\n<p>Of genuine blood there was</p>\n<p>none; only the fetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the</p>\n<p>painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious</p>\n<p>discoloration behind it.</p>\n<p>As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it</p>\n",

        "<p>lugubrious howl.</p>\n<p>A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the</p>\n<p>prostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell in appallingly.</p>\n<p>Outside</p>\n<p>the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and</p>\n<p>above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a</p>\n<p>panic-struck whirring and fluttering.</p>\n",
        "<p>Against the moon vast clouds of</p>\n<p>feathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they</p>\n<p>had sought for prey.</p>\n<p>All at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and</p>\n<p>leaped nervously out the window by which it had entered.</p>\n<p>A cry rose</p>\n<p>from the crowd, and Dr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Armitage shouted to the men outside that no</p>\n<p>one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came.</p>\n<p>He was</p>\n<p>thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering</p>\n<p>in, and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one.</p>\n<p>By this</p>\n<p>time two policemen had arrived; and Dr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Morgan, meeting them in the</p>\n<p>vestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to</p>\n<p>the stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate</p>\n<p>thing could be covered up.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor.</p>\n<p>One need</p>\n<p>not describe the _kind_ and _rate_ of shrinkage and disintegration that</p>\n",
        "<p>occurred before the eyes of Dr.</p>\n<p>Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is</p>\n<p>permissible to say that, aside from the external appearance of face</p>\n<p>and hands, the really human elements in Wilbur Whateley must have been</p>\n<p>very small.</p>\n<p>When the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky</p>\n<p>whitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous odor had nearly</p>\n",
