        "<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>\n<p>THERE IS NO ONE LEFT</p>\n<p>When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live</p>\n<p>with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking</p>\n<p>child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a</p>\n<p>little thin face and a little thin body, thin light</p>\n<p>hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and</p>\n<p>her face was yellow because she had been born in</p>",
        "<p>India and had always been ill in one way or</p>\n<p>another. Her father had held a position under the English</p>\n<p>Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and</p>\n<p>her mother had been a great beauty who cared only</p>\n<p>to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.</p>\n<p>She had not wanted a little girl at all, and</p>\n<p>when Mary was born she handed her over to the</p>",
        "<p>care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that</p>\n<p>if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must</p>\n<p>keep the child out of sight as much as possible.</p>\n<p>So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby</p>\n<p>she was kept out of the way, and when she</p>\n<p>became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out</p>\n<p>of the way also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything</p>",
        "<p>but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other</p>\n<p>native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave</p>\n<p>her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib</p>\n<p>would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying,</p>\n<p>by the time she was six years old she was</p>\n<p>as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.</p>\n<p>The young English governess who came to teach her to</p>",
        "<p>read and write disliked her so much that she gave</p>\n<p>up her place in three months, and when other governesses</p>\n<p>came to try to fill it they always went away</p>\n<p>in a shorter time than the first one. So if</p>\n<p>Mary had not chosen to really want to know how</p>\n<p>to read books she would never have learned her letters</p>\n<p>at all.</p>",
        "<p>One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years</p>\n<p>old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser</p>\n<p>still when she saw that the servant who stood by</p>\n<p>her bedside was not her Ayah.</p>\n<p>\"Why did you come?\" she said to the strange woman.</p>\n<p>\"I will not let you stay. Send my Ayah to</p>\n<p>me.\"</p>",
        "<p>The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the</p>\n<p>Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into</p>\n<p>a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only</p>\n<p>more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for</p>\n<p>the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.</p>\n<p>There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing</p>\n<p>was done in its regular order and several of the</p>",
        "<p>native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk</p>\n<p>or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no</p>\n<p>one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not</p>\n<p>come. She was actually left alone as the morning went</p>\n<p>on, and at last she wandered out into the garden</p>\n<p>and began to play by herself under a tree near</p>\n<p>the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed,</p>",
        "<p>and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps</p>\n<p>of earth, all the time growing more and more angry</p>\n<p>and muttering to herself the things she would say and</p>\n<p>the names she would call Saidie when she returned.</p>\n<p>\"Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!\" she said, because to call</p>\n<p>a native a pig is the worst insult of all.</p>\n<p>She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and</p>",
        "<p>over again when she heard her mother come out on</p>\n<p>the veranda with some one. She was with a fair</p>\n<p>young man and they stood talking together in low strange</p>\n<p>voices. Mary knew the fair young man who looked like</p>\n<p>a boy. She had heard that he was a very</p>\n<p>young officer who had just come from England. The child</p>\n<p>stared at him, but she stared most at her mother.</p>",
        "<p>She always did this when she had a chance to</p>\n<p>see her, because the Mem Sahib--Mary used to call her</p>\n<p>that oftener than anything else--was such a tall, slim, pretty</p>\n<p>person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like</p>\n<p>curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which</p>\n<p>seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing</p>\n<p>eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary</p>",
        "<p>said they were \"full of lace.\" They looked fuller of</p>\n<p>lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not</p>\n<p>laughing at all. They were large and scared and lifted</p>\n<p>imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.</p>\n<p>\"Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?\" Mary heard</p>\n<p>her say.</p>\n<p>\"Awfully,\" the young man answered in a trembling voice. \"Awfully,</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills</p>\n<p>two weeks ago.\"</p>\n<p>The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I know I ought!\" she cried. \"I only stayed</p>\n<p>to go to that silly dinner party. What a fool</p>\n<p>I was!\"</p>\n<p>At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing</p>",
        "<p>broke out from the servants' quarters that she clutched the</p>\n<p>young man's arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to</p>\n<p>foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.</p>\n<p>\"What is it? What is it?\" Mrs. Lennox gasped.</p>\n<p>\"Some one has died,\" answered the boy officer. \"You did</p>\n<p>not say it had broken out among your servants.\"</p>\n<p>\"I did not know!\" the Mem Sahib cried. \"Come with</p>",
        "<p>me! Come with me!\" and she turned and ran into</p>\n<p>the house.</p>\n<p>After that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the</p>\n<p>morning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out</p>\n<p>in its most fatal form and people were dying like</p>\n<p>flies. The Ayah had been taken ill in the night,</p>\n<p>and it was because she had just died that the</p>",
        "<p>servants had wailed in the huts. Before the next day</p>\n<p>three other servants were dead and others had run away</p>\n<p>in terror. There was panic on every side, and dying</p>\n<p>people in all the bungalows.</p>\n<p>During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary</p>\n<p>hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by every</p>\n<p>one. Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange</p>",
        "<p>things happened of which she knew nothing. Mary alternately cried</p>\n<p>and slept through the hours. She only knew that people</p>\n<p>were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds.</p>\n<p>Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty,</p>\n<p>though a partly finished meal was on the table and</p>\n<p>chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily</p>\n<p>pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason.</p>",
        "<p>The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty</p>\n<p>she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled.</p>\n<p>It was sweet, and she did not know how strong</p>\n<p>it was. Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and</p>\n<p>she went back to her nursery and shut herself in</p>\n<p>again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and</p>\n<p>by the hurrying sound of feet. The wine made her</p>",
        "<p>so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open</p>\n<p>and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing</p>\n<p>more for a long time.</p>\n<p>Many things happened during the hours in which she slept</p>\n<p>so heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails</p>\n<p>and the sound of things being carried in and out</p>\n<p>of the bungalow.</p>",
        "<p>When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall.</p>\n<p>The house was perfectly still. She had never known it</p>\n<p>to be so silent before. She heard neither voices nor</p>\n<p>footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the</p>\n<p>cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also</p>\n<p>who would take care of her now her Ayah was</p>\n<p>dead. There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she</p>",
        "<p>would know some new stories. Mary had been rather tired</p>\n<p>of the old ones. She did not cry because her</p>\n<p>nurse had died. She was not an affectionate child and</p>\n<p>had never cared much for any one. The noise and</p>\n<p>hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her,</p>\n<p>and she had been angry because no one seemed to</p>\n<p>remember that she was alive. Every one was too panic-stricken</p>",
        "<p>to think of a little girl no one was fond</p>\n<p>of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they</p>\n<p>remembered nothing but themselves. But if every one had got</p>\n<p>well again, surely some one would remember and come to</p>\n<p>look for her.</p>\n<p>But no one came, and as she lay waiting the</p>\n<p>house seemed to grow more and more silent. She heard</p>",
        "<p>something rustling on the matting and when she looked down</p>\n<p>she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her</p>\n<p>with eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he</p>\n<p>was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her</p>\n<p>and he seemed in a hurry to get out of</p>\n<p>the room. He slipped under the door as she watched</p>\n<p>him.</p>",
        "<p>\"How queer and quiet it is,\" she said. \"It sounds</p>\n<p>as if there was no one in the bungalow but</p>\n<p>me and the snake.\"</p>\n<p>Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound,</p>\n<p>and then on the veranda. They were men's footsteps, and</p>\n<p>the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices.</p>\n<p>No one went to meet or speak to them and</p>",
        "<p>they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.</p>\n<p>\"What desolation!\" she heard one voice say. \"That pretty, pretty</p>\n<p>woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was</p>\n<p>a child, though no one ever saw her.\"</p>\n<p>Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when</p>\n<p>they opened the door a few minutes later. She looked</p>\n<p>an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she</p>",
        "<p>was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected. The</p>\n<p>first man who came in was a large officer she</p>\n<p>had once seen talking to her father. He looked tired</p>\n<p>and troubled, but when he saw her he was so</p>\n<p>startled that he almost jumped back.</p>\n<p>\"Barney!\" he cried out. \"There is a child here! A</p>\n<p>child alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us,</p>",
        "<p>who is she!\"</p>\n<p>\"I am Mary Lennox,\" the little girl said, drawing herself</p>\n<p>up stiffly. She thought the man was very rude to</p>\n<p>call her father's bungalow \"A place like this!\" \"I fell</p>\n<p>asleep when every one had the cholera and I have</p>\n<p>only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?\"</p>\n<p>\"It is the child no one ever saw!\" exclaimed the</p>",
        "<p>man, turning to his companions. \"She has actually been forgotten!\"</p>\n<p>\"Why was I forgotten?\" Mary said, stamping her foot. \"Why</p>\n<p>does nobody come?\"</p>\n<p>The young man whose name was Barney looked at her</p>\n<p>very sadly. Mary even thought she saw him wink his</p>\n<p>eyes as if to wink tears away.</p>\n<p>\"Poor little kid!\" he said. \"There is nobody left to</p>",
        "<p>come.\"</p>\n<p>It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary</p>\n<p>found out that she had neither father nor mother left;</p>\n<p>that they had died and been carried away in the</p>\n<p>night, and that the few native servants who had not</p>\n<p>died also had left the house as quickly as they</p>\n<p>could get out of it, none of them even remembering</p>",
        "<p>that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the</p>\n<p>place was so quiet. It was true that there was</p>\n<p>no one in the bungalow but herself and the little</p>\n<p>rustling snake.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>\n<p>MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY</p>\n<p>Mary had liked to look at her mother from a</p>\n<p>distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as</p>\n<p>she knew very little of her she could scarcely have</p>\n<p>been expected to love her or to miss her very</p>\n<p>much when she was gone. She did not miss her</p>\n<p>at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed</p>",
        "<p>child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she</p>\n<p>had always done. If she had been older she would</p>\n<p>no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone</p>\n<p>in the world, but she was very young, and as</p>\n<p>she had always been taken care of, she supposed she</p>\n<p>always would be. What she thought was that she would</p>\n<p>like to know if she was going to nice people,</p>",
        "<p>who would be polite to her and give her her</p>\n<p>own way as her Ayah and the other native servants</p>\n<p>had done.</p>\n<p>She knew that she was not going to stay at</p>\n<p>the English clergyman's house where she was taken at first.</p>\n<p>She did not want to stay. The English clergyman was</p>\n<p>poor and he had five children nearly all the same</p>",
        "<p>age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling</p>\n<p>and snatching toys from each other. Mary hated their untidy</p>\n<p>bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the</p>\n<p>first day or two nobody would play with her. By</p>\n<p>the second day they had given her a nickname which</p>\n<p>made her furious.</p>\n<p>It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was</p>",
        "<p>a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up</p>\n<p>nose and Mary hated him. She was playing by herself</p>\n<p>under a tree, just as she had been playing the</p>\n<p>day the cholera broke out. She was making heaps of</p>\n<p>earth and paths for a garden and Basil came and</p>\n<p>stood near to watch her. Presently he got rather interested</p>\n<p>and suddenly made a suggestion.</p>",
        "<p>\"Why don't you put a heap of stones there and</p>\n<p>pretend it is a rockery?\" he said. \"There in the</p>\n<p>middle,\" and he leaned over her to point.</p>\n<p>\"Go away!\" cried Mary. \"I don't want boys. Go away!\"</p>\n<p>For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began</p>\n<p>to tease. He was always teasing his sisters. He danced</p>\n<p>round and round her and made faces and sang and</p>",
        "<p>laughed.</p>\n<p>\"Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow? With</p>\n<p>silver bells, and cockle shells, And marigolds all in a</p>\n<p>row.\"</p>\n<p>He sang it until the other children heard and laughed,</p>\n<p>too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang</p>\n<p>\"Mistress Mary, quite contrary\"; and after that as long as</p>",
        "<p>she stayed with them they called her \"Mistress Mary Quite</p>\n<p>Contrary\" when they spoke of her to each other, and</p>\n<p>often when they spoke to her.</p>\n<p>\"You are going to be sent home,\" Basil said to</p>\n<p>her, \"at the end of the week. And we're glad</p>\n<p>of it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am glad of it, too,\" answered Mary. \"Where is</p>",
        "<p>home?\"</p>\n<p>\"She doesn't know where home is!\" said Basil, with seven-year-old</p>\n<p>scorn. \"It's England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and</p>\n<p>our sister Mabel was sent to her last year. You</p>\n<p>are not going to your grandmama. You have none. You</p>\n<p>are going to your uncle. His name is Mr. Archibald</p>\n<p>Craven.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I don't know anything about him,\" snapped Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I know you don't,\" Basil answered. \"You don't know anything.</p>\n<p>Girls never do. I heard father and mother talking about</p>\n<p>him. He lives in a great, big, desolate old house</p>\n<p>in the country and no one goes near him. He's</p>\n<p>so cross he won't let them, and they wouldn't come</p>\n<p>if he would let them. He's a hunchback, and he's</p>",
        "<p>horrid.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't believe you,\" said Mary; and she turned her</p>\n<p>back and stuck her fingers in her ears, because she</p>\n<p>would not listen any more.</p>\n<p>But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and</p>\n<p>when Mrs. Crawford told her that night that she was</p>\n<p>going to sail away to England in a few days</p>",
        "<p>and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived</p>\n<p>at Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested</p>\n<p>that they did not know what to think about her.</p>\n<p>They tried to be kind to her, but she only</p>\n<p>turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss</p>\n<p>her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her</p>\n<p>shoulder.</p>",
        "<p>\"She is such a plain child,\" Mrs. Crawford said pityingly,</p>\n<p>afterward. \"And her mother was such a pretty creature. She</p>\n<p>had a very pretty manner, too, and Mary has the</p>\n<p>most unattractive ways I ever saw in a child. The</p>\n<p>children call her 'Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,' and though it's</p>\n<p>naughty of them, one can't help understanding it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and</p>",
        "<p>her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have</p>\n<p>learned some pretty ways too. It is very sad, now</p>\n<p>the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that many</p>\n<p>people never even knew that she had a child at</p>\n<p>all.\"</p>\n<p>\"I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,\" sighed Mrs.</p>\n<p>Crawford. \"When her Ayah was dead there was no one</p>",
        "<p>to give a thought to the little thing. Think of</p>\n<p>the servants running away and leaving her all alone in</p>\n<p>that deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out</p>\n<p>of his skin when he opened the door and found</p>\n<p>her standing by herself in the middle of the room.\"</p>\n<p>Mary made the long voyage to England under the care</p>\n<p>of an officer's wife, who was taking her children to</p>",
        "<p>leave them in a boarding-school. She was very much absorbed</p>\n<p>in her own little boy and girl, and was rather</p>\n<p>glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr.</p>\n<p>Archibald Craven sent to meet her, in London. The woman</p>\n<p>was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock. She was a stout woman, with very red</p>\n<p>cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very purple</p>",
        "<p>dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it</p>\n<p>and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck</p>\n<p>up and trembled when she moved her head. Mary did</p>\n<p>not like her at all, but as she very seldom</p>\n<p>liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which</p>\n<p>it was very evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much</p>\n<p>of her.</p>",
        "<p>\"My word! she's a plain little piece of goods!\" she</p>\n<p>said. \"And we'd heard that her mother was a beauty.</p>\n<p>She hasn't handed much of it down, has she, ma'am?\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,\" the officer's</p>\n<p>wife said good-naturedly. \"If she were not so sallow and</p>\n<p>had a nicer expression, her features are rather good. Children</p>\n<p>alter so much.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"She'll have to alter a good deal,\" answered Mrs. Medlock.</p>\n<p>\"And there's nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite--if you</p>\n<p>ask me!\"</p>\n<p>They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing</p>\n<p>a little apart from them at the window of the</p>\n<p>private hotel they had gone to. She was watching the</p>\n<p>passing buses and cabs, and people, but she heard quite</p>",
        "<p>well and was made very curious about her uncle and</p>\n<p>the place he lived in. What sort of a place</p>\n<p>was it, and what would he be like? What was</p>\n<p>a hunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were</p>\n<p>none in India.</p>\n<p>Since she had been living in other people's houses and</p>\n<p>had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely</p>",
        "<p>and to think queer thoughts which were new to her.</p>\n<p>She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed</p>\n<p>to belong to any one even when her father and</p>\n<p>mother had been alive. Other children seemed to belong to</p>\n<p>their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to</p>\n<p>really be any one's little girl. She had had servants,</p>\n<p>and food and clothes, but no one had taken any</p>",
        "<p>notice of her. She did not know that this was</p>\n<p>because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course,</p>\n<p>she did not know she was disagreeable. She often thought</p>\n<p>that other people were, but she did not know that</p>\n<p>she was so herself.</p>\n<p>She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had</p>\n<p>ever seen, with her common, highly colored face and her</p>",
        "<p>common fine bonnet. When the next day they set out</p>\n<p>on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through the station</p>\n<p>to the railway carriage with her head up and trying</p>\n<p>to keep as far away from her as she could,</p>\n<p>because she did not want to seem to belong to</p>\n<p>her. It would have made her very angry to think</p>\n<p>people imagined she was her little girl.</p>",
        "<p>But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by</p>\n<p>her and her thoughts. She was the kind of woman</p>\n<p>who would \"stand no nonsense from young ones.\" At least,</p>\n<p>that is what she would have said if she had</p>\n<p>been asked. She had not wanted to go to London</p>\n<p>just when her sister Maria's daughter was going to be</p>\n<p>married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place as</p>",
        "<p>housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which</p>\n<p>she could keep it was to do at once what</p>\n<p>Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do. She never dared</p>\n<p>even to ask a question.</p>\n<p>\"Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,\" Mr.</p>\n<p>Craven had said in his short, cold way. \"Captain Lennox</p>\n<p>was my wife's brother and I am their daughter's guardian.</p>",
        "<p>The child is to be brought here. You must go</p>\n<p>to London and bring her yourself.\"</p>\n<p>So she packed her small trunk and made the journey.</p>\n<p>Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and</p>\n<p>looked plain and fretful. She had nothing to read or</p>\n<p>to look at, and she had folded her thin little</p>\n<p>black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her</p>",
        "<p>look yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled</p>\n<p>from under her black crêpe hat.</p>\n<p>\"A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my</p>\n<p>life,\" Mrs. Medlock thought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and</p>\n<p>means spoiled and pettish.) She had never seen a child</p>\n<p>who sat so still without doing anything; and at last</p>\n<p>she got tired of watching her and began to talk</p>",
        "<p>in a brisk, hard voice.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose I may as well tell you something about</p>\n<p>where you are going to,\" she said. \"Do you know</p>\n<p>anything about your uncle?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Never heard your father and mother talk about him?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" said Mary frowning. She frowned because she remembered that</p>",
        "<p>her father and mother had never talked to her about</p>\n<p>anything in particular. Certainly they had never told her things.</p>\n<p>\"Humph,\" muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsive little</p>\n<p>face. She did not say any more for a few</p>\n<p>moments and then she began again.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose you might as well be told something--to prepare</p>\n<p>you. You are going to a queer place.\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather</p>\n<p>discomfited by her apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath,</p>\n<p>she went on.</p>\n<p>\"Not but that it's a grand big place in a</p>\n<p>gloomy way, and Mr. Craven's proud of it in his</p>\n<p>way--and that's gloomy enough, too. The house is six hundred</p>\n<p>years old and it's on the edge of the moor,</p>",
        "<p>and there's near a hundred rooms in it, though most</p>\n<p>of them's shut up and locked. And there's pictures and</p>\n<p>fine old furniture and things that's been there for ages,</p>\n<p>and there's a big park round it and gardens and</p>\n<p>trees with branches trailing to the ground--some of them.\" She</p>\n<p>paused and took another breath. \"But there's nothing else,\" she</p>\n<p>ended suddenly.</p>",
        "<p>Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself. It</p>\n<p>all sounded so unlike India, and anything new rather attracted</p>\n<p>her. But she did not intend to look as if</p>\n<p>she were interested. That was one of her unhappy, disagreeable</p>\n<p>ways. So she sat still.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said Mrs. Medlock. \"What do you think of it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing,\" she answered. \"I know nothing about such places.\"</p>",
        "<p>That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" she said, \"but you are like an old woman.</p>\n<p>Don't you care?\"</p>\n<p>\"It doesn't matter,\" said Mary, \"whether I care or not.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are right enough there,\" said Mrs. Medlock. \"It doesn't.</p>\n<p>What you're to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I</p>\n<p>don't know, unless because it's the easiest way. _He's_ not</p>",
        "<p>going to trouble himself about you, that's sure and certain.</p>\n<p>He never troubles himself about no one.\"</p>\n<p>She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something</p>\n<p>in time.</p>\n<p>\"He's got a crooked back,\" she said. \"That set him</p>\n<p>wrong. He was a sour young man and got no</p>\n<p>good of all his money and big place till he</p>",
        "<p>was married.\"</p>\n<p>Mary's eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention</p>\n<p>not to seem to care. She had never thought of</p>\n<p>the hunchback's being married and she was a trifle surprised.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkative</p>\n<p>woman she continued with more interest. This was one way</p>\n<p>of passing some of the time, at any rate.</p>",
        "<p>\"She was a sweet, pretty thing and he'd have walked</p>\n<p>the world over to get her a blade o' grass</p>\n<p>she wanted. Nobody thought she'd marry him, but she did,</p>\n<p>and people said she married him for his money. But</p>\n<p>she didn't--she didn't,\" positively. \"When she died--\"</p>\n<p>Mary gave a little involuntary jump.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! did she die!\" she exclaimed, quite without meaning to.</p>",
        "<p>She had just remembered a French fairy story she had</p>\n<p>once read called \"Riquet à la Houppe.\" It had been</p>\n<p>about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it</p>\n<p>had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, she died,\" Mrs. Medlock answered. \"And it made him</p>\n<p>queerer than ever. He cares about nobody. He won't see</p>\n<p>people. Most of the time he goes away, and when</p>",
        "<p>he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the</p>\n<p>West Wing and won't let any one but Pitcher see</p>\n<p>him. Pitcher's an old fellow, but he took care of</p>\n<p>him when he was a child and he knows his</p>\n<p>ways.\"</p>\n<p>It sounded like something in a book and it did</p>\n<p>not make Mary feel cheerful. A house with a hundred</p>",
        "<p>rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors locked--a</p>\n<p>house on the edge of a moor--whatsoever a moor was--sounded</p>\n<p>dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself</p>\n<p>up also! She stared out of the window with her</p>\n<p>lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the</p>\n<p>rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting</p>\n<p>lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If the</p>",
        "<p>pretty wife had been alive she might have made things</p>\n<p>cheerful by being something like her own mother and by</p>\n<p>running in and out and going to parties as she</p>\n<p>had done in frocks \"full of lace.\" But she was</p>\n<p>not there any more.</p>\n<p>\"You needn't expect to see him, because ten to one</p>\n<p>you won't,\" said Mrs. Medlock. \"And you mustn't expect that</p>",
        "<p>there will be people to talk to you. You'll have</p>\n<p>to play about and look after yourself. You'll be told</p>\n<p>what rooms you can go into and what rooms you're</p>\n<p>to keep out of. There's gardens enough. But when you're</p>\n<p>in the house don't go wandering and poking about. Mr.</p>\n<p>Craven won't have it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I shall not want to go poking about,\" said sour</p>",
        "<p>little Mary; and just as suddenly as she had begun</p>\n<p>to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she began</p>\n<p>to cease to be sorry and to think he was</p>\n<p>unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him.</p>\n<p>And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of</p>\n<p>the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at</p>\n<p>the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go</p>",
        "<p>on forever and ever. She watched it so long and</p>\n<p>steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her</p>\n<p>eyes and she fell asleep.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>\n<p>ACROSS THE MOOR</p>\n<p>She slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs.</p>\n<p>Medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations</p>\n<p>and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread</p>\n<p>and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to</p>\n<p>be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in</p>\n<p>the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted</p>",
        "<p>the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up</p>\n<p>very much over her tea and chicken and beef. She</p>\n<p>ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and</p>\n<p>Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine</p>\n<p>bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep</p>\n<p>once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled by</p>\n<p>the splashing of the rain against the windows. It was</p>",
        "<p>quite dark when she awakened again. The train had stopped</p>\n<p>at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.</p>\n<p>\"You have had a sleep!\" she said. \"It's time to</p>\n<p>open your eyes! We're at Thwaite Station and we've got</p>\n<p>a long drive before us.\"</p>\n<p>Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open</p>\n<p>while Mrs. Medlock collected her parcels. The little girl did</p>",
        "<p>not offer to help her, because in India native servants</p>\n<p>always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite</p>\n<p>proper that other people should wait on one.</p>\n<p>The station was a small one and nobody but themselves</p>\n<p>seemed to be getting out of the train. The station-master</p>\n<p>spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing</p>\n<p>his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found</p>",
        "<p>out afterward was Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>\"I see tha's got back,\" he said. \"An' tha's browt</p>\n<p>th' young 'un with thee.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that's her,\" answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire</p>\n<p>accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward</p>\n<p>Mary. \"How's thy Missus?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well enow. Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee.\"</p>",
        "<p>A brougham stood on the road before the little outside</p>\n<p>platform. Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and</p>\n<p>that it was a smart footman who helped her in.</p>\n<p>His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his</p>\n<p>hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was,</p>\n<p>the burly station-master included.</p>\n<p>When he shut the door, mounted the box with the</p>",
        "<p>coachman, and they drove off, the little girl found herself</p>\n<p>seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she was not</p>\n<p>inclined to go to sleep again. She sat and looked</p>\n<p>out of the window, curious to see something of the</p>\n<p>road over which she was being driven to the queer</p>\n<p>place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of. She was not at</p>\n<p>all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened,</p>",
        "<p>but she felt that there was no knowing what might</p>\n<p>happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all</p>\n<p>shut up--a house standing on the edge of a moor.</p>\n<p>\"What is a moor?\" she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.</p>\n<p>\"Look out of the window in about ten minutes and</p>\n<p>you'll see,\" the woman answered. \"We've got to drive five</p>\n<p>miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor.</p>",
        "<p>You won't see much because it's a dark night, but</p>\n<p>you can see something.\"</p>\n<p>Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness</p>\n<p>of her corner, keeping her eyes on the window. The</p>\n<p>carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead</p>\n<p>of them and she caught glimpses of the things they</p>\n<p>passed. After they had left the station they had driven</p>",
        "<p>through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages</p>\n<p>and the lights of a public house. Then they had</p>\n<p>passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window</p>\n<p>or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and</p>\n<p>odd things set out for sale. Then they were on</p>\n<p>the highroad and she saw hedges and trees. After that</p>\n<p>there seemed nothing different for a long time--or at least</p>",
        "<p>it seemed a long time to her.</p>\n<p>At last the horses began to go more slowly, as</p>\n<p>if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to</p>\n<p>be no more hedges and no more trees. She could</p>\n<p>see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either</p>\n<p>side. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the</p>\n<p>window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.</p>",
        "<p>\"Eh! We're on the moor now sure enough,\" said Mrs.</p>\n<p>Medlock.</p>\n<p>The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking</p>\n<p>road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low</p>\n<p>growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark</p>\n<p>apparently spread out before and around them. A wind was</p>\n<p>rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.</p>",
        "<p>\"It's--it's not the sea, is it?\" said Mary, looking round</p>\n<p>at her companion.</p>\n<p>\"No, not it,\" answered Mrs. Medlock. \"Nor it isn't fields</p>\n<p>nor mountains, it's just miles and miles and miles of</p>\n<p>wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse</p>\n<p>and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and</p>\n<p>sheep.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I feel as if it might be the sea, if</p>\n<p>there were water on it,\" said Mary. \"It sounds like</p>\n<p>the sea just now.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's the wind blowing through the bushes,\" Mrs. Medlock said.</p>\n<p>\"It's a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though</p>\n<p>there's plenty that likes it--particularly when the heather's in bloom.\"</p>\n<p>On and on they drove through the darkness, and though</p>",
        "<p>the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and</p>\n<p>made strange sounds. The road went up and down, and</p>\n<p>several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath</p>\n<p>which water rushed very fast with a great deal of</p>\n<p>noise. Mary felt as if the drive would never come</p>\n<p>to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was</p>\n<p>a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was</p>",
        "<p>passing on a strip of dry land.</p>\n<p>\"I don't like it,\" she said to herself. \"I don't</p>\n<p>like it,\" and she pinched her thin lips more tightly</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n<p>The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road</p>\n<p>when she first caught sight of a light. Mrs. Medlock</p>\n<p>saw it as soon as she did and drew a</p>",
        "<p>long sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>\"Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' light</p>\n<p>twinkling,\" she exclaimed. \"It's the light in the lodge window.</p>\n<p>We shall get a good cup of tea after a</p>\n<p>bit, at all events.\"</p>\n<p>It was \"after a bit,\" as she said, for when</p>\n<p>the carriage passed through the park gates there was still</p>",
        "<p>two miles of avenue to drive through and the trees</p>\n<p>(which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they</p>\n<p>were driving through a long dark vault.</p>\n<p>They drove out of the vault into a clear space</p>\n<p>and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which</p>\n<p>seemed to ramble round a stone court. At first Mary</p>\n<p>thought that there were no lights at all in the</p>",
        "<p>windows, but as she got out of the carriage she</p>\n<p>saw that one room in a corner up-stairs showed a</p>\n<p>dull glow.</p>\n<p>The entrance door was a huge one made of massive,</p>\n<p>curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails</p>\n<p>and bound with great iron bars. It opened into an</p>\n<p>enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces</p>",
        "<p>in the portraits on the walls and the figures in</p>\n<p>the suits of armor made Mary feel that she did</p>\n<p>not want to look at them. As she stood on</p>\n<p>the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little</p>\n<p>black figure, and she felt as small and lost and</p>\n<p>odd as she looked.</p>\n<p>A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who</p>",
        "<p>opened the door for them.</p>\n<p>\"You are to take her to her room,\" he said</p>\n<p>in a husky voice. \"He doesn't want to see her.</p>\n<p>He's going to London in the morning.\"</p>\n<p>\"Very well, Mr. Pitcher,\" Mrs. Medlock answered. \"So long as</p>\n<p>I know what's expected of me, I can manage.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,\" Mr. Pitcher said, \"is</p>",
        "<p>that you make sure that he's not disturbed and that</p>\n<p>he doesn't see what he doesn't want to see.\"</p>\n<p>And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase</p>\n<p>and down a long corridor and up a short flight</p>\n<p>of steps and through another corridor and another, until a</p>\n<p>door opened in a wall and she found herself in</p>\n<p>a room with a fire in it and a supper</p>",
        "<p>on a table.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:</p>\n<p>\"Well, here you are! This room and the next are</p>\n<p>where you'll live--and you must keep to them. Don't you</p>\n<p>forget that!\"</p>\n<p>It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite</p>\n<p>Manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary</p>",
        "<p>in all her life.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>\n<p>MARTHA</p>\n<p>When she opened her eyes in the morning it was</p>\n<p>because a young housemaid had come into her room to</p>\n<p>light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking</p>\n<p>out the cinders noisily. Mary lay and watched her for</p>\n<p>a few moments and then began to look about the</p>\n<p>room. She had never seen a room at all like</p>",
        "<p>it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were</p>\n<p>covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it.</p>\n<p>There were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in</p>\n<p>the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of</p>\n<p>a castle. There were hunters and horses and dogs and</p>\n<p>ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest</p>\n<p>with them. Out of a deep window she could see</p>",
        "<p>a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have</p>\n<p>no trees on it, and to look rather like an</p>\n<p>endless, dull, purplish sea.</p>\n<p>\"What is that?\" she said, pointing out of the window.</p>\n<p>Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her</p>\n<p>feet, looked and pointed also.</p>\n<p>\"That there?\" she said.</p>",
        "<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's th' moor,\" with a good-natured grin. \"Does tha' like</p>\n<p>it?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" answered Mary. \"I hate it.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's because tha'rt not used to it,\" Martha said, going</p>\n<p>back to her hearth. \"Tha' thinks it's too big an'</p>\n<p>bare now. But tha' will like it.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Do you?\" inquired Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that I do,\" answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at</p>\n<p>the grate. \"I just love it. It's none bare. It's</p>\n<p>covered wi' growin' things as smells sweet. It's fair lovely</p>\n<p>in spring an' summer when th' gorse an' broom an'</p>\n<p>heather's in flower. It smells o' honey an' there's such</p>\n<p>a lot o' fresh air--an' th' sky looks so high</p>",
        "<p>an' th' bees an' skylarks makes such a nice noise</p>\n<p>hummin' an' singin'. Eh! I wouldn't live away from th'</p>\n<p>moor for anythin'.\"</p>\n<p>Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The</p>\n<p>native servants she had been used to in India were</p>\n<p>not in the least like this. They were obsequious and</p>\n<p>servile and did not presume to talk to their masters</p>",
        "<p>as if they were their equals. They made salaams and</p>\n<p>called them \"protector of the poor\" and names of that</p>\n<p>sort. Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked.</p>\n<p>It was not the custom to say \"please\" and \"thank</p>\n<p>you\" and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the</p>\n<p>face when she was angry. She wondered a little what</p>\n<p>this girl would do if one slapped her in the</p>",
        "<p>face. She was a round, rosy, good-natured looking creature, but</p>\n<p>she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary wonder</p>\n<p>if she might not even slap back--if the person who</p>\n<p>slapped her was only a little girl.</p>\n<p>\"You are a strange servant,\" she said from her pillows,</p>\n<p>rather haughtily.</p>\n<p>Martha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in</p>",
        "<p>her hand, and laughed, without seeming the least out of</p>\n<p>temper.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! I know that,\" she said. \"If there was a</p>\n<p>grand Missus at Misselthwaite I should never have been even</p>\n<p>one of th' under housemaids. I might have been let</p>\n<p>to be scullery-maid but I'd never have been let up-stairs.</p>\n<p>I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire. But</p>",
        "<p>this is a funny house for all it's so grand.</p>\n<p>Seems like there's neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher</p>\n<p>an' Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he won't be troubled about</p>\n<p>anythin' when he's here, an' he's nearly always away. Mrs.</p>\n<p>Medlock gave me th' place out o' kindness. She told</p>\n<p>me she could never have done it if Misselthwaite had</p>\n<p>been like other big houses.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Are you going to be my servant?\" Mary asked, still</p>\n<p>in her imperious little Indian way.</p>\n<p>Martha began to rub her grate again.</p>\n<p>\"I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant,\" she said stoutly. \"An' she's Mr.</p>\n<p>Craven's--but I'm to do the housemaid's work up here an'</p>\n<p>wait on you a bit. But you won't need much</p>\n<p>waitin' on.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Who is going to dress me?\" demanded Mary.</p>\n<p>Martha sat up on her heels again and stared. She</p>\n<p>spoke in broad Yorkshire in her amazement.</p>\n<p>\"Canna' tha' dress thysen!\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean? I don't understand your language,\" said</p>\n<p>Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! I forgot,\" Martha said. \"Mrs. Medlock told me I'd</p>",
        "<p>have to be careful or you wouldn't know what I</p>\n<p>was sayin'. I mean can't you put on your own</p>\n<p>clothes?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" answered Mary, quite indignantly. \"I never did in my</p>\n<p>life. My Ayah dressed me, of course.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that</p>\n<p>she was impudent, \"it's time tha' should learn. Tha' cannot</p>",
        "<p>begin younger. It'll do thee good to wait on thysen</p>\n<p>a bit. My mother always said she couldn't see why</p>\n<p>grand people's children didn't turn out fair fools--what with nurses</p>\n<p>an' bein' washed an' dressed an' took out to walk</p>\n<p>as if they was puppies!\"</p>\n<p>\"It is different in India,\" said Mistress Mary disdainfully. She</p>\n<p>could scarcely stand this.</p>",
        "<p>But Martha was not at all crushed.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! I can see it's different,\" she answered almost sympathetically.</p>\n<p>\"I dare say it's because there's such a lot o'</p>\n<p>blacks there instead o' respectable white people. When I heard</p>\n<p>you was comin' from India I thought you was a</p>\n<p>black too.\"</p>\n<p>Mary sat up in bed furious.</p>",
        "<p>\"What!\" she said. \"What! You thought I was a native.</p>\n<p>You--you daughter of a pig!\"</p>\n<p>Martha stared and looked hot.</p>\n<p>\"Who are you callin' names?\" she said. \"You needn't be</p>\n<p>so vexed. That's not th' way for a young lady</p>\n<p>to talk. I've nothin' against th' blacks. When you read</p>\n<p>about 'em in tracts they're always very religious. You always</p>",
        "<p>read as a black's a man an' a brother. I've</p>\n<p>never seen a black an' I was fair pleased to</p>\n<p>think I was goin' to see one close. When I</p>\n<p>come in to light your fire this mornin' I crep'</p>\n<p>up to your bed an' pulled th' cover back careful</p>\n<p>to look at you. An' there you was,\" disappointedly, \"no</p>\n<p>more black than me--for all you're so yeller.\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary did not even try to control her rage and</p>\n<p>humiliation.</p>\n<p>\"You thought I was a native! You dared! You don't</p>\n<p>know anything about natives! They are not people--they're servants who</p>\n<p>must salaam to you. You know nothing about India. You</p>\n<p>know nothing about anything!\"</p>\n<p>She was in such a rage and felt so helpless</p>",
        "<p>before the girl's simple stare, and somehow she suddenly felt</p>\n<p>so horribly lonely and far away from everything she understood</p>\n<p>and which understood her, that she threw herself face downward</p>\n<p>on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing. She sobbed</p>\n<p>so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a little frightened</p>\n<p>and quite sorry for her. She went to the bed</p>\n<p>and bent over her.</p>",
        "<p>\"Eh! you mustn't cry like that there!\" she begged. \"You</p>\n<p>mustn't for sure. I didn't know you'd be vexed. I</p>\n<p>don't know anythin' about anythin'--just like you said. I beg</p>\n<p>your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin'.\"</p>\n<p>There was something comforting and really friendly in her queer</p>\n<p>Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect</p>\n<p>on Mary. She gradually ceased crying and became quiet. Martha</p>",
        "<p>looked relieved.</p>\n<p>\"It's time for thee to get up now,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Mrs. Medlock said I was to carry tha' breakfast an'</p>\n<p>tea an' dinner into th' room next to this. It's</p>\n<p>been made into a nursery for thee. I'll help thee</p>\n<p>on with thy clothes if tha'll get out o' bed.</p>\n<p>If th' buttons are at th' back tha' cannot button</p>",
        "<p>them up tha'self.\"</p>\n<p>When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes</p>\n<p>Martha took from the wardrobe were not the ones she</p>\n<p>had worn when she arrived the night before with Mrs.</p>\n<p>Medlock.</p>\n<p>\"Those are not mine,\" she said. \"Mine are black.\"</p>\n<p>She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over,</p>",
        "<p>and added with cool approval:</p>\n<p>\"Those are nicer than mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"These are th' ones tha' must put on,\" Martha answered.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get 'em in London.</p>\n<p>He said 'I won't have a child dressed in black</p>\n<p>wanderin' about like a lost soul,' he said. 'It'd make</p>\n<p>the place sadder than it is. Put color on her.'</p>",
        "<p>Mother she said she knew what he meant. Mother always</p>\n<p>knows what a body means. She doesn't hold with black</p>\n<p>hersel'.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hate black things,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>The dressing process was one which taught them both something.</p>\n<p>Martha had \"buttoned up\" her little sisters and brothers but</p>\n<p>she had never seen a child who stood still and</p>",
        "<p>waited for another person to do things for her as</p>\n<p>if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.</p>\n<p>\"Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?\" she said</p>\n<p>when Mary quietly held out her foot.</p>\n<p>\"My Ayah did it,\" answered Mary, staring. \"It was the</p>\n<p>custom.\"</p>\n<p>She said that very often--\"It was the custom.\" The native</p>",
        "<p>servants were always saying it. If one told them to</p>\n<p>do a thing their ancestors had not done for a</p>\n<p>thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, \"It</p>\n<p>is not the custom\" and one knew that was the</p>\n<p>end of the matter.</p>\n<p>It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should</p>\n<p>do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed</p>",
        "<p>like a doll, but before she was ready for breakfast</p>\n<p>she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite Manor</p>\n<p>would end by teaching her a number of things quite</p>\n<p>new to her--things such as putting on her own shoes</p>\n<p>and stockings, and picking up things she let fall. If</p>\n<p>Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady's maid she</p>\n<p>would have been more subservient and respectful and would have</p>",
        "<p>known that it was her business to brush hair, and</p>\n<p>button boots, and pick things up and lay them away.</p>\n<p>She was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic who had</p>\n<p>been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm</p>\n<p>of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of</p>\n<p>doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger</p>\n<p>ones who were either babies in arms or just learning</p>",
        "<p>to totter about and tumble over things.</p>\n<p>If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready</p>\n<p>to be amused she would perhaps have laughed at Martha's</p>\n<p>readiness to talk, but Mary only listened to her coldly</p>\n<p>and wondered at her freedom of manner. At first she</p>\n<p>was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl</p>\n<p>rattled on in her good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to</p>",
        "<p>notice what she was saying.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! you should see 'em all,\" she said. \"There's twelve</p>\n<p>of us an' my father only gets sixteen shilling a</p>\n<p>week. I can tell you my mother's put to it</p>\n<p>to get porridge for 'em all. They tumble about on</p>\n<p>th' moor an' play there all day an' mother says</p>\n<p>th' air of th' moor fattens 'em. She says she</p>",
        "<p>believes they eat th' grass same as th' wild ponies</p>\n<p>do. Our Dickon, he's twelve years old and he's got</p>\n<p>a young pony he calls his own.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where did he get it?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"He found it on th' moor with its mother when</p>\n<p>it was a little one an' he began to make</p>\n<p>friends with it an' give it bits o' bread an'</p>",
        "<p>pluck young grass for it. And it got to like</p>\n<p>him so it follows him about an' it lets him</p>\n<p>get on its back. Dickon's a kind lad an' animals</p>\n<p>likes him.\"</p>\n<p>Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own</p>\n<p>and had always thought she should like one. So she</p>\n<p>began to feel a slight interest in Dickon, and as</p>",
        "<p>she had never before been interested in any one but</p>\n<p>herself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment. When</p>\n<p>she went into the room which had been made into</p>\n<p>a nursery for her, she found that it was rather</p>\n<p>like the one she had slept in. It was not</p>\n<p>a child's room, but a grown-up person's room, with gloomy</p>\n<p>old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs.</p>",
        "<p>A table in the center was set with a good</p>\n<p>substantial breakfast. But she had always had a very small</p>\n<p>appetite, and she looked with something more than indifference at</p>\n<p>the first plate Martha set before her.</p>\n<p>\"I don't want it,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!\" Martha exclaimed incredulously.</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Tha' doesn't know how good it is. Put a bit</p>\n<p>o' treacle on it or a bit o' sugar.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want it,\" repeated Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" said Martha. \"I can't abide to see good victuals</p>\n<p>go to waste. If our children was at this table</p>\n<p>they'd clean it bare in five minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" said Mary coldly.</p>",
        "<p>\"Why!\" echoed Martha. \"Because they scarce ever had their stomachs</p>\n<p>full in their lives. They're as hungry as young hawks</p>\n<p>an' foxes.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what it is to be hungry,\" said</p>\n<p>Mary, with the indifference of ignorance.</p>\n<p>Martha looked indignant.</p>\n<p>\"Well, it would do thee good to try it. I</p>",
        "<p>can see that plain enough,\" she said outspokenly. \"I've no</p>\n<p>patience with folk as sits an' just stares at good</p>\n<p>bread an' meat. My word! don't I wish Dickon and</p>\n<p>Phil an' Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's</p>\n<p>here under their pinafores.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why don't you take it to them?\" suggested Mary.</p>\n<p>\"It's not mine,\" answered Martha stoutly. \"An' this isn't my</p>",
        "<p>day out. I get my day out once a month</p>\n<p>same as th' rest. Then I go home an' clean</p>\n<p>up for mother an' give her a day's rest.\"</p>\n<p>Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and</p>\n<p>some marmalade.</p>\n<p>\"You wrap up warm an' run out an' play you,\"</p>\n<p>said Martha. \"It'll do you good and give you some</p>",
        "<p>stomach for your meat.\"</p>\n<p>Mary went to the window. There were gardens and paths</p>\n<p>and big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry.</p>\n<p>\"Out? Why should I go out on a day like</p>\n<p>this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha'lt have to stay</p>\n<p>in, an' what has tha' got to do?\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary glanced about her. There was nothing to do. When</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock had prepared the nursery she had not thought</p>\n<p>of amusement. Perhaps it would be better to go and</p>\n<p>see what the gardens were like.</p>\n<p>\"Who will go with me?\" she inquired.</p>\n<p>Martha stared.</p>\n<p>\"You'll go by yourself,\" she answered. \"You'll have to learn</p>",
        "<p>to play like other children does when they haven't got</p>\n<p>sisters and brothers. Our Dickon goes off on th' moor</p>\n<p>by himself an' plays for hours. That's how he made</p>\n<p>friends with th' pony. He's got sheep on th' moor</p>\n<p>that knows him, an' birds as comes an' eats out</p>\n<p>of his hand. However little there is to eat, he</p>\n<p>always saves a bit o' his bread to coax his</p>",
        "<p>pets.\"</p>\n<p>It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary</p>\n<p>decide to go out, though she was not aware of</p>\n<p>it. There would be birds outside though there would not</p>\n<p>be ponies or sheep. They would be different from the</p>\n<p>birds in India and it might amuse her to look</p>\n<p>at them.</p>",
        "<p>Martha found her coat and hat for her and a</p>\n<p>pair of stout little boots and she showed her her</p>\n<p>way down-stairs.</p>\n<p>\"If tha' goes round that way tha'll come to th'</p>\n<p>gardens,\" she said, pointing to a gate in a wall</p>\n<p>of shrubbery. \"There's lots o' flowers in summer-time, but there's</p>\n<p>nothin' bloomin' now.\" She seemed to hesitate a second before</p>",
        "<p>she added, \"One of th' gardens is locked up. No</p>\n<p>one has been in it for ten years.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" asked Mary in spite of herself. Here was another</p>\n<p>locked door added to the hundred in the strange house.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so</p>\n<p>sudden. He won't let no one go inside. It was</p>\n<p>her garden. He locked th' door an' dug a hole</p>",
        "<p>and buried th' key. There's Mrs. Medlock's bell ringing--I must</p>\n<p>run.\"</p>\n<p>After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which</p>\n<p>led to the door in the shrubbery. She could not</p>\n<p>help thinking about the garden which no one had been</p>\n<p>into for ten years. She wondered what it would look</p>\n<p>like and whether there were any flowers still alive in</p>",
        "<p>it. When she had passed through the shrubbery gate she</p>\n<p>found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding</p>\n<p>walks with clipped borders. There were trees, and flower-beds, and</p>\n<p>evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with</p>\n<p>an old gray fountain in its midst. But the flower-beds</p>\n<p>were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing.</p>\n<p>This was not the garden which was shut up. How</p>",
        "<p>could a garden be shut up? You could always walk</p>\n<p>into a garden.</p>\n<p>She was just thinking this when she saw that, at</p>\n<p>the end of the path she was following, there seemed</p>\n<p>to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it.</p>\n<p>She was not familiar enough with England to know that</p>\n<p>she was coming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and</p>",
        "<p>fruit were growing. She went toward the wall and found</p>\n<p>that there was a green door in the ivy, and</p>\n<p>that it stood open. This was not the closed garden,</p>\n<p>evidently, and she could go into it.</p>\n<p>She went through the door and found that it was</p>\n<p>a garden with walls all round it and that it</p>\n<p>was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to</p>",
        "<p>open into one another. She saw another open green door,</p>\n<p>revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables. Fruit-trees</p>\n<p>were trained flat against the wall, and over some of</p>\n<p>the beds there were glass frames. The place was bare</p>\n<p>and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared</p>\n<p>about her. It might be nicer in summer when things</p>\n<p>were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.</p>",
        "<p>Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder</p>\n<p>walked through the door leading from the second garden. He</p>\n<p>looked startled when he saw Mary, and then touched his</p>\n<p>cap. He had a surly old face, and did not</p>\n<p>seem at all pleased to see her--but then she was</p>\n<p>displeased with his garden and wore her \"quite contrary\" expression,</p>\n<p>and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see</p>",
        "<p>him.</p>\n<p>\"What is this place?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"One o' th' kitchen-gardens,\" he answered.</p>\n<p>\"What is that?\" said Mary, pointing through the other green</p>\n<p>door.</p>\n<p>\"Another of 'em,\" shortly. \"There's another on t'other side o'</p>\n<p>th' wall an' there's th' orchard t'other side o' that.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Can I go in them?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"If tha' likes. But there's nowt to see.\"</p>\n<p>Mary made no response. She went down the path and</p>\n<p>through the second green door. There she found more walls</p>\n<p>and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second</p>\n<p>wall there was another green door and it was not</p>\n<p>open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one</p>",
        "<p>had seen for ten years. As she was not at</p>\n<p>all a timid child and always did what she wanted</p>\n<p>to do, Mary went to the green door and turned</p>\n<p>the handle. She hoped the door would not open because</p>\n<p>she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious</p>\n<p>garden--but it did open quite easily and she walked through</p>\n<p>it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls</p>",
        "<p>all round it also and trees trained against them, and</p>\n<p>there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass--but there</p>\n<p>was no green door to be seen anywhere. Mary looked</p>\n<p>for it, and yet when she had entered the upper</p>\n<p>end of the garden she had noticed that the wall</p>\n<p>did not seem to end with the orchard but to</p>\n<p>extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at</p>",
        "<p>the other side. She could see the tops of trees</p>\n<p>above the wall, and when she stood still she saw</p>\n<p>a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the</p>\n<p>topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst</p>\n<p>into his winter song--almost as if he had caught sight</p>\n<p>of her and was calling to her.</p>\n<p>She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful,</p>",
        "<p>friendly little whistle gave her a pleased feeling--even a disagreeable</p>\n<p>little girl may be lonely, and the big closed house</p>\n<p>and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made</p>\n<p>this one feel as if there was no one left</p>\n<p>in the world but herself. If she had been an</p>\n<p>affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she</p>\n<p>would have broken her heart, but even though she was</p>",
        "<p>\"Mistress Mary Quite Contrary\" she was desolate, and the bright-breasted</p>\n<p>little bird brought a look into her sour little face</p>\n<p>which was almost a smile. She listened to him until</p>\n<p>he flew away. He was not like an Indian bird</p>\n<p>and she liked him and wondered if she should ever</p>\n<p>see him again. Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden</p>\n<p>and knew all about it.</p>",
        "<p>Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do</p>\n<p>that she thought so much of the deserted garden. She</p>\n<p>was curious about it and wanted to see what it</p>\n<p>was like. Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key?</p>\n<p>If he had liked his wife so much why did</p>\n<p>he hate her garden? She wondered if she should ever</p>\n<p>see him, but she knew that if she did she</p>",
        "<p>should not like him, and he would not like her,</p>\n<p>and that she should only stand and stare at him</p>\n<p>and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully to</p>\n<p>ask him why he had done such a queer thing.</p>\n<p>\"People never like me and I never like people,\" she</p>\n<p>thought. \"And I never can talk as the Crawford children</p>\n<p>could. They were always talking and laughing and making noises.\"</p>",
        "<p>She thought of the robin and of the way he</p>\n<p>seemed to sing his song at her, and as she</p>\n<p>remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rather suddenly</p>\n<p>on the path.</p>\n<p>\"I believe that tree was in the secret garden--I feel</p>\n<p>sure it was,\" she said. \"There was a wall round</p>\n<p>the place and there was no door.\"</p>",
        "<p>She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered</p>\n<p>and found the old man digging there. She went and</p>\n<p>stood beside him and watched him a few moments in</p>\n<p>her cold little way. He took no notice of her</p>\n<p>and so at last she spoke to him.</p>\n<p>\"I have been into the other gardens,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"There was nothin' to prevent thee,\" he answered crustily.</p>",
        "<p>\"I went into the orchard.\"</p>\n<p>\"There was no dog at th' door to bite thee,\"</p>\n<p>he answered.</p>\n<p>\"There was no door there into the other garden,\" said</p>\n<p>Mary.</p>\n<p>\"What garden?\" he said in a rough voice, stopping his</p>\n<p>digging for a moment.</p>",
        "<p>\"The one on the other side of the wall,\" answered</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary. \"There are trees there--I saw the tops of</p>\n<p>them. A bird with a red breast was sitting on</p>\n<p>one of them and he sang.\"</p>\n<p>To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed</p>\n<p>its expression. A slow smile spread over it and the</p>\n<p>gardener looked quite different. It made her think that it</p>",
        "<p>was curious how much nicer a person looked when he</p>\n<p>smiled. She had not thought of it before.</p>\n<p>He turned about to the orchard side of his garden</p>\n<p>and began to whistle--a low soft whistle. She could not</p>\n<p>understand how such a surly man could make such a</p>\n<p>coaxing sound.</p>\n<p>Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. She heard</p>",
        "<p>a soft little rushing flight through the air--and it was</p>\n<p>the bird with the red breast flying to them, and</p>\n<p>he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite</p>\n<p>near to the gardener's foot.</p>\n<p>\"Here he is,\" chuckled the old man, and then he</p>\n<p>spoke to the bird as if he were speaking to</p>\n<p>a child.</p>",
        "<p>\"Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little beggar?\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I've not seen thee before to-day. Has tha' begun tha'</p>\n<p>courtin' this early in th' season? Tha'rt too forrad.\"</p>\n<p>The bird put his tiny head on one side and</p>\n<p>looked up at him with his soft bright eye which</p>\n<p>was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite familiar and</p>\n<p>not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the</p>",
        "<p>earth briskly, looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave</p>\n<p>Mary a queer feeling in her heart, because he was</p>\n<p>so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person.</p>\n<p>He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak,</p>\n<p>and slender delicate legs.</p>\n<p>\"Will he always come when you call him?\" she asked</p>\n<p>almost in a whisper.</p>",
        "<p>\"Aye, that he will. I've knowed him ever since he</p>\n<p>was a fledgling. He come out of th' nest in</p>\n<p>th' other garden an' when first he flew over th'</p>\n<p>wall he was too weak to fly back for a</p>\n<p>few days an' we got friendly. When he went over</p>\n<p>th' wall again th' rest of th' brood was gone</p>\n<p>an' he was lonely an' he come back to me.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"What kind of a bird is he?\" Mary asked.</p>\n<p>\"Doesn't tha' know? He's a robin redbreast an' they're th'</p>\n<p>friendliest, curiousest birds alive. They're almost as friendly as dogs--if</p>\n<p>you know how to get on with 'em. Watch him</p>\n<p>peckin' about there an' lookin' round at us now an'</p>\n<p>again. He knows we're talkin' about him.\"</p>\n<p>It was the queerest thing in the world to see</p>",
        "<p>the old fellow. He looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated</p>\n<p>bird as if he were both proud and fond of</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>\"He's a conceited one,\" he chuckled. \"He likes to hear</p>\n<p>folk talk about him. An' curious--bless me, there never was</p>\n<p>his like for curiosity an' meddlin'. He's always comin' to</p>\n<p>see what I'm plantin'. He knows all th' things Mester</p>",
        "<p>Craven never troubles hissel' to find out. He's th' head</p>\n<p>gardener, he is.\"</p>\n<p>The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now</p>\n<p>and then stopped and looked at them a little. Mary</p>\n<p>thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great</p>\n<p>curiosity. It really seemed as if he were finding out</p>\n<p>all about her. The queer feeling in her heart increased.</p>",
        "<p>\"Where did the rest of the brood fly to?\" she</p>\n<p>asked.</p>\n<p>\"There's no knowin'. The old ones turn 'em out o'</p>\n<p>their nest an' make 'em fly an' they're scattered before</p>\n<p>you know it. This one was a knowin' one an'</p>\n<p>he knew he was lonely.\"</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and</p>",
        "<p>looked at him very hard.</p>\n<p>\"I'm lonely,\" she said.</p>\n<p>She had not known before that this was one of</p>\n<p>the things which made her feel sour and cross. She</p>\n<p>seemed to find it out when the robin looked at</p>\n<p>her and she looked at the robin.</p>\n<p>The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald</p>",
        "<p>head and stared at her a minute.</p>\n<p>\"Art tha' th' little wench from India?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Then no wonder tha'rt lonely. Tha'lt be lonelier before tha's</p>\n<p>done,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into</p>\n<p>the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about</p>",
        "<p>very busily employed.</p>\n<p>\"What is your name?\" Mary inquired.</p>\n<p>He stood up to answer her.</p>\n<p>\"Ben Weatherstaff,\" he answered, and then he added with a</p>\n<p>surly chuckle, \"I'm lonely mysel' except when he's with me,\"</p>\n<p>and he jerked his thumb toward the robin. \"He's th'</p>\n<p>only friend I've got.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I have no friends at all,\" said Mary. \"I never</p>\n<p>had. My Ayah didn't like me and I never played</p>\n<p>with any one.\"</p>\n<p>It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think</p>\n<p>with blunt frankness, and old Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire</p>\n<p>moor man.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' an' me are a good bit alike,\" he said.</p>",
        "<p>\"We was wove out of th' same cloth. We're neither</p>\n<p>of us good lookin' an' we're both of us as</p>\n<p>sour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers,</p>\n<p>both of us, I'll warrant.\"</p>\n<p>This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard</p>\n<p>the truth about herself in her life. Native servants always</p>\n<p>salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did. She had</p>",
        "<p>never thought much about her looks, but she wondered if</p>\n<p>she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she also</p>\n<p>wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked</p>\n<p>before the robin came. She actually began to wonder also</p>\n<p>if she was \"nasty tempered.\" She felt uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her</p>\n<p>and she turned round. She was standing a few feet</p>",
        "<p>from a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on</p>\n<p>to one of its branches and had burst out into</p>\n<p>a scrap of a song. Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.</p>\n<p>\"What did he do that for?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"He's made up his mind to make friends with thee,\"</p>\n<p>replied Ben. \"Dang me if he hasn't took a fancy</p>\n<p>to thee.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"To me?\" said Mary, and she moved toward the little</p>\n<p>tree softly and looked up.</p>\n<p>\"Would you make friends with me?\" she said to the</p>\n<p>robin just as if she was speaking to a person.</p>\n<p>\"Would you?\" And she did not say it either in</p>\n<p>her hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice,</p>\n<p>but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing</p>",
        "<p>that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as she had been</p>\n<p>when she heard him whistle.</p>\n<p>\"Why,\" he cried out, \"tha' said that as nice an'</p>\n<p>human as if tha' was a real child instead of</p>\n<p>a sharp old woman. Tha' said it almost like Dickon</p>\n<p>talks to his wild things on th' moor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you know Dickon?\" Mary asked, turning round rather in</p>",
        "<p>a hurry.</p>\n<p>\"Everybody knows him. Dickon's wanderin' about everywhere. Th' very blackberries</p>\n<p>an' heather-bells knows him. I warrant th' foxes shows him</p>\n<p>where their cubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide their</p>\n<p>nests from him.\"</p>\n<p>Mary would have liked to ask some more questions. She</p>\n<p>was almost as curious about Dickon as she was about</p>",
        "<p>the deserted garden. But just that moment the robin, who</p>\n<p>had ended his song, gave a little shake of his</p>\n<p>wings, spread them and flew away. He had made his</p>\n<p>visit and had other things to do.</p>\n<p>\"He has flown over the wall!\" Mary cried out, watching</p>\n<p>him. \"He has flown into the orchard--he has flown across</p>\n<p>the other wall--into the garden where there is no door!\"</p>",
        "<p>\"He lives there,\" said old Ben. \"He came out o'</p>\n<p>th' egg there. If he's courtin', he's makin' up to</p>\n<p>some young madam of a robin that lives among th'</p>\n<p>old rose-trees there.\"</p>\n<p>\"Rose-trees,\" said Mary. \"Are there rose-trees?\"</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to</p>\n<p>dig.</p>",
        "<p>\"There was ten year' ago,\" he mumbled.</p>\n<p>\"I should like to see them,\" said Mary. \"Where is</p>\n<p>the green door? There must be a door somewhere.\"</p>\n<p>Ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as</p>\n<p>he had looked when she first saw him.</p>\n<p>\"There was ten year' ago, but there isn't now,\" he</p>\n<p>said.</p>",
        "<p>\"No door!\" cried Mary. \"There must be.\"</p>\n<p>\"None as any one can find, an' none as is</p>\n<p>any one's business. Don't you be a meddlesome wench an'</p>\n<p>poke your nose where it's no cause to go. Here,</p>\n<p>I must go on with my work. Get you gone</p>\n<p>an' play you. I've no more time.\"</p>\n<p>And he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his</p>",
        "<p>shoulder and walked off, without even glancing at her or</p>\n<p>saying good-by.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>\n<p>THE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR</p>\n<p>At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox</p>\n<p>was exactly like the others. Every morning she awoke in</p>\n<p>her tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon the hearth</p>\n<p>building her fire; every morning she ate her breakfast in</p>\n<p>the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after</p>\n<p>each breakfast she gazed out of the window across to</p>",
        "<p>the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all</p>\n<p>sides and climb up to the sky, and after she</p>\n<p>had stared for a while she realized that if she</p>\n<p>did not go out she would have to stay in</p>\n<p>and do nothing--and so she went out. She did not</p>\n<p>know that this was the best thing she could have</p>\n<p>done, and she did not know that, when she began</p>",
        "<p>to walk quickly or even run along the paths and</p>\n<p>down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and</p>\n<p>making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept</p>\n<p>down from the moor. She ran only to make herself</p>\n<p>warm, and she hated the wind which rushed at her</p>\n<p>face and roared and held her back as if it</p>\n<p>were some giant she could not see. But the big</p>",
        "<p>breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled</p>\n<p>her lungs with something which was good for her whole</p>\n<p>thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks</p>\n<p>and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know</p>\n<p>anything about it.</p>\n<p>But after a few days spent almost entirely out of</p>\n<p>doors she wakened one morning knowing what it was to</p>",
        "<p>be hungry, and when she sat down to her breakfast</p>\n<p>she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push</p>\n<p>it away, but took up her spoon and began to</p>\n<p>eat it and went on eating it until her bowl</p>\n<p>was empty.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' got on well enough with that this mornin', didn't</p>\n<p>tha'?\" said Martha.</p>",
        "<p>\"It tastes nice to-day,\" said Mary, feeling a little surprised</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n<p>\"It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach</p>\n<p>for tha' victuals,\" answered Martha. \"It's lucky for thee that</p>\n<p>tha's got victuals as well as appetite. There's been twelve</p>\n<p>in our cottage as had th' stomach an' nothin' to</p>\n<p>put in it. You go on playin' you out o'</p>",
        "<p>doors every day an' you'll get some flesh on your</p>\n<p>bones an' you won't be so yeller.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't play,\" said Mary. \"I have nothing to play</p>\n<p>with.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothin' to play with!\" exclaimed Martha. \"Our children plays with</p>\n<p>sticks and stones. They just runs about an' shouts an'</p>\n<p>looks at things.\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There</p>\n<p>was nothing else to do. She walked round and round</p>\n<p>the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park.</p>\n<p>Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though several times</p>\n<p>she saw him at work he was too busy to</p>\n<p>look at her or was too surly. Once when she</p>\n<p>was walking toward him he picked up his spade and</p>",
        "<p>turned away as if he did it on purpose.</p>\n<p>One place she went to oftener than to any other.</p>\n<p>It was the long walk outside the gardens with the</p>\n<p>walls round them. There were bare flower-beds on either side</p>\n<p>of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly. There</p>\n<p>was one part of the wall where the creeping dark</p>\n<p>green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as</p>",
        "<p>if for a long time that part had been neglected.</p>\n<p>The rest of it had been clipped and made to</p>\n<p>look neat, but at this lower end of the walk</p>\n<p>it had not been trimmed at all.</p>\n<p>A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff</p>\n<p>Mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was</p>\n<p>so. She had just paused and was looking up at</p>",
        "<p>a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when</p>\n<p>she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant</p>\n<p>chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, perched</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her</p>\n<p>with his small head on one side.</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" she cried out, \"is it you--is it you?\" And</p>\n<p>it did not seem at all queer to her that</p>",
        "<p>she spoke to him as if she was sure that</p>\n<p>he would understand and answer her.</p>\n<p>He did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along</p>\n<p>the wall as if he were telling her all sorts</p>\n<p>of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary as if she</p>\n<p>understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words.</p>\n<p>It was as if he said:</p>",
        "<p>\"Good morning! Isn't the wind nice? Isn't the sun nice?</p>\n<p>Isn't everything nice? Let us both chirp and hop and</p>\n<p>twitter. Come on! Come on!\"</p>\n<p>Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took</p>\n<p>little flights along the wall she ran after him. Poor</p>\n<p>little thin, sallow, ugly Mary--she actually looked almost pretty for</p>\n<p>a moment.</p>",
        "<p>\"I like you! I like you!\" she cried out, pattering</p>\n<p>down the walk; and she chirped and tried to whistle,</p>\n<p>which last she did not know how to do in</p>\n<p>the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied</p>\n<p>and chirped and whistled back at her. At last he</p>\n<p>spread his wings and made a darting flight to the</p>\n<p>top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.</p>",
        "<p>That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen</p>\n<p>him. He had been swinging on a tree-top then and</p>\n<p>she had been standing in the orchard. Now she was</p>\n<p>on the other side of the orchard and standing in</p>\n<p>the path outside a wall--much lower down--and there was the</p>\n<p>same tree inside.</p>\n<p>\"It's in the garden no one can go into,\" she</p>",
        "<p>said to herself. \"It's the garden without a door. He</p>\n<p>lives in there. How I wish I could see what</p>\n<p>it is like!\"</p>\n<p>She ran up the walk to the green door she</p>\n<p>had entered the first morning. Then she ran down the</p>\n<p>path through the other door and then into the orchard,</p>\n<p>and when she stood and looked up there was the</p>",
        "<p>tree on the other side of the wall, and there</p>\n<p>was the robin just finishing his song and beginning to</p>\n<p>preen his feathers with his beak.</p>\n<p>\"It is the garden,\" she said. \"I am sure it</p>\n<p>is.\"</p>\n<p>She walked round and looked closely at that side of</p>\n<p>the orchard wall, but she only found what she had</p>",
        "<p>found before--that there was no door in it. Then she</p>\n<p>ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk</p>\n<p>outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the</p>\n<p>end of it and looked at it, but there was</p>\n<p>no door; and then she walked to the other end,</p>\n<p>looking again, but there was no door.</p>\n<p>\"It's very queer,\" she said. \"Ben Weatherstaff said there was</p>",
        "<p>no door and there is no door. But there must</p>\n<p>have been one ten years ago, because Mr. Craven buried</p>\n<p>the key.\"</p>\n<p>This gave her so much to think of that she</p>\n<p>began to be quite interested and feel that she was</p>\n<p>not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite Manor. In</p>\n<p>India she had always felt hot and too languid to</p>",
        "<p>care much about anything. The fact was that the fresh</p>\n<p>wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs</p>\n<p>out of her young brain and to waken her up</p>\n<p>a little.</p>\n<p>She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when</p>\n<p>she sat down to her supper at night she felt</p>\n<p>hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did not feel cross</p>",
        "<p>when Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather</p>\n<p>liked to hear her, and at last she thought she</p>\n<p>would ask her a question. She asked it after she</p>\n<p>had finished her supper and had sat down on the</p>\n<p>hearth-rug before the fire.</p>\n<p>\"Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?\" she said.</p>\n<p>She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had</p>",
        "<p>not objected at all. She was very young, and used</p>\n<p>to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and</p>\n<p>she found it dull in the great servants' hall down-stairs</p>\n<p>where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire</p>\n<p>speech and looked upon her as a common little thing,</p>\n<p>and sat and whispered among themselves. Martha liked to talk,</p>\n<p>and the strange child who had lived in India, and</p>",
        "<p>been waited upon by \"blacks,\" was novelty enough to attract</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to</p>\n<p>be asked.</p>\n<p>\"Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet?\" she said. \"I</p>\n<p>knew tha' would. That was just the way with me</p>\n<p>when I first heard about it.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Why did he hate it?\" Mary persisted.</p>\n<p>Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite</p>\n<p>comfortable.</p>\n<p>\"Listen to th' wind wutherin' round the house,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"You could bare stand up on the moor if you</p>\n<p>was out on it to-night.\"</p>\n<p>Mary did not know what \"wutherin'\" meant until she listened,</p>",
        "<p>and then she understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering</p>\n<p>sort of roar which rushed round and round the house</p>\n<p>as if the giant no one could see were buffeting</p>\n<p>it and beating at the walls and windows to try</p>\n<p>to break in. But one knew he could not get</p>\n<p>in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and</p>\n<p>warm inside a room with a red coal fire.</p>",
        "<p>\"But why did he hate it so?\" she asked, after</p>\n<p>she had listened. She intended to know if Martha did.</p>\n<p>Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.</p>\n<p>\"Mind,\" she said, \"Mrs. Medlock said it's not to be</p>\n<p>talked about. There's lots o' things in this place that's</p>\n<p>not to be talked over. That's Mr. Craven's orders. His</p>\n<p>troubles are none servants' business, he says. But for th'</p>",
        "<p>garden he wouldn't be like he is. It was Mrs.</p>\n<p>Craven's garden that she had made when first they were</p>\n<p>married an' she just loved it, an' they used to</p>\n<p>'tend the flowers themselves. An' none o' th' gardeners was</p>\n<p>ever let to go in. Him an' her used to</p>\n<p>go in an' shut th' door an' stay there hours</p>\n<p>an' hours, readin' an' talkin'. An' she was just a</p>",
        "<p>bit of a girl an' there was an old tree</p>\n<p>with a branch bent like a seat on it. An'</p>\n<p>she made roses grow over it an' she used to</p>\n<p>sit there. But one day when she was sittin' there</p>\n<p>th' branch broke an' she fell on th' ground an'</p>\n<p>was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th'</p>\n<p>doctors thought he'd go out o' his mind an' die,</p>",
        "<p>too. That's why he hates it. No one's never gone</p>\n<p>in since, an' he won't let any one talk about</p>\n<p>it.\"</p>\n<p>Mary did not ask any more questions. She looked at</p>\n<p>the red fire and listened to the wind \"wutherin'.\" It</p>\n<p>seemed to be \"wutherin'\" louder than ever.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very good thing was happening to</p>",
        "<p>her. Four good things had happened to her, in fact,</p>\n<p>since she came to Misselthwaite Manor. She had felt as</p>\n<p>if she had understood a robin and that he had</p>\n<p>understood her; she had run in the wind until her</p>\n<p>blood had grown warm; she had been healthily hungry for</p>\n<p>the first time in her life; and she had found</p>\n<p>out what it was to be sorry for some one.</p>",
        "<p>She was getting on.</p>\n<p>But as she was listening to the wind she began</p>\n<p>to listen to something else. She did not know what</p>\n<p>it was, because at first she could scarcely distinguish it</p>\n<p>from the wind itself. It was a curious sound--it seemed</p>\n<p>almost as if a child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the</p>\n<p>wind sounded rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress</p>",
        "<p>Mary felt quite sure that this sound was inside the</p>\n<p>house, not outside it. It was far away, but it</p>\n<p>was inside. She turned round and looked at Martha.</p>\n<p>\"Do you hear any one crying?\" she said.</p>\n<p>Martha suddenly looked confused.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" she answered. \"It's th' wind. Sometimes it sounds like</p>\n<p>as if some one was lost on th' moor an'</p>",
        "<p>wailin'. It's got all sorts o' sounds.\"</p>\n<p>\"But listen,\" said Mary. \"It's in the house--down one of</p>\n<p>those long corridors.\"</p>\n<p>And at that very moment a door must have been</p>\n<p>opened somewhere down-stairs; for a great rushing draft blew along</p>\n<p>the passage and the door of the room they sat</p>\n<p>in was blown open with a crash, and as they</p>",
        "<p>both jumped to their feet the light was blown out</p>\n<p>and the crying sound was swept down the far corridor</p>\n<p>so that it was to be heard more plainly than</p>\n<p>ever.</p>\n<p>\"There!\" said Mary. \"I told you so! It is some</p>\n<p>one crying--and it isn't a grown-up person.\"</p>\n<p>Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key,</p>",
        "<p>but before she did it they both heard the sound</p>\n<p>of a door in some far passage shutting with a</p>\n<p>bang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind</p>\n<p>ceased \"wutherin'\" for a few moments.</p>\n<p>\"It was th' wind,\" said Martha stubbornly. \"An' if it</p>\n<p>wasn't, it was little Betty Butterworth, th' scullery-maid. She's had</p>\n<p>th' toothache all day.\"</p>",
        "<p>But something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress</p>\n<p>Mary stare very hard at her. She did not believe</p>\n<p>she was speaking the truth.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>\n<p>\"THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYING--THERE WAS!\"</p>\n<p>The next day the rain poured down in torrents again,</p>\n<p>and when Mary looked out of her window the moor</p>\n<p>was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud. There could</p>\n<p>be no going out to-day.</p>\n<p>\"What do you do in your cottage when it rains</p>\n<p>like this?\" she asked Martha.</p>",
        "<p>\"Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly,\" Martha</p>\n<p>answered. \"Eh! there does seem a lot of us then.</p>\n<p>Mother's a good-tempered woman but she gets fair moithered. The</p>\n<p>biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and plays there.</p>\n<p>Dickon he doesn't mind th' wet. He goes out just</p>\n<p>th' same as if th' sun was shinin'. He says</p>\n<p>he sees things on rainy days as doesn't show when</p>",
        "<p>it's fair weather. He once found a little fox cub</p>\n<p>half drowned in its hole and he brought it home</p>\n<p>in th' bosom of his shirt to keep it warm.</p>\n<p>Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was</p>\n<p>swum out an' th' rest o' th' litter was dead.</p>\n<p>He's got it at home now. He found a half-drowned</p>\n<p>young crow another time an' he brought it home, too,</p>",
        "<p>an' tamed it. It's named Soot because it's so black,</p>\n<p>an' it hops an' flies about with him everywhere.\"</p>\n<p>The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent</p>\n<p>Martha's familiar talk. She had even begun to find it</p>\n<p>interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went</p>\n<p>away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah</p>\n<p>when she lived in India had been quite unlike those</p>",
        "<p>Martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held</p>\n<p>fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never</p>\n<p>had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to tumble</p>\n<p>about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured</p>\n<p>collie puppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and</p>\n<p>Dickon. When Martha told stories of what \"mother\" said or</p>\n<p>did they always sounded comfortable.</p>",
        "<p>\"If I had a raven or a fox cub I</p>\n<p>could play with it,\" said Mary. \"But I have nothing.\"</p>\n<p>Martha looked perplexed.</p>\n<p>\"Can tha' knit?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" answered Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Can tha' sew?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Can tha' read?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then why doesn't tha' read somethin', or learn a bit</p>\n<p>o' spellin'? Tha'st old enough to be learnin' thy book</p>\n<p>a good bit now.\"</p>\n<p>\"I haven't any books,\" said Mary. \"Those I had were</p>\n<p>left in India.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"That's a pity,\" said Martha. \"If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee</p>\n<p>go into th' library, there's thousands o' books there.\"</p>\n<p>Mary did not ask where the library was, because she</p>\n<p>was suddenly inspired by a new idea. She made up</p>\n<p>her mind to go and find it herself. She was</p>\n<p>not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always to</p>\n<p>be in her comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room down-stairs. In this queer</p>",
        "<p>place one scarcely ever saw any one at all. In</p>\n<p>fact, there was no one to see but the servants,</p>\n<p>and when their master was away they lived a luxurious</p>\n<p>life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung</p>\n<p>about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants'</p>\n<p>hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten</p>\n<p>every day, and where a great deal of lively romping</p>",
        "<p>went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.</p>\n<p>Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her,</p>\n<p>but no one troubled themselves about her in the least.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her every day or</p>\n<p>two, but no one inquired what she did or told</p>\n<p>her what to do. She supposed that perhaps this was</p>\n<p>the English way of treating children. In India she had</p>",
        "<p>always been attended by her Ayah, who had followed her</p>\n<p>about and waited on her, hand and foot. She had</p>\n<p>often been tired of her company. Now she was followed</p>\n<p>by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha</p>\n<p>looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid</p>\n<p>when she wanted to have things handed to her and</p>\n<p>put on.</p>",
        "<p>\"Hasn't tha' got good sense?\" she said once, when Mary</p>\n<p>had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves</p>\n<p>for her. \"Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as</p>\n<p>thee an' she's only four year' old. Sometimes tha' looks</p>\n<p>fair soft in th' head.\"</p>\n<p>Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after</p>\n<p>that, but it made her think several entirely new things.</p>",
        "<p>She stood at the window for about ten minutes this</p>\n<p>morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the</p>\n<p>last time and gone down-stairs. She was thinking over the</p>\n<p>new idea which had come to her when she heard</p>\n<p>of the library. She did not care very much about</p>\n<p>the library itself, because she had read very few books;</p>\n<p>but to hear of it brought back to her mind</p>",
        "<p>the hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they</p>\n<p>were all really locked and what she would find if</p>\n<p>she could get into any of them. Were there a</p>\n<p>hundred really? Why shouldn't she go and see how many</p>\n<p>doors she could count? It would be something to do</p>\n<p>on this morning when she could not go out. She</p>\n<p>had never been taught to ask permission to do things,</p>",
        "<p>and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she</p>\n<p>would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock</p>\n<p>if she might walk about the house, even if she</p>\n<p>had seen her.</p>\n<p>She opened the door of the room and went into</p>\n<p>the corridor, and then she began her wanderings. It was</p>\n<p>a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and</p>",
        "<p>it led her up short flights of steps which mounted</p>\n<p>to others again. There were doors and doors, and there</p>\n<p>were pictures on the walls. Sometimes they were pictures of</p>\n<p>dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men</p>\n<p>and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and</p>\n<p>velvet. She found herself in one long gallery whose walls</p>\n<p>were covered with these portraits. She had never thought there</p>",
        "<p>could be so many in any house. She walked slowly</p>\n<p>down this place and stared at the faces which also</p>\n<p>seemed to stare at her. She felt as if they</p>\n<p>were wondering what a little girl from India was doing</p>\n<p>in their house. Some were pictures of children--little girls in</p>\n<p>thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood</p>\n<p>out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace</p>",
        "<p>collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their</p>\n<p>necks. She always stopped to look at the children, and</p>\n<p>wonder what their names were, and where they had gone,</p>\n<p>and why they wore such odd clothes. There was a</p>\n<p>stiff, plain little girl rather like herself. She wore a</p>\n<p>green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her</p>\n<p>finger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.</p>",
        "<p>\"Where do you live now?\" said Mary aloud to her.</p>\n<p>\"I wish you were here.\"</p>\n<p>Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer</p>\n<p>morning. It seemed as if there was no one in</p>\n<p>all the huge rambling house but her own small self,</p>\n<p>wandering about up-stairs and down, through narrow passages and wide</p>\n<p>ones, where it seemed to her that no one but</p>",
        "<p>herself had ever walked. Since so many rooms had been</p>\n<p>built, people must have lived in them, but it all</p>\n<p>seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it</p>\n<p>true.</p>\n<p>It was not until she climbed to the second floor</p>\n<p>that she thought of turning the handle of a door.</p>\n<p>All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said</p>",
        "<p>they were, but at last she put her hand on</p>\n<p>the handle of one of them and turned it. She</p>\n<p>was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that</p>\n<p>it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon</p>\n<p>the door itself it slowly and heavily opened. It was</p>\n<p>a massive door and opened into a big bedroom. There</p>\n<p>were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such</p>",
        "<p>as she had seen in India stood about the room.</p>\n<p>A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the</p>\n<p>moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the</p>\n<p>stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her</p>\n<p>more curiously than ever.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps she slept here once,\" said Mary. \"She stares at</p>\n<p>me so that she makes me feel queer.\"</p>",
        "<p>After that she opened more doors and more. She saw</p>\n<p>so many rooms that she became quite tired and began</p>\n<p>to think that there must be a hundred, though she</p>\n<p>had not counted them. In all of them there were</p>\n<p>old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on</p>\n<p>them. There were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments</p>\n<p>in nearly all of them.</p>",
        "<p>In one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the</p>\n<p>hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were</p>\n<p>about a hundred little elephants made of ivory. They were</p>\n<p>of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or palanquins</p>\n<p>on their backs. Some were much bigger than the others</p>\n<p>and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies.</p>\n<p>Mary had seen carved ivory in India and she knew</p>",
        "<p>all about elephants. She opened the door of the cabinet</p>\n<p>and stood on a footstool and played with these for</p>\n<p>quite a long time. When she got tired she set</p>\n<p>the elephants in order and shut the door of the</p>\n<p>cabinet.</p>\n<p>In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the</p>\n<p>empty rooms, she had seen nothing alive; but in this</p>",
        "<p>room she saw something. Just after she had closed the</p>\n<p>cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound. It made</p>\n<p>her jump and look around at the sofa by the</p>\n<p>fireplace, from which it seemed to come. In the corner</p>\n<p>of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the</p>\n<p>velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out</p>\n<p>of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair</p>",
        "<p>of frightened eyes in it.</p>\n<p>Mary crept softly across the room to look. The bright</p>\n<p>eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse</p>\n<p>had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a</p>\n<p>comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep</p>\n<p>near her. If there was no one else alive in</p>\n<p>the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not</p>",
        "<p>look lonely at all.</p>\n<p>\"If they wouldn't be so frightened I would take them</p>\n<p>back with me,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired</p>\n<p>to wander any farther, and she turned back. Two or</p>\n<p>three times she lost her way by turning down the</p>\n<p>wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down</p>",
        "<p>until she found the right one; but at last she</p>\n<p>reached her own floor again, though she was some distance</p>\n<p>from her own room and did not know exactly where</p>\n<p>she was.</p>\n<p>\"I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,\" she</p>\n<p>said, standing still at what seemed the end of a</p>\n<p>short passage with tapestry on the wall. \"I don't know</p>",
        "<p>which way to go. How still everything is!\"</p>\n<p>It was while she was standing here and just after</p>\n<p>she had said this that the stillness was broken by</p>\n<p>a sound. It was another cry, but not quite like</p>\n<p>the one she had heard last night; it was only</p>\n<p>a short one, a fretful, childish whine muffled by passing</p>\n<p>through walls.</p>",
        "<p>\"It's nearer than it was,\" said Mary, her heart beating</p>\n<p>rather faster. \"And it _is_ crying.\"</p>\n<p>She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her,</p>\n<p>and then sprang back, feeling quite startled. The tapestry was</p>\n<p>the covering of a door which fell open and showed</p>\n<p>her that there was another part of the corridor behind</p>\n<p>it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her</p>",
        "<p>bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross</p>\n<p>look on her face.</p>\n<p>\"What are you doing here?\" she said, and she took</p>\n<p>Mary by the arm and pulled her away. \"What did</p>\n<p>I tell you?\"</p>\n<p>\"I turned round the wrong corner,\" explained Mary. \"I didn't</p>\n<p>know which way to go and I heard some one</p>",
        "<p>crying.\"</p>\n<p>She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she</p>\n<p>hated her more the next.</p>\n<p>\"You didn't hear anything of the sort,\" said the housekeeper.</p>\n<p>\"You come along back to your own nursery or I'll</p>\n<p>box your ears.\"</p>\n<p>And she took her by the arm and half pushed,</p>",
        "<p>half pulled her up one passage and down another until</p>\n<p>she pushed her in at the door of her own</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>\"Now,\" she said, \"you stay where you're told to stay</p>\n<p>or you'll find yourself locked up. The master had better</p>\n<p>get you a governess, same as he said he would.</p>\n<p>You're one that needs some one to look sharp after</p>",
        "<p>you. I've got enough to do.\"</p>\n<p>She went out of the room and slammed the door</p>\n<p>after her, and Mary went and sat on the hearth-rug,</p>\n<p>pale with rage. She did not cry, but ground her</p>\n<p>teeth.</p>\n<p>\"There _was_ some one crying--there _was_--there _was_!\" she said to</p>\n<p>herself.</p>",
        "<p>She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would</p>\n<p>find out. She had found out a great deal this</p>\n<p>morning. She felt as if she had been on a</p>\n<p>long journey, and at any rate she had had something</p>\n<p>to amuse her all the time, and she had played</p>\n<p>with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse</p>\n<p>and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>\n<p>THE KEY OF THE GARDEN</p>\n<p>Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she</p>\n<p>sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Martha.</p>\n<p>\"Look at the moor! Look at the moor!\"</p>\n<p>The rain-storm had ended and the gray mist and clouds</p>\n<p>had been swept away in the night by the wind.</p>\n<p>The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue</p>",
        "<p>sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never had Mary</p>\n<p>dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were</p>\n<p>hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue</p>\n<p>which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some</p>\n<p>lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in</p>\n<p>the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. The</p>\n<p>far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead</p>",
        "<p>of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.</p>\n<p>\"Aye,\" said Martha with a cheerful grin. \"Th' storm's over</p>\n<p>for a bit. It does like this at this time</p>\n<p>o' th' year. It goes off in a night like</p>\n<p>it was pretendin' it had never been here an' never</p>\n<p>meant to come again. That's because th' springtime's on its</p>\n<p>way. It's a long way off yet, but it's comin'.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in</p>\n<p>England,\" Mary said.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! no!\" said Martha, sitting up on her heels among</p>\n<p>her black lead brushes. \"Nowt o' th' soart!\"</p>\n<p>\"What does that mean?\" asked Mary seriously. In India the</p>\n<p>natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood,</p>\n<p>so she was not surprised when Martha used words she</p>",
        "<p>did not know.</p>\n<p>Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.</p>\n<p>\"There now,\" she said. \"I've talked broad Yorkshire again like</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock said I mustn't. 'Nowt o' th' soart' means</p>\n<p>'nothin'-of-the-sort,'\" slowly and carefully, \"but it takes so long to</p>\n<p>say it. Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth when it</p>\n<p>is sunny. I told thee tha'd like th' moor after</p>",
        "<p>a bit. Just you wait till you see th' gold-colored</p>\n<p>gorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th' broom, an' th'</p>\n<p>heather flowerin', all purple bells, an' hundreds o' butterflies flutterin'</p>\n<p>an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin' up an' singin'. You'll</p>\n<p>want to get out on it at sunrise an' live</p>\n<p>out on it all day like Dickon does.\"</p>\n<p>\"Could I ever get there?\" asked Mary wistfully, looking through</p>",
        "<p>her window at the far-off blue. It was so new</p>\n<p>and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know,\" answered Martha. \"Tha's never used tha' legs</p>\n<p>since tha' was born, it seems to me. Tha' couldn't</p>\n<p>walk five mile. It's five mile to our cottage.\"</p>\n<p>\"I should like to see your cottage.\"</p>\n<p>Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took</p>",
        "<p>up her polishing brush and began to rub the grate</p>\n<p>again. She was thinking that the small plain face did</p>\n<p>not look quite as sour at this moment as it</p>\n<p>had done the first morning she saw it. It looked</p>\n<p>just a trifle like little Susan Ann's when she wanted</p>\n<p>something very much.</p>\n<p>\"I'll ask my mother about it,\" she said. \"She's one</p>",
        "<p>o' them that nearly always sees a way to do</p>\n<p>things. It's my day out to-day an' I'm goin' home.</p>\n<p>Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o'</p>\n<p>mother. Perhaps she could talk to her.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like your mother,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I should think tha' did,\" agreed Martha, polishing away.</p>\n<p>\"I've never seen her,\" said Mary.</p>",
        "<p>\"No, tha' hasn't,\" replied Martha.</p>\n<p>She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the</p>\n<p>end of her nose with the back of her hand</p>\n<p>as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite</p>\n<p>positively.</p>\n<p>\"Well, she's that sensible an' hard workin' an' good-natured an'</p>\n<p>clean that no one could help likin' her whether they'd</p>",
        "<p>seen her or not. When I'm goin' home to her</p>\n<p>on my day out I just jump for joy when</p>\n<p>I'm crossin' th' moor.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like Dickon,\" added Mary. \"And I've never seen him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said Martha stoutly, \"I've told thee that th' very</p>\n<p>birds likes him an' th' rabbits an' wild sheep an'</p>\n<p>ponies, an' th' foxes themselves. I wonder,\" staring at her</p>",
        "<p>reflectively, \"what Dickon would think of thee?\"</p>\n<p>\"He wouldn't like me,\" said Mary in her stiff, cold</p>\n<p>little way. \"No one does.\"</p>\n<p>Martha looked reflective again.</p>\n<p>\"How does tha' like thysel'?\" she inquired, really quite as</p>\n<p>if she were curious to know.</p>\n<p>Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.</p>",
        "<p>\"Not at all--really,\" she answered. \"But I never thought of</p>\n<p>that before.\"</p>\n<p>Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.</p>\n<p>\"Mother said that to me once,\" she said. \"She was</p>\n<p>at her wash-tub an' I was in a bad temper</p>\n<p>an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she turns round on</p>\n<p>me an' says: 'Tha' young vixon, tha'! There tha' stands</p>",
        "<p>sayin' tha' doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like</p>\n<p>that one. How does tha' like thysel'?' It made me</p>\n<p>laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a</p>\n<p>minute.\"</p>\n<p>She went away in high spirits as soon as she</p>\n<p>had given Mary her breakfast. She was going to walk</p>\n<p>five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she</p>",
        "<p>was going to help her mother with the washing and</p>\n<p>do the week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.</p>\n<p>Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was</p>\n<p>no longer in the house. She went out into the</p>\n<p>garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she</p>\n<p>did was to run round and round the fountain flower</p>\n<p>garden ten times. She counted the times carefully and when</p>",
        "<p>she had finished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine</p>\n<p>made the whole place look different. The high, deep, blue</p>\n<p>sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor,</p>\n<p>and she kept lifting her face and looking up into</p>\n<p>it, trying to imagine what it would be like to</p>\n<p>lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and</p>\n<p>float about. She went into the first kitchen-garden and found</p>",
        "<p>Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners. The change</p>\n<p>in the weather seemed to have done him good. He</p>\n<p>spoke to her of his own accord.</p>\n<p>\"Springtime's comin',\" he said. \"Cannot tha' smell it?\"</p>\n<p>Mary sniffed and thought she could.</p>\n<p>\"I smell something nice and fresh and damp,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"That's th' good rich earth,\" he answered, digging away. \"It's</p>",
        "<p>in a good humor makin' ready to grow things. It's</p>\n<p>glad when plantin' time comes. It's dull in th' winter</p>\n<p>when it's got nowt to do. In th' flower gardens</p>\n<p>out there things will be stirrin' down below in th'</p>\n<p>dark. Th' sun's warmin' 'em. You'll see bits o' green</p>\n<p>spikes stickin' out o' th' black earth after a bit.\"</p>\n<p>\"What will they be?\" asked Mary.</p>",
        "<p>\"Crocuses an' snowdrops an' daffydowndillys. Has tha' never seen them?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the</p>\n<p>rains in India,\" said Mary. \"And I think things grow</p>\n<p>up in a night.\"</p>\n<p>\"These won't grow up in a night,\" said Weatherstaff. \"Tha'll</p>\n<p>have to wait for 'em. They'll poke up a bit</p>\n<p>higher here, an' push out a spike more there, an'</p>",
        "<p>uncurl a leaf this day an' another that. You watch</p>\n<p>'em.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am going to,\" answered Mary.</p>\n<p>Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings</p>\n<p>again and she knew at once that the robin had</p>\n<p>come again. He was very pert and lively, and hopped</p>\n<p>about so close to her feet, and put his head</p>",
        "<p>on one side and looked at her so slyly that</p>\n<p>she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.</p>\n<p>\"Do you think he remembers me?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Remembers thee!\" said Weatherstaff indignantly. \"He knows every cabbage stump</p>\n<p>in th' gardens, let alone th' people. He's never seen</p>\n<p>a little wench here before, an' he's bent on findin'</p>\n<p>out all about thee. Tha's no need to try to</p>",
        "<p>hide anything from _him_.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are things stirring down below in the dark in that</p>\n<p>garden where he lives?\" Mary inquired.</p>\n<p>\"What garden?\" grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.</p>\n<p>\"The one where the old rose-trees are.\" She could not</p>\n<p>help asking, because she wanted so much to know. \"Are</p>\n<p>all the flowers dead, or do some of them come</p>",
        "<p>again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ask him,\" said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the</p>\n<p>robin. \"He's the only one as knows. No one else</p>\n<p>has seen inside it for ten year'.\"</p>\n<p>Ten years was a long time, Mary thought. She had</p>\n<p>been born ten years ago.</p>\n<p>She walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like</p>",
        "<p>the garden just as she had begun to like the</p>\n<p>robin and Dickon and Martha's mother. She was beginning to</p>\n<p>like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people to</p>\n<p>like--when you were not used to liking. She thought of</p>\n<p>the robin as one of the people. She went to</p>\n<p>her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she</p>\n<p>could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked</p>",
        "<p>up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened</p>\n<p>to her, and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.</p>\n<p>She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she</p>\n<p>looked at the bare flower-bed at her left side there</p>\n<p>he was hopping about and pretending to peck things out</p>\n<p>of the earth to persuade her that he had not</p>\n<p>followed her. But she knew he had followed her and</p>",
        "<p>the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost</p>\n<p>trembled a little.</p>\n<p>\"You do remember me!\" she cried out. \"You do! You</p>\n<p>are prettier than anything else in the world!\"</p>\n<p>She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and</p>\n<p>flirted his tail and twittered. It was as if he</p>\n<p>were talking. His red waistcoat was like satin and he</p>",
        "<p>puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and</p>\n<p>so grand and so pretty that it was really as</p>\n<p>if he were showing her how important and like a</p>\n<p>human person a robin could be. Mistress Mary forgot that</p>\n<p>she had ever been contrary in her life when he</p>\n<p>allowed her to draw closer and closer to him, and</p>\n<p>bend down and talk and try to make something like</p>",
        "<p>robin sounds.</p>\n<p>Oh! to think that he should actually let her come</p>\n<p>as near to him as that! He knew nothing in</p>\n<p>the world would make her put out her hand toward</p>\n<p>him or startle him in the least tiniest way. He</p>\n<p>knew it because he was a real person--only nicer than</p>\n<p>any other person in the world. She was so happy</p>",
        "<p>that she scarcely dared to breathe.</p>\n<p>The flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of</p>\n<p>flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for</p>\n<p>their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low</p>\n<p>ones which grew together at the back of the bed,</p>\n<p>and as the robin hopped about under them she saw</p>\n<p>him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up</p>",
        "<p>earth. He stopped on it to look for a worm.</p>\n<p>The earth had been turned up because a dog had</p>\n<p>been trying to dig up a mole and he had</p>\n<p>scratched quite a deep hole.</p>\n<p>Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole</p>\n<p>was there, and as she looked she saw something almost</p>\n<p>buried in the newly-turned soil. It was something like a</p>",
        "<p>ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin</p>\n<p>flew up into a tree nearby she put out her</p>\n<p>hand and picked the ring up. It was more than</p>\n<p>a ring, however; it was an old key which looked</p>\n<p>as if it had been buried a long time.</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an</p>\n<p>almost frightened face as it hung from her finger.</p>",
        "<p>\"Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,\" she said</p>\n<p>in a whisper. \"Perhaps it is the key to the</p>\n<p>garden!\"</p>"

As</p>\n<p>I have said before, she was not a child who</p>\n<p>had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders</p>\n<p>about things. All she thought about the key was that</p>\n<p>if it was the key to the closed garden, and</p>",
        "<p>she could find out where the door was, she could</p>\n<p>perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls,</p>\n<p>and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was</p>\n<p>because it had been shut up so long that she</p>\n<p>wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must</p>\n<p>be different from other places and that something strange must</p>\n<p>have happened to it during ten years. Besides that, if</p>",
        "<p>she liked it she could go into it every day</p>\n<p>and shut the door behind her, and she could make</p>\n<p>up some play of her own and play it quite</p>\n<p>alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but</p>\n<p>would think the door was still locked and the key</p>\n<p>buried in the earth. The thought of that pleased her</p>\n<p>very much.</p>",
        "<p>Living as it were, all by herself in a house</p>\n<p>with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever</p>\n<p>to do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain</p>\n<p>to working and was actually awakening her imagination. There is</p>\n<p>no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the</p>\n<p>moor had a great deal to do with it. Just</p>\n<p>as it had given her an appetite, and fighting with</p>",
        "<p>the wind had stirred her blood, so the same things</p>\n<p>had stirred her mind. In India she had always been</p>\n<p>too hot and languid and weak to care much about</p>\n<p>anything, but in this place she was beginning to care</p>\n<p>and to want to do new things. Already she felt</p>\n<p>less \"contrary,\" though she did not know why.</p>\n<p>She put the key in her pocket and walked up</p>",
        "<p>and down her walk. No one but herself ever seemed</p>\n<p>to come there, so she could walk slowly and look</p>\n<p>at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on</p>\n<p>it. The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she</p>\n<p>looked she could see nothing but thickly-growing, glossy, dark green</p>\n<p>leaves. She was very much disappointed. Something of her contrariness</p>\n<p>came back to her as she paced the walk and</p>",
        "<p>looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so</p>\n<p>silly, she said to herself, to be near it and</p>\n<p>not be able to get in. She took the key</p>\n<p>in her pocket when she went back to the house,</p>\n<p>and she made up her mind that she would always</p>\n<p>carry it with her when she went out, so that</p>\n<p>if she ever should find the hidden door she would</p>",
        "<p>be ready.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at</p>\n<p>the cottage, but she was back at her work in</p>\n<p>the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the</p>\n<p>best of spirits.</p>\n<p>\"I got up at four o'clock,\" she said. \"Eh! it</p>\n<p>was pretty on th' moor with th' birds gettin' up</p>",
        "<p>an' th' rabbits scamperin' about an' th' sun risin'. I</p>\n<p>didn't walk all th' way. A man gave me a</p>\n<p>ride in his cart an' I can tell you I</p>\n<p>did enjoy myself.\"</p>\n<p>She was full of stories of the delights of her</p>\n<p>day out. Her mother had been glad to see her</p>\n<p>and they had got the baking and washing all out</p>",
        "<p>of the way. She had even made each of the</p>\n<p>children a dough-cake with a bit of brown sugar in</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>\"I had 'em all pipin' hot when they came in</p>\n<p>from playin' on th' moor. An' th' cottage all smelt</p>\n<p>o' nice, clean hot bakin' an' there was a good</p>\n<p>fire, an' they just shouted for joy. Our Dickon he</p>",
        "<p>said our cottage was good enough for a king to</p>\n<p>live in.\"</p>\n<p>In the evening they had all sat round the fire,</p>\n<p>and Martha and her mother had sewed patches on torn</p>\n<p>clothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them about</p>\n<p>the little girl who had come from India and who</p>\n<p>had been waited on all her life by what Martha</p>",
        "<p>called \"blacks\" until she didn't know how to put on</p>\n<p>her own stockings.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! they did like to hear about you,\" said Martha.</p>\n<p>\"They wanted to know all about th' blacks an' about</p>\n<p>th' ship you came in. I couldn't tell 'em enough.\"</p>\n<p>Mary reflected a little.</p>\n<p>\"I'll tell you a great deal more before your next</p>",
        "<p>day out,\" she said, \"so that you will have more</p>\n<p>to talk about. I dare say they would like to</p>\n<p>hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the</p>\n<p>officers going to hunt tigers.\"</p>\n<p>\"My word!\" cried delighted Martha. \"It would set 'em clean</p>\n<p>off their heads. Would tha' really do that, Miss? It</p>\n<p>would be same as a wild beast show like we</p>",
        "<p>heard they had in York once.\"</p>\n<p>\"India is quite different from Yorkshire,\" Mary said slowly, as</p>\n<p>she thought the matter over. \"I never thought of that.</p>\n<p>Did Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk</p>\n<p>about me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why, our Dickon's eyes nearly started out o' his head,</p>\n<p>they got that round,\" answered Martha. \"But mother, she was</p>",
        "<p>put out about your seemin' to be all by yourself</p>\n<p>like. She said, 'Hasn't Mr. Craven got no governess for</p>\n<p>her, nor no nurse?' and I said, 'No, he hasn't,</p>\n<p>though Mrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of</p>\n<p>it, but she says he mayn't think of it for</p>\n<p>two or three years.'\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want a governess,\" said Mary sharply.</p>",
        "<p>\"But mother says you ought to be learnin' your book</p>\n<p>by this time an' you ought to have a woman</p>\n<p>to look after you, an' she says: 'Now, Martha, you</p>\n<p>just think how you'd feel yourself, in a big place</p>\n<p>like that, wanderin' about all alone, an' no mother. You</p>\n<p>do your best to cheer her up,' she says, an'</p>\n<p>I said I would.\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary gave her a long, steady look.</p>\n<p>\"You do cheer me up,\" she said. \"I like to</p>\n<p>hear you talk.\"</p>\n<p>Presently Martha went out of the room and came back</p>\n<p>with something held in her hands under her apron.</p>\n<p>\"What does tha' think,\" she said, with a cheerful grin.</p>\n<p>\"I've brought thee a present.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"A present!\" exclaimed Mistress Mary. How could a cottage full</p>\n<p>of fourteen hungry people give any one a present!</p>\n<p>\"A man was drivin' across the moor peddlin',\" Martha explained.</p>\n<p>\"An' he stopped his cart at our door. He had</p>\n<p>pots an' pans an' odds an' ends, but mother had</p>\n<p>no money to buy anythin'. Just as he was goin'</p>\n<p>away our 'Lizabeth Ellen called out, 'Mother, he's got skippin'-ropes</p>",
        "<p>with red an' blue handles.' An' mother she calls out</p>\n<p>quite sudden, 'Here, stop, mister! How much are they?' An'</p>\n<p>he says 'Tuppence,' an' mother she began fumblin' in her</p>\n<p>pocket an' she says to me, 'Martha, tha's brought me</p>\n<p>thy wages like a good lass, an' I've got four</p>\n<p>places to put every penny, but I'm just goin' to</p>\n<p>take tuppence out of it to buy that child a</p>",
        "<p>skippin'-rope,' an' she bought one an' here it is.\"</p>\n<p>She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited</p>\n<p>it quite proudly. It was a strong, slender rope with</p>\n<p>a striped red and blue handle at each end, but</p>\n<p>Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before. She gazed</p>\n<p>at it with a mystified expression.</p>\n<p>\"What is it for?\" she asked curiously.</p>",
        "<p>\"For!\" cried out Martha. \"Does tha' mean that they've not</p>\n<p>got skippin'-ropes in India, for all they've got elephants and</p>\n<p>tigers and camels! No wonder most of 'em's black. This</p>\n<p>is what it's for; just watch me.\"</p>\n<p>And she ran into the middle of the room and,</p>\n<p>taking a handle in each hand, began to skip, and</p>\n<p>skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chair to</p>",
        "<p>stare at her, and the queer faces in the old</p>\n<p>portraits seemed to stare at her, too, and wonder what</p>\n<p>on earth this common little cottager had the impudence to</p>\n<p>be doing under their very noses. But Martha did not</p>\n<p>even see them. The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary's</p>\n<p>face delighted her, and she went on skipping and counted</p>\n<p>as she skipped until she had reached a hundred.</p>",
        "<p>\"I could skip longer than that,\" she said when she</p>\n<p>stopped. \"I've skipped as much as five hundred when I</p>\n<p>was twelve, but I wasn't as fat then as I</p>\n<p>am now, an' I was in practice.\"</p>\n<p>Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n<p>\"It looks nice,\" she said. \"Your mother is a kind</p>",
        "<p>woman. Do you think I could ever skip like that?\"</p>\n<p>\"You just try it,\" urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope.</p>\n<p>\"You can't skip a hundred at first, but if you</p>\n<p>practise you'll mount up. That's what mother said. She says,</p>\n<p>'Nothin' will do her more good than skippin' rope. It's</p>\n<p>th' sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her play</p>\n<p>out in th' fresh air skippin' an' it'll stretch her</p>",
        "<p>legs an' arms an' give her some strength in 'em.'\"</p>\n<p>It was plain that there was not a great deal</p>\n<p>of strength in Mistress Mary's arms and legs when she</p>\n<p>first began to skip. She was not very clever at</p>\n<p>it, but she liked it so much that she did</p>\n<p>not want to stop.</p>\n<p>\"Put on tha' things and run an' skip out o'</p>",
        "<p>doors,\" said Martha. \"Mother said I must tell you to</p>\n<p>keep out o' doors as much as you could, even</p>\n<p>when it rains a bit, so as tha' wrap up</p>\n<p>warm.\"</p>\n<p>Mary put on her coat and hat and took her</p>\n<p>skipping-rope over her arm. She opened the door to go</p>\n<p>out, and then suddenly thought of something and turned back</p>",
        "<p>rather slowly.</p>\n<p>\"Martha,\" she said, \"they were your wages. It was your</p>\n<p>twopence really. Thank you.\" She said it stiffly because she</p>\n<p>was not used to thanking people or noticing that they</p>\n<p>did things for her. \"Thank you,\" she said, and held</p>\n<p>out her hand because she did not know what else</p>\n<p>to do.</p>",
        "<p>Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if</p>\n<p>she was not accustomed to this sort of thing either.</p>\n<p>Then she laughed.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! tha' art a queer, old-womanish thing,\" she said. \"If</p>\n<p>tha'd been our 'Lizabeth Ellen tha'd have give me a</p>\n<p>kiss.\"</p>\n<p>Mary looked stiffer than ever.</p>",
        "<p>\"Do you want me to kiss you?\"</p>\n<p>Martha laughed again.</p>\n<p>\"Nay, not me,\" she answered. \"If tha' was different, p'raps</p>\n<p>tha'd want to thysel'. But tha' isn't. Run off outside</p>\n<p>an' play with thy rope.\"</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out</p>\n<p>of the room. Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was</p>",
        "<p>always rather a puzzle to her. At first she had</p>\n<p>disliked her very much, but now she did not.</p>\n<p>The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. She counted and skipped,</p>\n<p>and skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red,</p>\n<p>and she was more interested than she had ever been</p>\n<p>since she was born. The sun was shining and a</p>\n<p>little wind was blowing--not a rough wind, but one which</p>",
        "<p>came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent</p>\n<p>of newly turned earth with it. She skipped round the</p>\n<p>fountain garden, and up one walk and down another. She</p>\n<p>skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff</p>\n<p>digging and talking to his robin, which was hopping about</p>\n<p>him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he</p>\n<p>lifted his head and looked at her with a curious</p>",
        "<p>expression. She had wondered if he would notice her. She</p>\n<p>really wanted him to see her skip.</p>\n<p>\"Well!\" he exclaimed. \"Upon my word! P'raps tha' art a</p>\n<p>young 'un, after all, an' p'raps tha's got child's blood</p>\n<p>in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk. Tha's skipped red</p>\n<p>into thy cheeks as sure as my name's Ben Weatherstaff.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't have believed tha' could do it.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I never skipped before,\" Mary said. \"I'm just beginning. I</p>\n<p>can only go up to twenty.\"</p>\n<p>\"Tha' keep on,\" said Ben. \"Tha' shapes well enough at</p>\n<p>it for a young 'un that's lived with heathen. Just</p>\n<p>see how he's watchin' thee,\" jerking his head toward the</p>\n<p>robin. \"He followed after thee yesterday. He'll be at it</p>\n<p>again to-day. He'll be bound to find out what th'</p>",
        "<p>skippin'-rope is. He's never seen one. Eh!\" shaking his head</p>\n<p>at the bird, \"tha' curosity will be th' death of</p>\n<p>thee sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp.\"</p>\n<p>Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard,</p>\n<p>resting every few minutes. At length she went to her</p>\n<p>own special walk and made up her mind to try</p>\n<p>if she could skip the whole length of it. It</p>",
        "<p>was a good long skip and she began slowly, but</p>\n<p>before she had gone half-way down the path she was</p>\n<p>so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop.</p>\n<p>She did not mind much, because she had already counted</p>\n<p>up to thirty. She stopped with a little laugh of</p>\n<p>pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying</p>\n<p>on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her</p>",
        "<p>and he greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had</p>\n<p>skipped toward him she felt something heavy in her pocket</p>\n<p>strike against her at each jump, and when she saw</p>\n<p>the robin she laughed again.</p>\n<p>\"You showed me where the key was yesterday,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"You ought to show me the door to-day; but I</p>\n<p>don't believe you know!\"</p>",
        "<p>The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on</p>\n<p>to the top of the wall and he opened his</p>\n<p>beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show</p>\n<p>off. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely</p>\n<p>as a robin when he shows off--and they are nearly</p>\n<p>always doing it.</p>\n<p>Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in</p>",
        "<p>her Ayah's stories, and she always said that what happened</p>\n<p>almost at that moment was Magic.</p>\n<p>One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down</p>\n<p>the walk, and it was a stronger one than the</p>\n<p>rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of</p>\n<p>the trees, and it was more than strong enough to</p>\n<p>sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the</p>",
        "<p>wall. Mary had stepped close to the robin, and suddenly</p>\n<p>the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails,</p>\n<p>and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught</p>\n<p>it in her hand. This she did because she had</p>\n<p>seen something under it--a round knob which had been covered</p>\n<p>by the leaves hanging over it. It was the knob</p>\n<p>of a door.</p>",
        "<p>She put her hands under the leaves and began to</p>\n<p>pull and push them aside. Thick as the ivy hung,</p>\n<p>it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though</p>\n<p>some had crept over wood and iron. Mary's heart began</p>\n<p>to thump and her hands to shake a little in</p>\n<p>her delight and excitement. The robin kept singing and twittering</p>\n<p>away and tilting his head on one side, as if</p>",
        "<p>he were as excited as she was. What was this</p>\n<p>under her hands which was square and made of iron</p>\n<p>and which her fingers found a hole in?</p>\n<p>It was the lock of the door which had been</p>\n<p>closed ten years and she put her hand in her</p>\n<p>pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the</p>\n<p>keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It</p>",
        "<p>took two hands to do it, but it did turn.</p>\n<p>And then she took a long breath and looked behind</p>\n<p>her up the long walk to see if any one</p>\n<p>was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did</p>\n<p>come, it seemed, and she took another long breath, because</p>\n<p>she could not help it, and she held back the</p>\n<p>swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which</p>",
        "<p>opened slowly--slowly.</p>\n<p>Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her,</p>\n<p>and stood with her back against it, looking about her</p>\n<p>and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.</p>\n<p>She was standing _inside_ the secret garden.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>\n<p>THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANY ONE EVER LIVED IN</p>\n<p>It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could</p>\n<p>imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered</p>\n<p>with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so</p>\n<p>thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they</p>\n<p>were roses because she had seen a great many roses</p>\n<p>in India. All the ground was covered with grass of</p>",
        "<p>a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of</p>\n<p>bushes which were surely rose-bushes if they were alive. There</p>\n<p>were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their</p>\n<p>branches that they were like little trees. There were other</p>\n<p>trees in the garden, and one of the things which</p>\n<p>made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing</p>\n<p>roses had run all over them and swung down long</p>",
        "<p>tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there</p>\n<p>they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching</p>\n<p>branch and had crept from one tree to another and</p>\n<p>made lovely bridges of themselves. There were neither leaves nor</p>\n<p>roses on them now and Mary did not know whether</p>\n<p>they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or</p>\n<p>brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy</p>",
        "<p>mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown</p>\n<p>grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run</p>\n<p>along the ground. It was this hazy tangle from tree</p>\n<p>to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary</p>\n<p>had thought it must be different from other gardens which</p>\n<p>had not been left all by themselves so long; and</p>\n<p>indeed it was different from any other place she had</p>",
        "<p>ever seen in her life.</p>\n<p>\"How still it is!\" she whispered. \"How still!\"</p>\n<p>Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness.</p>\n<p>The robin, who had flown to his tree-top, was still</p>\n<p>as all the rest. He did not even flutter his</p>\n<p>wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.</p>\n<p>\"No wonder it is still,\" she whispered again. \"I am</p>",
        "<p>the first person who has spoken in here for ten</p>\n<p>years.\"</p>\n<p>She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as</p>\n<p>if she were afraid of awakening some one. She was</p>\n<p>glad that there was grass under her feet and that</p>\n<p>her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of</p>\n<p>the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up</p>",
        "<p>at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.</p>\n<p>\"I wonder if they are all quite dead,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it</p>\n<p>wasn't.\"</p>\n<p>If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told</p>\n<p>whether the wood was alive by looking at it, but</p>\n<p>she could only see that there were only gray or</p>",
        "<p>brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of</p>\n<p>even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere.</p>\n<p>But she was _inside_ the wonderful garden and she could</p>\n<p>come through the door under the ivy any time and</p>\n<p>she felt as if she had found a world all</p>\n<p>her own.</p>\n<p>The sun was shining inside the four walls and the</p>",
        "<p>high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of</p>\n<p>Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was</p>\n<p>over the moor. The robin flew down from his tree-top</p>\n<p>and hopped about or flew after her from one bush</p>\n<p>to another. He chirped a good deal and had a</p>\n<p>very busy air, as if he were showing her things.</p>\n<p>Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be</p>",
        "<p>hundreds of miles away from any one, but somehow she</p>\n<p>did not feel lonely at all. All that troubled her</p>\n<p>was her wish that she knew whether all the roses</p>\n<p>were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived</p>\n<p>and might put out leaves and buds as the weather</p>\n<p>got warmer. She did not want it to be a</p>\n<p>quite dead garden. If it were a quite alive garden,</p>",
        "<p>how wonderful it would be, and what thousands of roses</p>\n<p>would grow on every side!</p>\n<p>Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came</p>\n<p>in and after she had walked about for a while</p>\n<p>she thought she would skip round the whole garden, stopping</p>\n<p>when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to</p>\n<p>have been grass paths here and there, and in one</p>",
        "<p>or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone</p>\n<p>seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them.</p>\n<p>As she came near the second of these alcoves she</p>\n<p>stopped skipping. There had once been a flower-bed in it,</p>\n<p>and she thought she saw something sticking out of the</p>\n<p>black earth--some sharp little pale green points. She remembered what</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look</p>",
        "<p>at them.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, they are tiny growing things and they _might_ be</p>\n<p>crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils,\" she whispered.</p>\n<p>She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh</p>\n<p>scent of the damp earth. She liked it very much.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other</p>\n<p>places,\" she said. \"I will go all over the garden</p>",
        "<p>and look.\"</p>\n<p>She did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and</p>\n<p>kept her eyes on the ground. She looked in the</p>\n<p>old border beds and among the grass, and after she</p>\n<p>had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found</p>\n<p>ever so many more sharp, pale green points, and she</p>\n<p>had become quite excited again.</p>",
        "<p>\"It isn't a quite dead garden,\" she cried out softly</p>\n<p>to herself. \"Even if the roses are dead, there are</p>\n<p>other things alive.\"</p>\n<p>She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass</p>\n<p>seemed so thick in some of the places where the</p>\n<p>green points were pushing their way through that she thought</p>\n<p>they did not seem to have room enough to grow.</p>",
        "<p>She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece</p>\n<p>of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out</p>\n<p>the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear</p>\n<p>places around them.</p>\n<p>\"Now they look as if they could breathe,\" she said,</p>\n<p>after she had finished with the first ones. \"I am</p>\n<p>going to do ever so many more. I'll do all</p>",
        "<p>I can see. If I haven't time to-day I can</p>\n<p>come to-morrow.\"</p>\n<p>She went from place to place, and dug and weeded,</p>\n<p>and enjoyed herself so immensely that she was led on</p>\n<p>from bed to bed and into the grass under the</p>\n<p>trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first</p>\n<p>threw her coat off, and then her hat, and without</p>",
        "<p>knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass</p>\n<p>and the pale green points all the time.</p>\n<p>The robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased</p>\n<p>to see gardening begun on his own estate. He had</p>\n<p>often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff. Where gardening is done all</p>\n<p>sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with</p>\n<p>the soil. Now here was this new kind of creature</p>",
        "<p>who was not half Ben's size and yet had had</p>\n<p>the sense to come into his garden and begin at</p>\n<p>once.</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time</p>\n<p>to go to her midday dinner. In fact, she was</p>\n<p>rather late in remembering, and when she put on her</p>\n<p>coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could</p>",
        "<p>not believe that she had been working two or three</p>\n<p>hours. She had been actually happy all the time; and</p>\n<p>dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were</p>\n<p>to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful</p>\n<p>as they had looked before when the grass and weeds</p>\n<p>had been smothering them.</p>\n<p>\"I shall come back this afternoon,\" she said, looking all</p>",
        "<p>round at her new kingdom, and speaking to the trees</p>\n<p>and the rose-bushes as if they heard her.</p>\n<p>Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the</p>\n<p>slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy.</p>\n<p>She had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and</p>\n<p>ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.</p>\n<p>\"Two pieces o' meat an' two helps o' rice puddin'!\"</p>",
        "<p>she said. \"Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell</p>\n<p>her what th' skippin'-rope's done for thee.\"</p>\n<p>In the course of her digging with her pointed stick</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of</p>\n<p>white root rather like an onion. She had put it</p>\n<p>back in its place and patted the earth carefully down</p>\n<p>on it and just now she wondered if Martha could</p>",
        "<p>tell her what it was.</p>\n<p>\"Martha,\" she said, \"what are those white roots that look</p>\n<p>like onions?\"</p>\n<p>\"They're bulbs,\" answered Martha. \"Lots o' spring flowers grow from</p>\n<p>'em. Th' very little ones are snowdrops an' crocuses an'</p>\n<p>th' big ones are narcissusis an' jonquils an' daffydowndillys. Th'</p>\n<p>biggest of all is lilies an' purple flags. Eh! they</p>",
        "<p>are nice. Dickon's got a whole lot of 'em planted</p>\n<p>in our bit o' garden.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does Dickon know all about them?\" asked Mary, a new</p>\n<p>idea taking possession of her.</p>\n<p>\"Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a</p>\n<p>brick walk. Mother says he just whispers things out o'</p>\n<p>th' ground.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years</p>\n<p>and years if no one helped them?\" inquired Mary anxiously.</p>\n<p>\"They're things as helps themselves,\" said Martha. \"That's why poor</p>\n<p>folk can afford to have 'em. If you don't trouble</p>\n<p>'em, most of 'em'll work away underground for a lifetime</p>\n<p>an' spread out an' have little 'uns. There's a place</p>\n<p>in th' park woods here where there's snowdrops by thousands.</p>",
        "<p>They're the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th' spring comes.</p>\n<p>No one knows when they was first planted.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wish the spring was here now,\" said Mary. \"I</p>\n<p>want to see all the things that grow in England.\"</p>\n<p>She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite</p>\n<p>seat on the hearth-rug.</p>\n<p>\"I wish--I wish I had a little spade,\" she said.</p>",
        "<p>\"Whatever does tha' want a spade for?\" asked Martha, laughing.</p>\n<p>\"Art tha' goin' to take to diggin'? I must tell</p>\n<p>mother that, too.\"</p>\n<p>Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She</p>\n<p>must be careful if she meant to keep her secret</p>\n<p>kingdom. She wasn't doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven</p>\n<p>found out about the open door he would be fearfully</p>",
        "<p>angry and get a new key and lock it up</p>\n<p>forevermore. She really could not bear that.</p>\n<p>\"This is such a big lonely place,\" she said slowly,</p>\n<p>as if she were turning matters over in her mind.</p>\n<p>\"The house is lonely, and the park is lonely, and</p>\n<p>the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up.</p>\n<p>I never did many things in India, but there were</p>",
        "<p>more people to look at--natives and soldiers marching by--and sometimes</p>\n<p>bands playing, and my Ayah told me stories. There is</p>\n<p>no one to talk to here except you and Ben</p>\n<p>Weatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben</p>\n<p>Weatherstaff won't speak to me often. I thought if I</p>\n<p>had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he</p>\n<p>does, and I might make a little garden if he</p>",
        "<p>would give me some seeds.\"</p>\n<p>Martha's face quite lighted up.</p>\n<p>\"There now!\" she exclaimed, \"if that wasn't one of th'</p>\n<p>things mother said. She says, 'There's such a lot o'</p>\n<p>room in that big place, why don't they give her</p>\n<p>a bit for herself, even if she doesn't plant nothin'</p>\n<p>but parsley an' radishes? She'd dig an' rake away an'</p>",
        "<p>be right down happy over it.' Them was the very</p>\n<p>words she said.\"</p>\n<p>\"Were they?\" said Mary. \"How many things she knows, doesn't</p>\n<p>she?\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" said Martha. \"It's like she says: 'A woman as</p>\n<p>brings up twelve children learns something besides her A B</p>\n<p>C. Children's as good as 'rithmetic to set you findin'</p>",
        "<p>out things.'\"</p>\n<p>\"How much would a spade cost--a little one?\" Mary asked.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" was Martha's reflective answer, \"at Thwaite village there's a</p>\n<p>shop or so an' I saw little garden sets with</p>\n<p>a spade an' a rake an' a fork all tied</p>\n<p>together for two shillings. An' they was stout enough to</p>\n<p>work with, too.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I've got more than that in my purse,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave</p>\n<p>me some money from Mr. Craven.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did he remember thee that much?\" exclaimed Martha.</p>\n<p>\"Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a</p>\n<p>week to spend. She gives me one every Saturday. I</p>\n<p>didn't know what to spend it on.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"My word! that's riches,\" said Martha. \"Tha' can buy anything</p>\n<p>in th' world tha' wants. Th' rent of our cottage</p>\n<p>is only one an' threepence an' it's like pullin' eye-teeth</p>\n<p>to get it. Now I've just thought of somethin',\" putting</p>\n<p>her hands on her hips.</p>\n<p>\"What?\" said Mary eagerly.</p>\n<p>\"In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o' flower-seeds</p>",
        "<p>for a penny each, and our Dickon he knows which</p>\n<p>is th' prettiest ones an' how to make 'em grow.</p>\n<p>He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for</p>\n<p>th' fun of it. Does tha' know how to print</p>\n<p>letters?\" suddenly.</p>\n<p>\"I know how to write,\" Mary answered.</p>\n<p>Martha shook her head.</p>",
        "<p>\"Our Dickon can only read printin'. If tha' could print</p>\n<p>we could write a letter to him an' ask him</p>\n<p>to go an' buy th' garden tools an' th' seeds</p>\n<p>at th' same time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! you're a good girl!\" Mary cried. \"You are, really!</p>\n<p>I didn't know you were so nice. I know I</p>\n<p>can print letters if I try. Let's ask Mrs. Medlock</p>",
        "<p>for a pen and ink and some paper.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've got some of my own,\" said Martha. \"I bought</p>\n<p>'em so I could print a bit of a letter</p>\n<p>to mother of a Sunday. I'll go and get it.\"</p>\n<p>She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by</p>\n<p>the fire and twisted her thin little hands together with</p>\n<p>sheer pleasure.</p>",
        "<p>\"If I have a spade,\" she whispered, \"I can make</p>\n<p>the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds. If</p>\n<p>I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden</p>\n<p>won't be dead at all--it will come alive.\"</p>\n<p>She did not go out again that afternoon because when</p>\n<p>Martha returned with her pen and ink and paper she</p>\n<p>was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates</p>",
        "<p>and dishes down-stairs and when she got into the kitchen</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something,</p>\n<p>so Mary waited for what seemed to her a long</p>\n<p>time before she came back. Then it was a serious</p>\n<p>piece of work to write to Dickon. Mary had been</p>\n<p>taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too</p>\n<p>much to stay with her. She could not spell particularly</p>",
        "<p>well but she found that she could print letters when</p>\n<p>she tried. This was the letter Martha dictated to her:</p>\n<p>\"_My Dear Dickon:_</p>\n<p>This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves</p>\n<p>me at present. Miss Mary has plenty of money and</p>\n<p>will you go to Thwaite and buy her some flower</p>\n<p>seeds and a set of garden tools to make a</p>",
        "<p>flower-bed. Pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because</p>\n<p>she has never done it before and lived in India</p>\n<p>which is different. Give my love to mother and every</p>\n<p>one of you. Miss Mary is going to tell me</p>\n<p>a lot more so that on my next day out</p>\n<p>you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen going</p>\n<p>hunting lions and tigers.</p>",
        "<p>\"Your loving sister, \"MARTHA PHOEBE SOWERBY.\"</p>\n<p>\"We'll put the money in th' envelope an' I'll get</p>\n<p>th' butcher's boy to take it in his cart. He's</p>\n<p>a great friend o' Dickon's,\" said Martha.</p>\n<p>\"How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?\"</p>\n<p>asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"He'll bring 'em to you himself. He'll like to walk</p>",
        "<p>over this way.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" exclaimed Mary, \"then I shall see him! I never</p>\n<p>thought I should see Dickon.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does tha' want to see him?\" asked Martha suddenly, she</p>\n<p>had looked so pleased.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I do. I never saw a boy foxes and</p>\n<p>crows loved. I want to see him very much.\"</p>",
        "<p>Martha gave a little start, as if she suddenly remembered</p>\n<p>something.</p>\n<p>\"Now to think,\" she broke out, \"to think o' me</p>\n<p>forgettin' that there; an' I thought I was goin' to</p>\n<p>tell you first thing this mornin'. I asked mother--and she</p>\n<p>said she'd ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you mean--\" Mary began.</p>",
        "<p>\"What I said Tuesday. Ask her if you might be</p>\n<p>driven over to our cottage some day and have a</p>\n<p>bit o' mother's hot oat cake, an' butter, an' a</p>\n<p>glass o' milk.\"</p>\n<p>It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening</p>\n<p>in one day. To think of going over the moor</p>\n<p>in the daylight and when the sky was blue! To</p>",
        "<p>think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!</p>\n<p>\"Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?\" she</p>\n<p>asked, quite anxiously.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, she thinks she would. She knows what a tidy</p>\n<p>woman mother is and how clean she keeps the cottage.\"</p>\n<p>\"If I went I should see your mother as well</p>\n<p>as Dickon,\" said Mary, thinking it over and liking the</p>",
        "<p>idea very much. \"She doesn't seem to be like the</p>\n<p>mothers in India.\"</p>\n<p>Her work in the garden and the excitement of the</p>\n<p>afternoon ended by making her feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha</p>\n<p>stayed with her until tea-time, but they sat in comfortable</p>\n<p>quiet and talked very little. But just before Martha went</p>\n<p>down-stairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.</p>",
        "<p>\"Martha,\" she said, \"has the scullery-maid had the toothache again</p>\n<p>to-day?\"</p>\n<p>Martha certainly started slightly.</p>\n<p>\"What makes thee ask that?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Because when I waited so long for you to come</p>\n<p>back I opened the door and walked down the corridor</p>\n<p>to see if you were coming. And I heard that</p>",
        "<p>far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other</p>\n<p>night. There isn't a wind to-day, so you see it</p>\n<p>couldn't have been the wind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" said Martha restlessly. \"Tha' mustn't go walkin' about in</p>\n<p>corridors an' listenin'. Mr. Craven would be that there angry</p>\n<p>there's no knowin' what he'd do.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't listening,\" said Mary. \"I was just waiting for</p>",
        "<p>you--and I heard it. That's three times.\"</p>\n<p>\"My word! There's Mrs. Medlock's bell,\" said Martha, and she</p>\n<p>almost ran out of the room.</p>\n<p>\"It's the strangest house any one ever lived in,\" said</p>\n<p>Mary drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned</p>\n<p>seat of the armchair near her. Fresh air, and digging,</p>\n<p>and skipping-rope had made her feel so comfortably tired that</p>",
        "<p>she fell asleep.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>\n<p>DICKON</p>\n<p>The sun shone down for nearly a week on the</p>\n<p>secret garden. The Secret Garden was what Mary called it</p>\n<p>when she was thinking of it. She liked the name,</p>\n<p>and she liked still more the feeling that when its</p>\n<p>beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where</p>\n<p>she was. It seemed almost like being shut out of</p>",
        "<p>the world in some fairy place. The few books she</p>\n<p>had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she</p>\n<p>had read of secret gardens in some of the stories.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred</p>\n<p>years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. She</p>\n<p>had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact,</p>\n<p>she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at</p>",
        "<p>Misselthwaite. She was beginning to like to be out of</p>\n<p>doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip</p>\n<p>up to a hundred. The bulbs in the secret garden</p>\n<p>must have been much astonished. Such nice clear places were</p>\n<p>made round them that they had all the breathing space</p>\n<p>they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it,</p>",
        "<p>they began to cheer up under the dark earth and</p>\n<p>work tremendously. The sun could get at them and warm</p>\n<p>them, and when the rain came down it could reach</p>\n<p>them at once, so they began to feel very much</p>\n<p>alive.</p>\n<p>Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she</p>\n<p>had something interesting to be determined about, she was very</p>",
        "<p>much absorbed, indeed. She worked and dug and pulled up</p>\n<p>weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every</p>\n<p>hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to her</p>\n<p>like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more</p>\n<p>of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever</p>\n<p>hoped to find. They seemed to be starting up everywhere</p>\n<p>and each day she was sure she found tiny new</p>",
        "<p>ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the</p>\n<p>earth. There were so many that she remembered what Martha</p>\n<p>had said about the \"snowdrops by the thousands,\" and about</p>\n<p>bulbs spreading and making new ones. These had been left</p>\n<p>to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread,</p>\n<p>like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long it</p>\n<p>would be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes</p>",
        "<p>she stopped digging to look at the garden and try</p>\n<p>to imagine what it would be like when it was</p>\n<p>covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.</p>\n<p>During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to</p>\n<p>start up beside him as if she sprang out of</p>\n<p>the earth. The truth was that she was afraid that</p>",
        "<p>he would pick up his tools and go away if</p>\n<p>he saw her coming, so she always walked toward him</p>\n<p>as silently as possible. But, in fact, he did not</p>\n<p>object to her as strongly as he had at first.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire</p>\n<p>for his elderly company. Then, also, she was more civil</p>\n<p>than she had been. He did not know that when</p>",
        "<p>she first saw him she spoke to him as she</p>\n<p>would have spoken to a native, and had not known</p>\n<p>that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed</p>\n<p>to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by</p>\n<p>them to do things.</p>\n<p>\"Tha'rt like th' robin,\" he said to her one morning</p>\n<p>when he lifted his head and saw her standing by</p>",
        "<p>him. \"I never knows when I shall see thee or</p>\n<p>which side tha'll come from.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's friends with me now,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"That's like him,\" snapped Ben Weatherstaff. \"Makin' up to th'</p>\n<p>women folk just for vanity an' flightiness. There's nothin' he</p>\n<p>wouldn't do for th' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin'</p>\n<p>his tail-feathers. He's as full o' pride as an egg's</p>",
        "<p>full o' meat.\"</p>\n<p>He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even</p>\n<p>answer Mary's questions except by a grunt, but this morning</p>\n<p>he said more than usual. He stood up and rested</p>\n<p>one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while</p>\n<p>he looked her over.</p>\n<p>\"How long has tha' been here?\" he jerked out.</p>",
        "<p>\"I think it's about a month,\" she answered.</p>\n<p>\"Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit,\" he said. \"Tha's a</p>\n<p>bit fatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so</p>\n<p>yeller. Tha' looked like a young plucked crow when tha'</p>\n<p>first came into this garden. Thinks I to myself I</p>\n<p>never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young 'un.\"</p>\n<p>Mary was not vain and as she had never thought</p>",
        "<p>much of her looks she was not greatly disturbed.</p>\n<p>\"I know I'm fatter,\" she said. \"My stockings are getting</p>\n<p>tighter. They used to make wrinkles. There's the robin, Ben</p>\n<p>Weatherstaff.\"</p>\n<p>There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked</p>\n<p>nicer than ever. His red waistcoat was as glossy as</p>\n<p>satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted</p>",
        "<p>his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively</p>\n<p>graces. He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him.</p>\n<p>But Ben was sarcastic.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, there tha' art!\" he said. \"Tha' can put up</p>\n<p>with me for a bit sometimes when tha's got no</p>\n<p>one better. Tha's been reddinin' up thy waistcoat an' polishin'</p>\n<p>thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha's up</p>",
        "<p>to. Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere, tellin' thy</p>\n<p>lies to her about bein' th' finest cock robin on</p>\n<p>Missel Moor an' ready to fight all th' rest of</p>\n<p>'em.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! look at him!\" exclaimed Mary.</p>\n<p>The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He</p>\n<p>hopped closer and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more</p>",
        "<p>and more engagingly. He flew on to the nearest currant</p>\n<p>bush and tilted his head and sang a little song</p>\n<p>right at him.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that,\" said</p>\n<p>Ben, wrinkling his face up in such a way that</p>\n<p>Mary felt sure he was trying not to look pleased.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee--that's what</p>",
        "<p>tha' thinks.\"</p>\n<p>The robin spread his wings--Mary could scarcely believe her eyes.</p>\n<p>He flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's</p>\n<p>spade and alighted on the top of it. Then the</p>\n<p>old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression.</p>\n<p>He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe--as</p>\n<p>if he would not have stirred for the world, lest</p>",
        "<p>his robin should start away. He spoke quite in a</p>\n<p>whisper.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'm danged!\" he said as softly as if he</p>\n<p>were saying something quite different. \"Tha' does know how to</p>\n<p>get at a chap--tha' does! Tha's fair unearthly, tha's so</p>\n<p>knowin'.\"</p>\n<p>And he stood without stirring--almost without drawing his breath--until the</p>",
        "<p>robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away.</p>\n<p>Then he stood looking at the handle of the spade</p>\n<p>as if there might be Magic in it, and then</p>\n<p>he began to dig again and said nothing for several</p>\n<p>minutes.</p>\n<p>But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now</p>\n<p>and then, Mary was not afraid to talk to him.</p>",
        "<p>\"Have you a garden of your own?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"No. I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you had one,\" said Mary, \"what would you plant?\"</p>\n<p>\"Cabbages an' 'taters an' onions.\"</p>\n<p>\"But if you wanted to make a flower garden,\" persisted</p>\n<p>Mary, \"what would you plant?\"</p>\n<p>\"Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things--but mostly roses.\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary's face lighted up.</p>\n<p>\"Do you like roses?\" she said.</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside</p>\n<p>before he answered.</p>\n<p>\"Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a</p>\n<p>young lady I was gardener to. She had a lot</p>\n<p>in a place she was fond of, an' she loved</p>",
        "<p>'em like they was children--or robins. I've seen her bend</p>\n<p>over an' kiss 'em.\" He dragged out another weed and</p>\n<p>scowled at it. \"That were as much as ten year'</p>\n<p>ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where is she now?\" asked Mary, much interested.</p>\n<p>\"Heaven,\" he answered, and drove his spade deep into the</p>\n<p>soil, \"'cording to what parson says.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"What happened to the roses?\" Mary asked again, more interested</p>\n<p>than ever.</p>\n<p>\"They was left to themselves.\"</p>\n<p>Mary was becoming quite excited.</p>\n<p>\"Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they</p>\n<p>are left to themselves?\" she ventured.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'd got to like 'em--an' I liked her--an' she</p>",
        "<p>liked 'em,\" Ben Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly. \"Once or twice a</p>\n<p>year I'd go an' work at 'em a bit--prune 'em</p>\n<p>an' dig about th' roots. They run wild, but they</p>\n<p>was in rich soil, so some of 'em lived.\"</p>\n<p>\"When they have no leaves and look gray and brown</p>\n<p>and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead</p>\n<p>or alive?\" inquired Mary.</p>",
        "<p>\"Wait till th' spring gets at 'em--wait till th' sun</p>\n<p>shines on th' rain an' th' rain falls on th'</p>\n<p>sunshine an' then tha'll find out.\"</p>\n<p>\"How--how?\" cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.</p>\n<p>\"Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' sees</p>\n<p>a bit of a brown lump swelling here an' there,</p>\n<p>watch it after th' warm rain an' see what happens.\"</p>",
        "<p>He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face.</p>\n<p>\"Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such,</p>\n<p>all of a sudden?\" he demanded.</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost</p>\n<p>afraid to answer.</p>\n<p>\"I--I want to play that--that I have a garden of</p>\n<p>my own,\" she stammered. \"I--there is nothing for me to</p>",
        "<p>do. I have nothing--and no one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, \"that's</p>\n<p>true. Tha' hasn't.\"</p>\n<p>He said it in such an odd way that Mary</p>\n<p>wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her.</p>\n<p>She had never felt sorry for herself; she had only</p>\n<p>felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things</p>",
        "<p>so much. But now the world seemed to be changing</p>\n<p>and getting nicer. If no one found out about the</p>\n<p>secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.</p>\n<p>She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer</p>\n<p>and asked him as many questions as she dared. He</p>\n<p>answered every one of them in his queer grunting way</p>\n<p>and he did not seem really cross and did not</p>",
        "<p>pick up his spade and leave her. He said something</p>\n<p>about roses just as she was going away and it</p>\n<p>reminded her of the ones he had said he had</p>\n<p>been fond of.</p>\n<p>\"Do you go and see those other roses now?\" she</p>\n<p>asked.</p>\n<p>\"Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too</p>",
        "<p>stiff in th' joints.\"</p>\n<p>He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite</p>\n<p>suddenly he seemed to get angry with her, though she</p>\n<p>did not see why he should.</p>\n<p>\"Now look here!\" he said sharply. \"Don't tha' ask so</p>\n<p>many questions. Tha'rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've</p>\n<p>ever come across. Get thee gone an' play thee. I've</p>",
        "<p>done talkin' for to-day.\"</p>\n<p>And he said it so crossly that she knew there</p>\n<p>was not the least use in staying another minute. She</p>\n<p>went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him over</p>\n<p>and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here</p>\n<p>was another person whom she liked in spite of his</p>\n<p>crossness. She liked old Ben Weatherstaff. Yes, she did like</p>",
        "<p>him. She always wanted to try to make him talk</p>\n<p>to her. Also she began to believe that he knew</p>\n<p>everything in the world about flowers.</p>\n<p>There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret</p>\n<p>garden and ended at a gate which opened into a</p>\n<p>wood, in the park. She thought she would skip round</p>\n<p>this walk and look into the wood and see if</p>",
        "<p>there were any rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping</p>\n<p>very much and when she reached the little gate she</p>\n<p>opened it and went through because she heard a low,</p>\n<p>peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it</p>\n<p>was.</p>\n<p>It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught</p>\n<p>her breath as she stopped to look at it. A</p>",
        "<p>boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against</p>\n<p>it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a</p>\n<p>funny looking boy about twelve. He looked very clean and</p>\n<p>his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red</p>\n<p>as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round</p>\n<p>and such blue eyes in any boy's face. And on</p>\n<p>the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown</p>",
        "<p>squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a</p>\n<p>bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck</p>\n<p>to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits</p>\n<p>sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared</p>\n<p>as if they were all drawing near to watch him</p>\n<p>and listen to the strange low little call his pipe</p>\n<p>seemed to make.</p>",
        "<p>When he saw Mary he held up his hand and</p>\n<p>spoke to her in a voice almost as low as</p>\n<p>and rather like his piping.</p>\n<p>\"Don't tha' move,\" he said. \"It'd flight 'em.\"</p>\n<p>Mary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began</p>\n<p>to rise from the ground. He moved so slowly that</p>\n<p>it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all,</p>",
        "<p>but at last he stood on his feet and then</p>\n<p>the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his</p>\n<p>tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped</p>\n<p>on all fours and began to hop away, though not</p>\n<p>at all as if they were frightened.</p>\n<p>\"I'm Dickon,\" the boy said. \"I know tha'rt Miss Mary.\"</p>\n<p>Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first</p>",
        "<p>that he was Dickon. Who else could have been charming</p>\n<p>rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India?</p>\n<p>He had a wide, red, curving mouth and his smile</p>\n<p>spread all over his face.</p>\n<p>\"I got up slow,\" he explained, \"because if tha' makes</p>\n<p>a quick move it startles 'em. A body 'as to</p>\n<p>move gentle an' speak low when wild things is about.\"</p>",
        "<p>He did not speak to her as if they had</p>\n<p>never seen each other before but as if he knew</p>\n<p>her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she</p>\n<p>spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather</p>\n<p>shy.</p>\n<p>\"Did you get Martha's letter?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.</p>",
        "<p>\"That's why I come.\"</p>\n<p>He stooped to pick up something which had been lying</p>\n<p>on the ground beside him when he piped.</p>\n<p>\"I've got th' garden tools. There's a little spade an'</p>\n<p>rake an' a fork an' hoe. Eh! they are good</p>\n<p>'uns. There's a trowel, too. An' th' woman in th'</p>\n<p>shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one</p>",
        "<p>o' blue larkspur when I bought th' other seeds.\"</p>\n<p>\"Will you show the seeds to me?\" Mary said.</p>\n<p>She wished she could talk as he did. His speech</p>\n<p>was so quick and easy. It sounded as if he</p>\n<p>liked her and was not the least afraid she would</p>\n<p>not like him, though he was only a common moor</p>\n<p>boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and</p>",
        "<p>a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer to him</p>\n<p>she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of</p>\n<p>heather and grass and leaves about him, almost as if</p>\n<p>he were made of them. She liked it very much</p>\n<p>and when she looked into his funny face with the</p>\n<p>red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she</p>\n<p>had felt shy.</p>",
        "<p>\"Let us sit down on this log and look at</p>\n<p>them,\" she said.</p>\n<p>They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown</p>\n<p>paper package out of his coat pocket. He untied the</p>\n<p>string and inside there were ever so many neater and</p>\n<p>smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each</p>\n<p>one.</p>",
        "<p>\"There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,\" he said. \"Mignonette's</p>\n<p>th' sweetest smellin' thing as grows, an' it'll grow wherever</p>\n<p>you cast it, same as poppies will. Them as'll come</p>\n<p>up an' bloom if you just whistle to 'em, them's</p>\n<p>th' nicest of all.\"</p>\n<p>He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face</p>\n<p>lighting up.</p>",
        "<p>\"Where's that robin as is callin' us?\" he said.</p>\n<p>The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with</p>\n<p>scarlet berries, and Mary thought she knew whose it was.</p>\n<p>\"Is it really calling us?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"Aye,\" said Dickon, as if it was the most natural</p>\n<p>thing in the world, \"he's callin' some one he's friends</p>\n<p>with. That's same as sayin' 'Here I am. Look at</p>",
        "<p>me. I wants a bit of a chat.' There he</p>\n<p>is in the bush. Whose is he?\"</p>\n<p>\"He's Ben Weatherstaff's, but I think he knows me a</p>\n<p>little,\" answered Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, he knows thee,\" said Dickon in his low voice</p>\n<p>again. \"An' he likes thee. He's took thee on. He'll</p>\n<p>tell me all about thee in a minute.\"</p>",
        "<p>He moved quite close to the bush with the slow</p>\n<p>movement Mary had noticed before, and then he made a</p>\n<p>sound almost like the robin's own twitter. The robin listened</p>\n<p>a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as if</p>\n<p>he were replying to a question.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, he's a friend o' yours,\" chuckled Dickon.</p>\n<p>\"Do you think he is?\" cried Mary eagerly. She did</p>",
        "<p>so want to know. \"Do you think he really likes</p>\n<p>me?\"</p>\n<p>\"He wouldn't come near thee if he didn't,\" answered Dickon.</p>\n<p>\"Birds is rare choosers an' a robin can flout a</p>\n<p>body worse than a man. See, he's making up to</p>\n<p>thee now. 'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'.\"</p>\n<p>And it really seemed as if it must be true.</p>",
        "<p>He so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped</p>\n<p>on his bush.</p>\n<p>\"Do you understand everything birds say?\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>Dickon's grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving</p>\n<p>mouth, and he rubbed his rough head.</p>\n<p>\"I think I do, and they think I do,\" he</p>\n<p>said. \"I've lived on th' moor with 'em so long.</p>",
        "<p>I've watched 'em break shell an' come out an' fledge</p>\n<p>an' learn to fly an' begin to sing, till I</p>\n<p>think I'm one of 'em. Sometimes I think p'raps I'm</p>\n<p>a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a</p>\n<p>squirrel, or even a beetle, an' I don't know it.\"</p>\n<p>He laughed and came back to the log and began</p>\n<p>to talk about the flower seeds again. He told her</p>",
        "<p>what they looked like when they were flowers; he told</p>\n<p>her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed</p>\n<p>and water them.</p>\n<p>\"See here,\" he said suddenly, turning round to look at</p>\n<p>her. \"I'll plant them for thee myself. Where is tha'</p>\n<p>garden?\"</p>\n<p>Mary's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on</p>",
        "<p>her lap. She did not know what to say, so</p>\n<p>for a whole minute she said nothing. She had never</p>\n<p>thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as</p>\n<p>if she went red and then pale.</p>\n<p>\"Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?\" Dickon said.</p>\n<p>It was true that she had turned red and then</p>\n<p>pale. Dickon saw her do it, and as she still</p>",
        "<p>said nothing, he began to be puzzled.</p>\n<p>\"Wouldn't they give thee a bit?\" he asked. \"Hasn't tha'</p>\n<p>got any yet?\"</p>\n<p>She held her hands even tighter and turned her eyes</p>\n<p>toward him.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know anything about boys,\" she said slowly. \"Could</p>\n<p>you keep a secret, if I told you one? It's</p>",
        "<p>a great secret. I don't know what I should do</p>\n<p>if any one found it out. I believe I should</p>\n<p>die!\" She said the last sentence quite fiercely.</p>\n<p>Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his</p>\n<p>hand over his rough head again, but he answered quite</p>\n<p>good-humoredly.</p>\n<p>\"I'm keepin' secrets all th' time,\" he said. \"If I</p>",
        "<p>couldn't keep secrets from th' other lads, secrets about foxes'</p>\n<p>cubs, an' birds' nests, an' wild things' holes, there'd be</p>\n<p>naught safe on th' moor. Aye, I can keep secrets.\"</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand</p>\n<p>and clutch his sleeve but she did it.</p>\n<p>\"I've stolen a garden,\" she said very fast. \"It isn't</p>\n<p>mine. It isn't anybody's. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for</p>",
        "<p>it, nobody ever goes into it. Perhaps everything is dead</p>\n<p>in it already; I don't know.\"</p>\n<p>She began to feel hot and as contrary as she</p>\n<p>had ever felt in her life.</p>\n<p>\"I don't care, I don't care! Nobody has any right</p>\n<p>to take it from me when I care about it</p>\n<p>and they don't. They're letting it die, all shut in</p>",
        "<p>by itself,\" she ended passionately, and she threw her arms</p>\n<p>over her face and burst out crying--poor little Mistress Mary.</p>\n<p>Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.</p>\n<p>\"Eh-h-h!\" he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the</p>\n<p>way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy.</p>\n<p>\"I've nothing to do,\" said Mary. \"Nothing belongs to me.</p>\n<p>I found it myself and I got into it myself.</p>",
        "<p>I was only just like the robin, and they wouldn't</p>\n<p>take it from the robin.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where is it?\" asked Dickon in a dropped voice.</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary got up from the log at once. She</p>\n<p>knew she felt contrary again, and obstinate, and she did</p>\n<p>not care at all. She was imperious and Indian, and</p>\n<p>at the same time hot and sorrowful.</p>",
        "<p>\"Come with me and I'll show you,\" she said.</p>\n<p>She led him round the laurel path and to the</p>\n<p>walk where the ivy grew so thickly. Dickon followed her</p>\n<p>with a queer, almost pitying, look on his face. He</p>\n<p>felt as if he were being led to look at</p>\n<p>some strange bird's nest and must move softly. When she</p>\n<p>stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he</p>",
        "<p>started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly</p>\n<p>open and they passed in together, and then Mary stood</p>\n<p>and waved her hand round defiantly.</p>\n<p>\"It's this,\" she said. \"It's a secret garden, and I'm</p>\n<p>the only one in the world who wants it to</p>\n<p>be alive.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and</p>",
        "<p>round again.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" he almost whispered, \"it is a queer, pretty place!</p>\n<p>It's like as if a body was in a dream.\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>\n<p>THE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH</p>\n<p>For two or three minutes he stood looking round him,</p>\n<p>while Mary watched him, and then he began to walk</p>\n<p>about softly, even more lightly than Mary had walked the</p>\n<p>first time she had found herself inside the four walls.</p>\n<p>His eyes seemed to be taking in everything--the gray trees</p>\n<p>with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from</p>",
        "<p>their branches, the tangle on the walls and among the</p>\n<p>grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall</p>\n<p>flower urns standing in them.</p>\n<p>\"I never thought I'd see this place,\" he said at</p>\n<p>last, in a whisper.</p>\n<p>\"Did you know about it?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>She had spoken aloud and he made a sign to</p>",
        "<p>her.</p>\n<p>\"We must talk low,\" he said, \"or some one'll hear</p>\n<p>us an' wonder what's to do in here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! I forgot!\" said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her</p>\n<p>hand quickly against her mouth. \"Did you know about the</p>\n<p>garden?\" she asked again when she had recovered herself.</p>\n<p>Dickon nodded.</p>",
        "<p>\"Martha told me there was one as no one ever</p>\n<p>went inside,\" he answered. \"Us used to wonder what it</p>\n<p>was like.\"</p>\n<p>He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle</p>\n<p>about him, and his round eyes looked queerly happy.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! the nests as'll be here come springtime,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"It'd be th' safest nestin' place in England. No one</p>",
        "<p>never comin' near an' tangles o' trees an' roses to</p>\n<p>build in. I wonder all th' birds on th' moor</p>\n<p>don't build here.\"</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without</p>\n<p>knowing it.</p>\n<p>\"Will there be roses?\" she whispered. \"Can you tell? I</p>\n<p>thought perhaps they were all dead.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Eh! No! Not them--not all of 'em!\" he answered. \"Look</p>\n<p>here!\"</p>\n<p>He stepped over to the nearest tree--an old, old one</p>\n<p>with gray lichen all over its bark, but upholding a</p>\n<p>curtain of tangled sprays and branches. He took a thick</p>\n<p>knife out of his pocket and opened one of its</p>\n<p>blades.</p>",
        "<p>\"There's lots o' dead wood as ought to be cut</p>\n<p>out,\" he said. \"An' there's a lot o' old wood,</p>\n<p>but it made some new last year. This here's a</p>\n<p>new bit,\" and he touched a shoot which looked brownish</p>\n<p>green instead of hard, dry gray.</p>\n<p>Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.</p>\n<p>\"That one?\" she said. \"Is that one quite alive--quite?\"</p>",
        "<p>Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.</p>\n<p>\"It's as wick as you or me,\" he said; and</p>\n<p>Mary remembered that Martha had told her that \"wick\" meant</p>\n<p>\"alive\" or \"lively.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad it's wick!\" she cried out in her whisper.</p>\n<p>\"I want them all to be wick. Let us go</p>\n<p>round the garden and count how many wick ones there</p>",
        "<p>are.\"</p>\n<p>She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager</p>\n<p>as she was. They went from tree to tree and</p>\n<p>from bush to bush. Dickon carried his knife in his</p>\n<p>hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful.</p>\n<p>\"They've run wild,\" he said, \"but th' strongest ones has</p>\n<p>fair thrived on it. The delicatest ones has died out,</p>",
        "<p>but th' others has growed an' growed, an' spread an'</p>\n<p>spread, till they's a wonder. See here!\" and he pulled</p>\n<p>down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. \"A body might think</p>\n<p>this was dead wood, but I don't believe it is--down</p>\n<p>to th' root. I'll cut it low down an' see.\"</p>\n<p>He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch</p>\n<p>through, not far above the earth.</p>",
        "<p>\"There!\" he said exultantly. \"I told thee so. There's green</p>\n<p>in that wood yet. Look at it.\"</p>\n<p>Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing</p>\n<p>with all her might.</p>\n<p>\"When it looks a bit greenish an' juicy like that,</p>\n<p>it's wick,\" he explained. \"When th' inside is dry an'</p>\n<p>breaks easy, like this here piece I've cut off, it's</p>",
        "<p>done for. There's a big root here as all this</p>\n<p>live wood sprung out of, an' if th' old wood's</p>\n<p>cut off an' it's dug round, an' took care of</p>\n<p>there'll be--\" he stopped and lifted his face to look</p>\n<p>up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him--\"there'll be</p>\n<p>a fountain o' roses here this summer.\"</p>\n<p>They went from bush to bush and from tree to</p>",
        "<p>tree. He was very strong and clever with his knife</p>\n<p>and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood</p>\n<p>away, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig</p>\n<p>had still green life in it. In the course of</p>\n<p>half an hour Mary thought she could tell too, and</p>\n<p>when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry</p>\n<p>out joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of</p>",
        "<p>the least shade of moist green. The spade, and hoe,</p>\n<p>and fork were very useful. He showed her how to</p>\n<p>use the fork while he dug about roots with the</p>\n<p>spade and stirred the earth and let the air in.</p>\n<p>They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard</p>\n<p>roses when he caught sight of something which made him</p>\n<p>utter an exclamation of surprise.</p>",
        "<p>\"Why!\" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet</p>\n<p>away. \"Who did that there?\"</p>\n<p>It was one of Mary's own little clearings round the</p>\n<p>pale green points.</p>\n<p>\"I did it,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Why, I thought tha' didn't know nothin' about gardenin',\" he</p>\n<p>exclaimed.</p>",
        "<p>\"I don't,\" she answered, \"but they were so little, and</p>\n<p>the grass was so thick and strong, and they looked</p>\n<p>as if they had no room to breathe. So I</p>\n<p>made a place for them. I don't even know what</p>\n<p>they are.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide</p>\n<p>smile.</p>",
        "<p>\"Tha' was right,\" he said. \"A gardener couldn't have told</p>\n<p>thee better. They'll grow now like Jack's bean-stalk. They're crocuses</p>\n<p>an' snowdrops, an' these here is narcissuses,\" turning to another</p>\n<p>patch, \"an' here's daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.\"</p>\n<p>He ran from one clearing to another.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' has done a lot o' work for such a</p>\n<p>little wench,\" he said, looking her over.</p>",
        "<p>\"I'm growing fatter,\" said Mary, \"and I'm growing stronger. I</p>\n<p>used always to be tired. When I dig I'm not</p>\n<p>tired at all. I like to smell the earth when</p>\n<p>it's turned up.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's rare good for thee,\" he said, nodding his head</p>\n<p>wisely. \"There's naught as nice as th' smell o' good</p>\n<p>clean earth, except th' smell o' fresh growin' things when</p>",
        "<p>th' rain falls on 'em. I get out on th'</p>\n<p>moor many a day when it's rainin' an' I lie</p>\n<p>under a bush an' listen to th' soft swish o'</p>\n<p>drops on th' heather an' I just sniff an' sniff.</p>\n<p>My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit's, mother says.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you never catch cold?\" inquired Mary, gazing at him</p>\n<p>wonderingly. She had never seen such a funny boy, or</p>",
        "<p>such a nice one.</p>\n<p>\"Not me,\" he said, grinning. \"I never ketched cold since</p>\n<p>I was born. I wasn't brought up nesh enough. I've</p>\n<p>chased about th' moor in all weathers same as th'</p>\n<p>rabbits does. Mother says I've sniffed up too much fresh</p>\n<p>air for twelve year' to ever get to sniffin' with</p>\n<p>cold. I'm as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.\"</p>",
        "<p>He was working all the time he was talking and</p>\n<p>Mary was following him and helping him with her fork</p>\n<p>or the trowel.</p>\n<p>\"There's a lot of work to do here!\" he said</p>\n<p>once, looking about quite exultantly.</p>\n<p>\"Will you come again and help me to do it?\"</p>\n<p>Mary begged. \"I'm sure I can help, too. I can</p>",
        "<p>dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell</p>\n<p>me. Oh! do come, Dickon!\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll come every day if tha' wants me, rain or</p>\n<p>shine,\" he answered stoutly. \"It's th' best fun I ever</p>\n<p>had in my life--shut in here an' wakenin' up a</p>\n<p>garden.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you will come,\" said Mary, \"if you will help</p>",
        "<p>me to make it alive I'll--I don't know what I'll</p>\n<p>do,\" she ended helplessly. What could you do for a</p>\n<p>boy like that?</p>\n<p>\"I'll tell thee what tha'll do,\" said Dickon, with his</p>\n<p>happy grin. \"Tha'll get fat an' tha'll get as hungry</p>\n<p>as a young fox an' tha'll learn how to talk</p>\n<p>to th' robin same as I do. Eh! we'll have</p>",
        "<p>a lot o' fun.\"</p>\n<p>He began to walk about, looking up in the trees</p>\n<p>and at the walls and bushes with a thoughtful expression.</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't want to make it look like a gardener's</p>\n<p>garden, all clipped an' spick an' span, would you?\" he</p>\n<p>said. \"It's nicer like this with things runnin' wild, an'</p>\n<p>swingin' an' catchin' hold of each other.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Don't let us make it tidy,\" said Mary anxiously. \"It</p>\n<p>wouldn't seem like a secret garden if it was tidy.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled</p>\n<p>look.</p>\n<p>\"It's a secret garden sure enough,\" he said, \"but seems</p>\n<p>like some one besides th' robin must have been in</p>\n<p>it since it was shut up ten year' ago.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"But the door was locked and the key was buried,\"</p>\n<p>said Mary. \"No one could get in.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's true,\" he answered. \"It's a queer place. Seems to</p>\n<p>me as if there'd been a bit o' prunin' done</p>\n<p>here an' there, later than ten year' ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"But how could it have been done?\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>He was examining a branch of a standard rose and</p>",
        "<p>he shook his head.</p>\n<p>\"Aye! how could it!\" he murmured. \"With th' door locked</p>\n<p>an' th' key buried.\"</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived</p>\n<p>she should never forget that first morning when her garden</p>\n<p>began to grow. Of course, it did seem to begin</p>\n<p>to grow for her that morning. When Dickon began to</p>",
        "<p>clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had</p>\n<p>sung at her when he wanted to tease her.</p>\n<p>\"Are there any flowers that look like bells?\" she inquired.</p>\n<p>\"Lilies o' th' valley does,\" he answered, digging away with</p>\n<p>the trowel, \"an' there's Canterbury bells, an' campanulas.\"</p>\n<p>\"Let us plant some,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"There's lilies o' th' valley here already; I saw 'em.</p>",
        "<p>They'll have growed too close an' we'll have to separate</p>\n<p>'em, but there's plenty. Th' other ones takes two years</p>\n<p>to bloom from seed, but I can bring you some</p>\n<p>bits o' plants from our cottage garden. Why does tha'</p>\n<p>want 'em?\"</p>\n<p>Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and</p>\n<p>sisters in India and of how she had hated them</p>",
        "<p>and of their calling her \"Mistress Mary Quite Contrary.\"</p>\n<p>\"They used to dance round and sing at me. They</p>\n<p>sang--</p>\n<p>'Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow? With</p>\n<p>silver bells, and cockle shells, And marigolds all in a</p>\n<p>row.'</p>\n<p>I just remembered it and it made me wonder if</p>",
        "<p>there were really flowers like silver bells.\"</p>\n<p>She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather</p>\n<p>spiteful dig into the earth.</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't as contrary as they were.\"</p>\n<p>But Dickon laughed.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" he said, and as he crumbled the rich black</p>\n<p>soil she saw he was sniffing up the scent of</p>",
        "<p>it, \"there doesn't seem to be no need for no</p>\n<p>one to be contrary when there's flowers an' such like,</p>\n<p>an' such lots o' friendly wild things runnin' about makin'</p>\n<p>homes for themselves, or buildin' nests an' singin' an' whistlin',</p>\n<p>does there?\"</p>\n<p>Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him</p>\n<p>and stopped frowning.</p>",
        "<p>\"Dickon,\" she said. \"You are as nice as Martha said</p>\n<p>you were. I like you, and you make the fifth</p>\n<p>person. I never thought I should like five people.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when</p>\n<p>she was polishing the grate. He did look funny and</p>\n<p>delightful, Mary thought, with his round blue eyes and red</p>\n<p>cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.</p>",
        "<p>\"Only five folk as tha' likes?\" he said. \"Who is</p>\n<p>th' other four?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your mother and Martha,\" Mary checked them off on her</p>\n<p>fingers, \"and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the</p>\n<p>sound by putting his arm over his mouth.</p>\n<p>\"I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad,\" he said,</p>",
        "<p>\"but I think tha' art th' queerest little lass I</p>\n<p>ever saw.\"</p>\n<p>Then Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and</p>\n<p>asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking</p>\n<p>any one before. And she tried to ask it in</p>\n<p>Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India a</p>\n<p>native was always pleased if you knew his speech.</p>",
        "<p>\"Does tha' like me?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" he answered heartily, \"that I does. I likes thee</p>\n<p>wonderful, an' so does th' robin, I do believe!\"</p>\n<p>\"That's two, then,\" said Mary. \"That's two for me.\"</p>\n<p>And then they began to work harder than ever and</p>\n<p>more joyfully. Mary was startled and sorry when she heard</p>\n<p>the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of</p>",
        "<p>her midday dinner.</p>\n<p>\"I shall have to go,\" she said mournfully. \"And you</p>\n<p>will have to go too, won't you?\"</p>\n<p>Dickon grinned.</p>\n<p>\"My dinner's easy to carry about with me,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Mother always lets me put a bit o' somethin' in</p>\n<p>my pocket.\"</p>",
        "<p>He picked up his coat from the grass and brought</p>\n<p>out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up</p>\n<p>in a quiet clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief. It</p>\n<p>held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of</p>\n<p>something laid between them.</p>\n<p>\"It's oftenest naught but bread,\" he said, \"but I've got</p>\n<p>a fine slice o' fat bacon with it to-day.\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed</p>\n<p>ready to enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\"Run on an' get thy victuals,\" he said. \"I'll be</p>\n<p>done with mine first. I'll get some more work done</p>\n<p>before I start back home.\"</p>\n<p>He sat down with his back against a tree.</p>\n<p>\"I'll call th' robin up,\" he said, \"and give him</p>",
        "<p>th' rind o' th' bacon to peck at. They likes</p>\n<p>a bit o' fat wonderful.\"</p>\n<p>Mary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed</p>\n<p>as if he might be a sort of wood fairy</p>\n<p>who might be gone when she came into the garden</p>\n<p>again. He seemed too good to be true. She went</p>\n<p>slowly half-way to the door in the wall and then</p>",
        "<p>she stopped and went back.</p>\n<p>\"Whatever happens, you--you never would tell?\" she said.</p>\n<p>His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite</p>\n<p>of bread and bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.</p>\n<p>\"If tha' was a missel thrush an' showed me where</p>\n<p>thy nest was, does tha' think I'd tell any one?</p>\n<p>Not me,\" he said. \"Tha' art as safe as a</p>",
        "<p>missel thrush.\"</p>\n<p>And she was quite sure she was.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>\n<p>\"MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH?\"</p>\n<p>Mary ran so fast that she was rather out of</p>\n<p>breath when she reached her room. Her hair was ruffled</p>\n<p>on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink. Her</p>\n<p>dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting</p>\n<p>near it.</p>\n<p>\"Tha's a bit late,\" she said. \"Where has tha' been?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I've seen Dickon!\" said Mary. \"I've seen Dickon!\"</p>\n<p>\"I knew he'd come,\" said Martha exultantly. \"How does tha'</p>\n<p>like him?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think--I think he's beautiful!\" said Mary in a determined</p>\n<p>voice.</p>\n<p>Martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" she said, \"he's th' best lad as ever was</p>",
        "<p>born, but us never thought he was handsome. His nose</p>\n<p>turns up too much.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like it to turn up,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"An' his eyes is so round,\" said Martha, a trifle</p>\n<p>doubtful. \"Though they're a nice color.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like them round,\" said Mary. \"And they are exactly</p>\n<p>the color of the sky over the moor.\"</p>",
        "<p>Martha beamed with satisfaction.</p>\n<p>\"Mother says he made 'em that color with always lookin'</p>\n<p>up at th' birds an' th' clouds. But he has</p>\n<p>got a big mouth, hasn't he, now?\"</p>\n<p>\"I love his big mouth,\" said Mary obstinately. \"I wish</p>\n<p>mine were just like it.\"</p>\n<p>Martha chuckled delightedly.</p>",
        "<p>\"It'd look rare an' funny in thy bit of a</p>\n<p>face,\" she said. \"But I knowed it would be that</p>\n<p>way when tha' saw him. How did tha' like th'</p>\n<p>seeds an' th' garden tools?\"</p>\n<p>\"How did you know he brought them?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! I never thought of him not bringin' 'em. He'd</p>\n<p>be sure to bring 'em if they was in Yorkshire.</p>",
        "<p>He's such a trusty lad.\"</p>\n<p>Mary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult</p>\n<p>questions, but she did not. She was very much interested</p>\n<p>in the seeds and gardening tools, and there was only</p>\n<p>one moment when Mary was frightened. This was when she</p>\n<p>began to ask where the flowers were to be planted.</p>\n<p>\"Who did tha' ask about it?\" she inquired.</p>",
        "<p>\"I haven't asked anybody yet,\" said Mary, hesitating.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I wouldn't ask th' head gardener. He's too grand,</p>\n<p>Mr. Roach is.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've never seen him,\" said Mary. \"I've only seen under-gardeners</p>\n<p>and Ben Weatherstaff.\"</p>\n<p>\"If I was you, I'd ask Ben Weatherstaff,\" advised Martha.</p>\n<p>\"He's not half as bad as he looks, for all</p>",
        "<p>he's so crabbed. Mr. Craven lets him do what he</p>\n<p>likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive,</p>\n<p>an' he used to make her laugh. She liked him.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he'd find you a corner somewhere out o' the</p>\n<p>way.\"</p>\n<p>\"If it was out of the way and no one</p>\n<p>wanted it, no one _could_ mind my having it, could</p>",
        "<p>they?\" Mary said anxiously.</p>\n<p>\"There wouldn't be no reason,\" answered Martha. \"You wouldn't do</p>\n<p>no harm.\"</p>\n<p>Mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and</p>\n<p>when she rose from the table she was going to</p>\n<p>run to her room to put on her hat again,</p>\n<p>but Martha stopped her.</p>",
        "<p>\"I've got somethin' to tell you,\" she said. \"I thought</p>\n<p>I'd let you eat your dinner first. Mr. Craven came</p>\n<p>back this mornin' and I think he wants to see</p>\n<p>you.\"</p>\n<p>Mary turned quite pale.</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" she said. \"Why! Why! He didn't want to see</p>\n<p>me when I came. I heard Pitcher say he didn't.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Well,\" explained Martha, \"Mrs. Medlock says it's because o' mother.</p>\n<p>She was walkin' to Thwaite village an' she met him.</p>\n<p>She'd never spoke to him before, but Mrs. Craven had</p>\n<p>been to our cottage two or three times. He'd forgot,</p>\n<p>but mother hadn't an' she made bold to stop him.</p>\n<p>I don't know what she said to him about you</p>\n<p>but she said somethin' as put him in th' mind</p>",
        "<p>to see you before he goes away again, to-morrow.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" cried Mary, \"is he going away to-morrow? I am</p>\n<p>so glad!\"</p>\n<p>\"He's goin' for a long time. He mayn't come back</p>\n<p>till autumn or winter. He's goin' to travel in foreign</p>\n<p>places. He's always doin' it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! I'm so glad--so glad!\" said Mary thankfully.</p>",
        "<p>If he did not come back until winter, or even</p>\n<p>autumn, there would be time to watch the secret garden</p>\n<p>come alive. Even if he found out then and took</p>\n<p>it away from her she would have had that much</p>\n<p>at least.</p>\n<p>\"When do you think he will want to see--\"</p>\n<p>She did not finish the sentence, because the door opened,</p>",
        "<p>and Mrs. Medlock walked in. She had on her best</p>\n<p>black dress and cap, and her collar was fastened with</p>\n<p>a large brooch with a picture of a man's face</p>\n<p>on it. It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock</p>\n<p>who had died years ago, and she always wore it</p>\n<p>when she was dressed up. She looked nervous and excited.</p>\n<p>\"Your hair's rough,\" she said quickly. \"Go and brush it.</p>",
        "<p>Martha, help her to slip on her best dress. Mr.</p>\n<p>Craven sent me to bring her to him in his</p>\n<p>study.\"</p>\n<p>All the pink left Mary's cheeks. Her heart began to</p>\n<p>thump and she felt herself changing into a stiff, plain,</p>\n<p>silent child again. She did not even answer Mrs. Medlock,</p>\n<p>but turned and walked into her bedroom, followed by Martha.</p>",
        "<p>She said nothing while her dress was changed, and her</p>\n<p>hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock down the corridors, in silence. What was there</p>\n<p>for her to say? She was obliged to go and</p>\n<p>see Mr. Craven and he would not like her, and</p>\n<p>she would not like him. She knew what he would</p>\n<p>think of her.</p>",
        "<p>She was taken to a part of the house she</p>\n<p>had not been into before. At last Mrs. Medlock knocked</p>\n<p>at a door, and when some one said, \"Come in,\"</p>\n<p>they entered the room together. A man was sitting in</p>\n<p>an armchair before the fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>\"This is Miss Mary, sir,\" she said.</p>",
        "<p>\"You can go and leave her here. I will ring</p>\n<p>for you when I want you to take her away,\"</p>\n<p>said Mr. Craven.</p>\n<p>When she went out and closed the door, Mary could</p>\n<p>only stand waiting, a plain little thing, twisting her thin</p>\n<p>hands together. She could see that the man in the</p>\n<p>chair was not so much a hunchback as a man</p>",
        "<p>with high, rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair</p>\n<p>streaked with white. He turned his head over his high</p>\n<p>shoulders and spoke to her.</p>\n<p>\"Come here!\" he said.</p>\n<p>Mary went to him.</p>\n<p>He was not ugly. His face would have been handsome</p>\n<p>if it had not been so miserable. He looked as</p>",
        "<p>if the sight of her worried and fretted him and</p>\n<p>as if he did not know what in the world</p>\n<p>to do with her.</p>\n<p>\"Are you well?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Do they take good care of you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>",
        "<p>He rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.</p>\n<p>\"You are very thin,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I am getting fatter,\" Mary answered in what she knew</p>\n<p>was her stiffest way.</p>\n<p>What an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed</p>\n<p>as if they scarcely saw her, as if they were</p>\n<p>seeing something else, and he could hardly keep his thoughts</p>",
        "<p>upon her.</p>\n<p>\"I forgot you,\" he said. \"How could I remember you?</p>\n<p>I intended to send you a governess or a nurse,</p>\n<p>or some one of that sort, but I forgot.\"</p>\n<p>\"Please,\" began Mary. \"Please--\" and then the lump in her</p>\n<p>throat choked her.</p>\n<p>\"What do you want to say?\" he inquired.</p>",
        "<p>\"I am--I am too big for a nurse,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"And please--please don't make me have a governess yet.\"</p>\n<p>He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.</p>\n<p>\"That was what the Sowerby woman said,\" he muttered absent-mindedly.</p>\n<p>Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage.</p>\n<p>\"Is she--is she Martha's mother?\" she stammered.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I think so,\" he replied.</p>",
        "<p>\"She knows about children,\" said Mary. \"She has twelve. She</p>\n<p>knows.\"</p>\n<p>He seemed to rouse himself.</p>\n<p>\"What do you want to do?\"</p>\n<p>\"I want to play out of doors,\" Mary answered, hoping</p>\n<p>that her voice did not tremble. \"I never liked it</p>\n<p>in India. It makes me hungry here, and I am</p>",
        "<p>getting fatter.\"</p>\n<p>He was watching her.</p>\n<p>\"Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good. Perhaps it</p>\n<p>will,\" he said. \"She thought you had better get stronger</p>\n<p>before you had a governess.\"</p>\n<p>\"It makes me feel strong when I play and the</p>\n<p>wind comes over the moor,\" argued Mary.</p>",
        "<p>\"Where do you play?\" he asked next.</p>\n<p>\"Everywhere,\" gasped Mary. \"Martha's mother sent me a skipping-rope. I</p>\n<p>skip and run--and I look about to see if things</p>\n<p>are beginning to stick up out of the earth. I</p>\n<p>don't do any harm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't look so frightened,\" he said in a worried voice.</p>\n<p>\"You could not do any harm, a child like you!</p>",
        "<p>You may do what you like.\"</p>\n<p>Mary put her hand up to her throat because she</p>\n<p>was afraid he might see the excited lump which she</p>\n<p>felt jump into it. She came a step nearer to</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>\"May I?\" she said tremulously.</p>\n<p>Her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than</p>",
        "<p>ever.</p>\n<p>\"Don't look so frightened,\" he exclaimed. \"Of course you may.</p>\n<p>I am your guardian, though I am a poor one</p>\n<p>for any child. I cannot give you time or attention.</p>\n<p>I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I</p>\n<p>wish you to be happy and comfortable. I don't know</p>\n<p>anything about children, but Mrs. Medlock is to see that</p>",
        "<p>you have all you need. I sent for you to-day</p>\n<p>because Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you. Her</p>\n<p>daughter had talked about you. She thought you needed fresh</p>\n<p>air and freedom and running about.\"</p>\n<p>\"She knows all about children,\" Mary said again in spite</p>\n<p>of herself.</p>\n<p>\"She ought to,\" said Mr. Craven. \"I thought her rather</p>",
        "<p>bold to stop me on the moor, but she said--Mrs.</p>\n<p>Craven had been kind to her.\" It seemed hard for</p>\n<p>him to speak his dead wife's name. \"She is a</p>\n<p>respectable woman. Now I have seen you I think she</p>\n<p>said sensible things. Play out of doors as much as</p>\n<p>you like. It's a big place and you may go</p>\n<p>where you like and amuse yourself as you like. Is</p>",
        "<p>there anything you want?\" as if a sudden thought had</p>\n<p>struck him. \"Do you want toys, books, dolls?\"</p>\n<p>\"Might I,\" quavered Mary, \"might I have a bit of</p>\n<p>earth?\"</p>\n<p>In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the</p>\n<p>words would sound and that they were not the ones</p>\n<p>she had meant to say. Mr. Craven looked quite startled.</p>",
        "<p>\"Earth!\" he repeated. \"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"To plant seeds in--to make things grow--to see them come</p>\n<p>alive,\" Mary faltered.</p>\n<p>He gazed at her a moment and then passed his</p>\n<p>hand quickly over his eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Do you--care about gardens so much,\" he said slowly.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't know about them in India,\" said Mary. \"I</p>",
        "<p>was always ill and tired and it was too hot.</p>\n<p>I sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck</p>\n<p>flowers in them. But here it is different.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across</p>\n<p>the room.</p>\n<p>\"A bit of earth,\" he said to himself, and Mary</p>\n<p>thought that somehow she must have reminded him of something.</p>",
        "<p>When he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes</p>\n<p>looked almost soft and kind.</p>\n<p>\"You can have as much earth as you want,\" he</p>\n<p>said. \"You remind me of some one else who loved</p>\n<p>the earth and things that grow. When you see a</p>\n<p>bit of earth you want,\" with something like a smile,</p>\n<p>\"take it, child, and make it come alive.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"May I take it from anywhere--if it's not wanted?\"</p>\n<p>\"Anywhere,\" he answered. \"There! You must go now, I am</p>\n<p>tired.\" He touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock. \"Good-by.</p>\n<p>I shall be away all summer.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must</p>\n<p>have been waiting in the corridor.</p>\n<p>\"Mrs. Medlock,\" Mr. Craven said to her, \"now I have</p>",
        "<p>seen the child I understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She</p>\n<p>must be less delicate before she begins lessons. Give her</p>\n<p>simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in the garden.</p>\n<p>Don't look after her too much. She needs liberty and</p>\n<p>fresh air and romping about. Mrs. Sowerby is to come</p>\n<p>and see her now and then and she may sometimes</p>\n<p>go to the cottage.\"</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Medlock looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that</p>\n<p>she need not \"look after\" Mary too much. She had</p>\n<p>felt her a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as</p>\n<p>little of her as she dared. In addition to this</p>\n<p>she was fond of Martha's mother.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, sir,\" she said. \"Susan Sowerby and me went</p>\n<p>to school together and she's as sensible and good-hearted a</p>",
        "<p>woman as you'd find in a day's walk. I never</p>\n<p>had any children myself and she's had twelve, and there</p>\n<p>never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary can get</p>\n<p>no harm from them. I'd always take Susan Sowerby's advice</p>\n<p>about children myself. She's what you might call healthy-minded--if you</p>\n<p>understand me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I understand,\" Mr. Craven answered. \"Take Miss Mary away now</p>",
        "<p>and send Pitcher to me.\"</p>\n<p>When Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her</p>\n<p>own corridor Mary flew back to her room. She found</p>\n<p>Martha waiting there. Martha had, in fact, hurried back after</p>\n<p>she had removed the dinner service.</p>\n<p>\"I can have my garden!\" cried Mary. \"I may have</p>\n<p>it where I like! I am not going to have</p>",
        "<p>a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming</p>\n<p>to see me and I may go to your cottage!</p>\n<p>He says a little girl like me could not do</p>\n<p>any harm and I may do what I like--anywhere!\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" said Martha delightedly, \"that was nice of him wasn't</p>\n<p>it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Martha,\" said Mary solemnly, \"he is really a nice man,</p>",
        "<p>only his face is so miserable and his forehead is</p>\n<p>all drawn together.\"</p>\n<p>She ran as quickly as she could to the garden.</p>\n<p>She had been away so much longer than she had</p>\n<p>thought she should and she knew Dickon would have to</p>\n<p>set out early on his five-mile walk. When she slipped</p>\n<p>through the door under the ivy, she saw he was</p>",
        "<p>not working where she had left him. The gardening tools</p>\n<p>were laid together under a tree. She ran to them,</p>\n<p>looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon</p>\n<p>to be seen. He had gone away and the secret</p>\n<p>garden was empty--except for the robin who had just flown</p>\n<p>across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watching</p>\n<p>her.</p>",
        "<p>\"He's gone,\" she said wofully. \"Oh! was he--was he--was he</p>\n<p>only a wood fairy?\"</p>\n<p>Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye.</p>\n<p>It was a piece of paper--in fact, it was a</p>\n<p>piece of the letter she had printed for Martha to</p>\n<p>send to Dickon. It was fastened on the bush with</p>\n<p>a long thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon</p>",
        "<p>had left it there. There were some roughly printed letters</p>\n<p>on it and a sort of picture. At first she</p>\n<p>could not tell what it was. Then she saw it</p>\n<p>was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on</p>\n<p>it. Underneath were the printed letters and they said:</p>\n<p>\"I will cum bak.\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>\n<p>\"I AM COLIN\"</p>\n<p>Mary took the picture back to the house when she</p>\n<p>went to her supper and she showed it to Martha.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" said Martha with great pride. \"I never knew our</p>\n<p>Dickon was as clever as that. That there's a picture</p>\n<p>of a missel thrush on her nest, as large as</p>\n<p>life an' twice as natural.\"</p>",
        "<p>Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be</p>\n<p>a message. He had meant that she might be sure</p>\n<p>he would keep her secret. Her garden was her nest</p>\n<p>and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she</p>\n<p>did like that queer, common boy!</p>\n<p>She hoped he would come back the very next day</p>\n<p>and she fell asleep looking forward to the morning.</p>",
        "<p>But you never know what the weather will do in</p>\n<p>Yorkshire, particularly in the springtime. She was awakened in the</p>\n<p>night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops</p>\n<p>against her window. It was pouring down in torrents and</p>\n<p>the wind was \"wuthering\" round the corners and in the</p>\n<p>chimneys of the huge old house. Mary sat up in</p>\n<p>bed and felt miserable and angry.</p>",
        "<p>\"The rain is as contrary as I ever was,\" she</p>\n<p>said. \"It came because it knew I did not want</p>\n<p>it.\"</p>\n<p>She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her</p>\n<p>face. She did not cry, but she lay and hated</p>\n<p>the sound of the heavily beating rain, she hated the</p>\n<p>wind and its \"wuthering.\" She could not go to sleep</p>",
        "<p>again. The mournful sound kept her awake because she felt</p>\n<p>mournful herself. If she had felt happy it would probably</p>\n<p>have lulled her to sleep. How it \"wuthered\" and how</p>\n<p>the big rain-drops poured down and beat against the pane!</p>\n<p>\"It sounds just like a person lost on the moor</p>\n<p>and wandering on and on crying,\" she said.</p>\n<p>* * * * *</p>",
        "<p>She had been lying awake turning from side to side</p>\n<p>for about an hour, when suddenly something made her sit</p>\n<p>up in bed and turn her head toward the door</p>\n<p>listening. She listened and she listened.</p>\n<p>\"It isn't the wind now,\" she said in a loud</p>\n<p>whisper. \"That isn't the wind. It is different. It is</p>\n<p>that crying I heard before.\"</p>",
        "<p>The door of her room was ajar and the sound</p>\n<p>came down the corridor, a far-off faint sound of fretful</p>\n<p>crying. She listened for a few minutes and each minute</p>\n<p>she became more and more sure. She felt as if</p>\n<p>she must find out what it was. It seemed even</p>\n<p>stranger than the secret garden and the buried key. Perhaps</p>\n<p>the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made</p>",
        "<p>her bold. She put her foot out of bed and</p>\n<p>stood on the floor.</p>\n<p>\"I am going to find out what it is,\" she</p>\n<p>said. \"Everybody is in bed and I don't care about</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock--I don't care!\"</p>\n<p>There was a candle by her bedside and she took</p>\n<p>it up and went softly out of the room. The</p>",
        "<p>corridor looked very long and dark, but she was too</p>\n<p>excited to mind that. She thought she remembered the corners</p>\n<p>she must turn to find the short corridor with the</p>\n<p>door covered with tapestry--the one Mrs. Medlock had come through</p>\n<p>the day she lost herself. The sound had come up</p>\n<p>that passage. So she went on with her dim light,</p>\n<p>almost feeling her way, her heart beating so loud that</p>",
        "<p>she fancied she could hear it. The far-off faint crying</p>\n<p>went on and led her. Sometimes it stopped for a</p>\n<p>moment or so and then began again. Was this the</p>\n<p>right corner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it</p>\n<p>was. Down this passage and then to the left, and</p>\n<p>then up two broad steps, and then to the right</p>\n<p>again. Yes, there was the tapestry door.</p>",
        "<p>She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind</p>\n<p>her, and she stood in the corridor and could hear</p>\n<p>the crying quite plainly, though it was not loud. It</p>\n<p>was on the other side of the wall at her</p>\n<p>left and a few yards farther on there was a</p>\n<p>door. She could see a glimmer of light coming from</p>\n<p>beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and</p>",
        "<p>it was quite a young Someone.</p>\n<p>So she walked to the door and pushed it open,</p>\n<p>and there she was standing in the room!</p>\n<p>It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in</p>\n<p>it. There was a low fire glowing faintly on the</p>\n<p>hearth and a night light burning by the side of</p>\n<p>a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the</p>",
        "<p>bed was lying a boy, crying fretfully.</p>\n<p>Mary wondered if she was in a real place or</p>\n<p>if she had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without</p>\n<p>knowing it.</p>\n<p>The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of</p>\n<p>ivory and he seemed to have eyes too big for</p>\n<p>it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled</p>",
        "<p>over his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin</p>\n<p>face seem smaller. He looked like a boy who had</p>\n<p>been ill, but he was crying more as if he</p>\n<p>were tired and cross than as if he were in</p>\n<p>pain.</p>\n<p>Mary stood near the door with her candle in her</p>\n<p>hand, holding her breath. Then she crept across the room,</p>",
        "<p>and as she drew nearer the light attracted the boy's</p>\n<p>attention and he turned his head on his pillow and</p>\n<p>stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that</p>\n<p>they seemed immense.</p>\n<p>[Illustration: \"'WHO ARE YOU?--ARE YOU A GHOST?'\"--_Page 157_]</p>\n<p>\"Who are you?\" he said at last in a half-frightened</p>\n<p>whisper. \"Are you a ghost?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"No, I am not,\" Mary answered, her own whisper sounding</p>\n<p>half frightened. \"Are you one?\"</p>\n<p>He stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help</p>\n<p>noticing what strange eyes he had. They were agate gray</p>\n<p>and they looked too big for his face because they</p>\n<p>had black lashes all round them.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" he replied after waiting a moment or so. \"I</p>",
        "<p>am Colin.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who is Colin?\" she faltered.</p>\n<p>\"I am Colin Craven. Who are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.\"</p>\n<p>\"He is my father,\" said the boy.</p>\n<p>\"Your father!\" gasped Mary. \"No one ever told me he</p>\n<p>had a boy! Why didn't they?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Come here,\" he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed</p>\n<p>on her with an anxious expression.</p>\n<p>She came close to the bed and he put out</p>\n<p>his hand and touched her.</p>\n<p>\"You are real, aren't you?\" he said. \"I have such</p>\n<p>real dreams very often. You might be one of them.\"</p>\n<p>Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left</p>",
        "<p>her room and she put a piece of it between</p>\n<p>his fingers.</p>\n<p>\"Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,\"</p>\n<p>she said. \"I will pinch you a little if you</p>\n<p>like, to show you how real I am. For a</p>\n<p>minute I thought you might be a dream too.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where did you come from?\" he asked.</p>",
        "<p>\"From my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn't</p>\n<p>go to sleep and I heard some one crying and</p>\n<p>wanted to find out who it was. What were you</p>\n<p>crying for?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because I couldn't go to sleep either and my head</p>\n<p>ached. Tell me your name again.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had</p>",
        "<p>come to live here?\"</p>\n<p>He was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but</p>\n<p>he began to look a little more as if he</p>\n<p>believed in her reality.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" he answered. \"They daren't.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Because I should have been afraid you would see me.</p>",
        "<p>I won't let people see me and talk me over.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.</p>\n<p>\"Because I am like this always, ill and having to</p>\n<p>lie down. My father won't let people talk me over</p>\n<p>either. The servants are not allowed to speak about me.</p>\n<p>If I live I may be a hunchback, but I</p>\n<p>shan't live. My father hates to think I may be</p>",
        "<p>like him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, what a queer house this is!\" Mary said. \"What</p>\n<p>a queer house! Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms</p>\n<p>are locked up and gardens are locked up--and you! Have</p>\n<p>you been locked up?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I stay in this room because I don't want</p>\n<p>to be moved out of it. It tires me too</p>",
        "<p>much.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does your father come and see you?\" Mary ventured.</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn't want to</p>\n<p>see me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" Mary could not help asking again.</p>\n<p>A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy's face.</p>\n<p>\"My mother died when I was born and it makes</p>",
        "<p>him wretched to look at me. He thinks I don't</p>\n<p>know, but I've heard people talking. He almost hates me.\"</p>\n<p>\"He hates the garden, because she died,\" said Mary half</p>\n<p>speaking to herself.</p>\n<p>\"What garden?\" the boy asked.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! just--just a garden she used to like,\" Mary stammered.</p>\n<p>\"Have you been here always?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at</p>\n<p>the seaside, but I won't stay because people stare at</p>\n<p>me. I used to wear an iron thing to keep</p>\n<p>my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London</p>\n<p>to see me and said it was stupid. He told</p>\n<p>them to take it off and keep me out in</p>\n<p>the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I don't</p>",
        "<p>want to go out.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't when first I came here,\" said Mary. \"Why</p>\n<p>do you keep looking at me like that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because of the dreams that are so real,\" he answered</p>\n<p>rather fretfully. \"Sometimes when I open my eyes I don't</p>\n<p>believe I'm awake.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're both awake,\" said Mary. She glanced round the room</p>",
        "<p>with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim firelight.</p>\n<p>\"It looks quite like a dream, and it's the middle</p>\n<p>of the night, and everybody in the house is asleep--everybody</p>\n<p>but us. We are wide awake.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want it to be a dream,\" the boy</p>\n<p>said restlessly.</p>\n<p>Mary thought of something all at once.</p>",
        "<p>\"If you don't like people to see you,\" she began,</p>\n<p>\"do you want me to go away?\"</p>\n<p>He still held the fold of her wrapper and he</p>\n<p>gave it a little pull.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" he said. \"I should be sure you were a</p>\n<p>dream if you went. If you are real, sit down</p>\n<p>on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear</p>",
        "<p>about you.\"</p>\n<p>Mary put down her candle on the table near the</p>\n<p>bed and sat down on the cushioned stool. She did</p>\n<p>not want to go away at all. She wanted to</p>\n<p>stay in the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the</p>\n<p>mysterious boy.</p>\n<p>\"What do you want me to tell you?\" she said.</p>",
        "<p>He wanted to know how long she had been at</p>\n<p>Misselthwaite; he wanted to know which corridor her room was</p>\n<p>on; he wanted to know what she had been doing;</p>\n<p>if she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where</p>\n<p>she had lived before she came to Yorkshire. She answered</p>\n<p>all these questions and many more and he lay back</p>\n<p>on his pillow and listened. He made her tell him</p>",
        "<p>a great deal about India and about her voyage across</p>\n<p>the ocean. She found out that because he had been</p>\n<p>an invalid he had not learned things as other children</p>\n<p>had. One of his nurses had taught him to read</p>\n<p>when he was quite little and he was always reading</p>\n<p>and looking at pictures in splendid books.</p>\n<p>Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake,</p>",
        "<p>he was given all sorts of wonderful things to amuse</p>\n<p>himself with. He never seemed to have been amused, however.</p>\n<p>He could have anything he asked for and was never</p>\n<p>made to do anything he did not like to do.</p>\n<p>\"Every one is obliged to do what pleases me,\" he</p>\n<p>said indifferently. \"It makes me ill to be angry. No</p>\n<p>one believes I shall live to grow up.\"</p>",
        "<p>He said it as if he was so accustomed to</p>\n<p>the idea that it had ceased to matter to him</p>\n<p>at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary's</p>\n<p>voice. As she went on talking he listened in a</p>\n<p>drowsy, interested way. Once or twice she wondered if he</p>\n<p>were not gradually falling into a doze. But at last</p>\n<p>he asked a question which opened up a new subject.</p>",
        "<p>\"How old are you?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"I am ten,\" answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment,</p>\n<p>\"and so are you.\"</p>\n<p>\"How do you know that?\" he demanded in a surprised</p>\n<p>voice.</p>\n<p>\"Because when you were born the garden door was locked</p>\n<p>and the key was buried. And it has been locked</p>",
        "<p>for ten years.\"</p>\n<p>Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his</p>\n<p>elbows.</p>\n<p>\"What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was</p>\n<p>the key buried?\" he exclaimed as if he were suddenly</p>\n<p>very much interested.</p>\n<p>\"It--it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,\" said Mary nervously.</p>",
        "<p>\"He locked the door. No one--no one knew where he</p>\n<p>buried the key.\"</p>\n<p>\"What sort of a garden is it?\" Colin persisted eagerly.</p>\n<p>\"No one has been allowed to go into it for</p>\n<p>ten years,\" was Mary's careful answer.</p>\n<p>But it was too late to be careful. He was</p>\n<p>too much like herself. He too had had nothing to</p>",
        "<p>think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted</p>\n<p>him as it had attracted her. He asked question after</p>\n<p>question. Where was it? Had she never looked for the</p>\n<p>door? Had she never asked the gardeners?</p>\n<p>\"They won't talk about it,\" said Mary. \"I think they</p>\n<p>have been told not to answer questions.\"</p>\n<p>\"I would make them,\" said Colin.</p>",
        "<p>\"Could you?\" Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he</p>\n<p>could make people answer questions, who knew what might happen!</p>\n<p>\"Every one is obliged to please me. I told you</p>\n<p>that,\" he said. \"If I were to live, this place</p>\n<p>would sometime belong to me. They all know that. I</p>\n<p>would make them tell me.\"</p>\n<p>Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled,</p>",
        "<p>but she could see quite plainly that this mysterious boy</p>\n<p>had been. He thought that the whole world belonged to</p>\n<p>him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke</p>\n<p>of not living.</p>\n<p>\"Do you think you won't live?\" she asked, partly because</p>\n<p>she was curious and partly in hope of making him</p>\n<p>forget the garden.</p>",
        "<p>\"I don't suppose I shall,\" he answered as indifferently as</p>\n<p>he had spoken before. \"Ever since I remember anything I</p>\n<p>have heard people say I shan't. At first they thought</p>\n<p>I was too little to understand and now they think</p>\n<p>I don't hear. But I do. My doctor is my</p>\n<p>father's cousin. He is quite poor and if I die</p>\n<p>he will have all Misselthwaite when my father is dead.</p>",
        "<p>I should think he wouldn't want me to live.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you want to live?\" inquired Mary.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. \"But I</p>\n<p>don't want to die. When I feel ill I lie</p>\n<p>here and think about it until I cry and cry.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have heard you crying three times,\" Mary said, \"but</p>\n<p>I did not know who it was. Were you crying</p>",
        "<p>about that?\" She did so want him to forget the</p>\n<p>garden.</p>\n<p>\"I dare say,\" he answered. \"Let us talk about something</p>\n<p>else. Talk about that garden. Don't you want to see</p>\n<p>it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Mary, in quite a low voice.</p>\n<p>\"I do,\" he went on persistently. \"I don't think I</p>",
        "<p>ever really wanted to see anything before, but I want</p>\n<p>to see that garden. I want the key dug up.</p>\n<p>I want the door unlocked. I would let them take</p>\n<p>me there in my chair. That would be getting fresh</p>\n<p>air. I am going to make them open the door.\"</p>\n<p>He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began</p>\n<p>to shine like stars and looked more immense than ever.</p>",
        "<p>\"They have to please me,\" he said. \"I will make</p>\n<p>them take me there and I will let you go,</p>\n<p>too.\"</p>\n<p>Mary's hands clutched each other. Everything would be spoiled--everything! Dickon</p>\n<p>would never come back. She would never again feel like</p>\n<p>a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, don't--don't--don't--don't do that!\" she cried out.</p>",
        "<p>He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" he exclaimed. \"You said you wanted to see it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I do,\" she answered almost with a sob in her</p>\n<p>throat, \"but if you make them open the door and</p>\n<p>take you in like that it will never be a</p>\n<p>secret again.\"</p>\n<p>He leaned still farther forward.</p>",
        "<p>\"A secret,\" he said. \"What do you mean? Tell me.\"</p>\n<p>Mary's words almost tumbled over one another.</p>\n<p>\"You see--you see,\" she panted, \"if no one knows but</p>\n<p>ourselves--if there was a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy--if</p>\n<p>there was--and we could find it; and if we could</p>\n<p>slip through it together and shut it behind us, and</p>\n<p>no one knew any one was inside and we called</p>",
        "<p>it our garden and pretended that--that we were missel thrushes</p>\n<p>and it was our nest, and if we played there</p>\n<p>almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made</p>\n<p>it all come alive--\"</p>\n<p>\"Is it dead?\" he interrupted her.</p>\n<p>\"It soon will be if no one cares for it,\"</p>\n<p>she went on. \"The bulbs will live but the roses--\"</p>",
        "<p>He stopped her again as excited as she was herself.</p>\n<p>\"What are bulbs?\" he put in quickly.</p>\n<p>\"They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working</p>\n<p>in the earth now--pushing up pale green points because the</p>\n<p>spring is coming.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is the spring coming?\" he said. \"What is it like?</p>\n<p>You don't see it in rooms if you are ill.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"It is the sun shining on the rain and the</p>\n<p>rain falling on the sunshine, and things pushing up and</p>\n<p>working under the earth,\" said Mary. \"If the garden was</p>\n<p>a secret and we could get into it we could</p>\n<p>watch the things grow bigger every day, and see how</p>\n<p>many roses are alive. Don't you see? Oh, don't you</p>\n<p>see how much nicer it would be if it was</p>",
        "<p>a secret?\"</p>\n<p>He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with</p>\n<p>an odd expression on his face.</p>\n<p>\"I never had a secret,\" he said, \"except that one</p>\n<p>about not living to grow up. They don't know I</p>\n<p>know that, so it is a sort of secret. But</p>\n<p>I like this kind better.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"If you won't make them take you to the garden,\"</p>\n<p>pleaded Mary, \"perhaps--I feel almost sure I can find out</p>\n<p>how to get in sometime. And then--if the doctor wants</p>\n<p>you to go out in your chair, and if you</p>\n<p>can always do what you want to do, perhaps--perhaps we</p>\n<p>might find some boy who would push you, and we</p>\n<p>could go alone and it would always be a secret</p>",
        "<p>garden.\"</p>\n<p>\"I should--like--that,\" he said very slowly, his eyes looking dreamy.</p>\n<p>\"I should like that. I should not mind fresh air</p>\n<p>in a secret garden.\"</p>\n<p>Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because</p>\n<p>the idea of keeping the secret seemed to please him.</p>\n<p>She felt almost sure that if she kept on talking</p>",
        "<p>and could make him see the garden in his mind</p>\n<p>as she had seen it he would like it so</p>\n<p>much that he could not bear to think that everybody</p>\n<p>might tramp into it when they chose.</p>\n<p>\"I'll tell you what I _think_ it would be like,</p>\n<p>if we could go into it,\" she said. \"It has</p>\n<p>been shut up so long things have grown into a</p>",
        "<p>tangle perhaps.\"</p>\n<p>He lay quite still and listened while she went on</p>\n<p>talking about the roses which _might_ have clambered from tree</p>\n<p>to tree and hung down--about the many birds which _might_</p>\n<p>have built their nests there because it was so safe.</p>\n<p>And then she told him about the robin and Ben</p>\n<p>Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the</p>",
        "<p>robin and it was so easy and safe to talk</p>\n<p>about it that she ceased to feel afraid. The robin</p>\n<p>pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked</p>\n<p>almost beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he</p>\n<p>was even plainer than herself, with his big eyes and</p>\n<p>heavy locks of hair.</p>\n<p>\"I did not know birds could be like that,\" he</p>",
        "<p>said. \"But if you stay in a room you never</p>\n<p>see things. What a lot of things you know. I</p>\n<p>feel as if you had been inside that garden.\"</p>\n<p>She did not know what to say, so she did</p>\n<p>not say anything. He evidently did not expect an answer</p>\n<p>and the next moment he gave her a surprise.</p>\n<p>\"I am going to let you look at something,\" he</p>",
        "<p>said. \"Do you see that rose-colored silk curtain hanging on</p>\n<p>the wall over the mantel-piece?\"</p>\n<p>Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up</p>\n<p>and saw it. It was a curtain of soft silk</p>\n<p>hanging over what seemed to be some picture.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" she answered.</p>\n<p>\"There is a cord hanging from it,\" said Colin. \"Go</p>",
        "<p>and pull it.\"</p>\n<p>Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When</p>\n<p>she pulled it the silk curtain ran back on rings</p>\n<p>and when it ran back it uncovered a picture. It</p>\n<p>was the picture of a girl with a laughing face.</p>\n<p>She had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon</p>\n<p>and her gay, lovely eyes were exactly like Colin's unhappy</p>",
        "<p>ones, agate gray and looking twice as big as they</p>\n<p>really were because of the black lashes all round them.</p>\n<p>\"She is my mother,\" said Colin complainingly. \"I don't see</p>\n<p>why she died. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.\"</p>\n<p>\"How queer!\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"If she had lived I believe I should not have</p>\n<p>been ill always,\" he grumbled. \"I dare say I should</p>",
        "<p>have lived, too. And my father would not have hated</p>\n<p>to look at me. I dare say I should have</p>\n<p>had a strong back. Draw the curtain again.\"</p>\n<p>Mary did as she was told and returned to her</p>\n<p>footstool.</p>\n<p>\"She is much prettier than you,\" she said, \"but her</p>\n<p>eyes are just like yours--at least they are the same</p>",
        "<p>shape and color. Why is the curtain drawn over her?\"</p>\n<p>He moved uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>\"I made them do it,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't</p>\n<p>like to see her looking at me. She smiles too</p>\n<p>much when I am ill and miserable. Besides, she is</p>\n<p>mine and I don't want every one to see her.\"</p>\n<p>There were a few moments of silence and then Mary</p>",
        "<p>spoke.</p>\n<p>\"What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that</p>\n<p>I had been here?\" she inquired.</p>\n<p>\"She would do as I told her to do,\" he</p>\n<p>answered. \"And I should tell her that I wanted you</p>\n<p>to come here and talk to me every day. I</p>\n<p>am glad you came.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"So am I,\" said Mary. \"I will come as often</p>\n<p>as I can, but\"--she hesitated--\"I shall have to look every</p>\n<p>day for the garden door.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, you must,\" said Colin, \"and you can tell me</p>\n<p>about it afterward.\"</p>\n<p>He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done</p>\n<p>before, and then he spoke again.</p>",
        "<p>\"I think you shall be a secret, too,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I will not tell them until they find out. I</p>\n<p>can always send the nurse out of the room and</p>\n<p>say that I want to be by myself. Do you</p>\n<p>know Martha?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I know her very well,\" said Mary. \"She waits</p>\n<p>on me.\"</p>",
        "<p>He nodded his head toward the outer corridor.</p>\n<p>\"She is the one who is asleep in the other</p>\n<p>room. The nurse went away yesterday to stay all night</p>\n<p>with her sister and she always makes Martha attend to</p>\n<p>me when she wants to go out. Martha shall tell</p>\n<p>you when to come here.\"</p>\n<p>Then Mary understood Martha's troubled look when she had asked</p>",
        "<p>questions about the crying.</p>\n<p>\"Martha knew about you all the time?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Yes; she often attends to me. The nurse likes to</p>\n<p>get away from me and then Martha comes.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have been here a long time,\" said Mary. \"Shall</p>\n<p>I go away now? Your eyes look sleepy.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wish I could go to sleep before you leave</p>",
        "<p>me,\" he said rather shyly.</p>\n<p>\"Shut your eyes,\" said Mary, drawing her footstool closer, \"and</p>\n<p>I will do what my Ayah used to do in</p>\n<p>India. I will pat your hand and stroke it and</p>\n<p>sing something quite low.\"</p>\n<p>\"I should like that perhaps,\" he said drowsily.</p>\n<p>Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want</p>",
        "<p>him to lie awake, so she leaned against the bed</p>\n<p>and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing</p>\n<p>a very low little chanting song in Hindustani.</p>\n<p>\"That is nice,\" he said more drowsily still, and she</p>\n<p>went on chanting and stroking, but when she looked at</p>\n<p>him again his black lashes were lying close against his</p>\n<p>cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fast</p>",
        "<p>asleep. So she got up softly, took her candle and</p>\n<p>crept away without making a sound.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>\n<p>A YOUNG RAJAH</p>\n<p>The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came</p>\n<p>and the rain had not stopped pouring down. There could</p>\n<p>be no going out of doors. Martha was so busy</p>\n<p>that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but</p>\n<p>in the afternoon she asked her to come and sit</p>\n<p>with her in the nursery. She came bringing the stocking</p>",
        "<p>she was always knitting when she was doing nothing else.</p>\n<p>\"What's the matter with thee?\" she asked as soon as</p>\n<p>they sat down. \"Tha' looks as if tha'd somethin' to</p>\n<p>say.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have. I have found out what the crying was,\"</p>\n<p>said Mary.</p>\n<p>Martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed</p>",
        "<p>at her with startled eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' hasn't!\" she exclaimed. \"Never!\"</p>\n<p>\"I heard it in the night,\" Mary went on. \"And</p>\n<p>I got up and went to see where it came</p>\n<p>from. It was Colin. I found him.\"</p>\n<p>Martha's face became red with fright.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! Miss Mary!\" she said half crying. \"Tha' shouldn't have</p>",
        "<p>done it--tha' shouldn't! Tha'll get me in trouble. I never</p>\n<p>told thee nothin' about him--but tha'll get me in trouble.</p>\n<p>I shall lose my place and what'll mother do!\"</p>\n<p>\"You won't lose your place,\" said Mary. \"He was glad</p>\n<p>I came. We talked and talked and he said he</p>\n<p>was glad I came.\"</p>\n<p>\"Was he?\" cried Martha. \"Art tha' sure? Tha' doesn't know</p>",
        "<p>what he's like when anything vexes him. He's a big</p>\n<p>lad to cry like a baby, but when he's in</p>\n<p>a passion he'll fair scream just to frighten us. He</p>\n<p>knows us daren't call our souls our own.\"</p>\n<p>\"He wasn't vexed,\" said Mary. \"I asked him if I</p>\n<p>should go away and he made me stay. He asked</p>\n<p>me questions and I sat on a big footstool and</p>",
        "<p>talked to him about India and about the robin and</p>\n<p>gardens. He wouldn't let me go. He let me see</p>\n<p>his mother's picture. Before I left him I sang him</p>\n<p>to sleep.\"</p>\n<p>Martha fairly gasped with amazement.</p>\n<p>\"I can scarcely believe thee!\" she protested. \"It's as if</p>\n<p>tha'd walked straight into a lion's den. If he'd been</p>",
        "<p>like he is most times he'd have throwed himself into</p>\n<p>one of his tantrums and roused th' house. He won't</p>\n<p>let strangers look at him.\"</p>\n<p>\"He let me look at him. I looked at him</p>\n<p>all the time and he looked at me. We stared!\"</p>\n<p>said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what to do!\" cried agitated Martha. \"If</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Medlock finds out, she'll think I broke orders and</p>\n<p>told thee and I shall be packed back to mother.\"</p>\n<p>\"He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about</p>\n<p>it yet. It's to be a sort of secret just</p>\n<p>at first,\" said Mary firmly. \"And he says everybody is</p>\n<p>obliged to do as he pleases.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that's true enough--th' bad lad!\" sighed Martha, wiping her</p>",
        "<p>forehead with her apron.</p>\n<p>\"He says Mrs. Medlock must. And he wants me to</p>\n<p>come and talk to him every day. And you are</p>\n<p>to tell me when he wants me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Me!\" said Martha; \"I shall lose my place--I shall for</p>\n<p>sure!\"</p>\n<p>\"You can't if you are doing what he wants you</p>",
        "<p>to do and everybody is ordered to obey him,\" Mary</p>\n<p>argued.</p>\n<p>\"Does tha' mean to say,\" cried Martha with wide open</p>\n<p>eyes, \"that he was nice to thee!\"</p>\n<p>\"I think he almost liked me,\" Mary answered.</p>\n<p>\"Then tha' must have bewitched him!\" decided Martha, drawing a</p>\n<p>long breath.</p>",
        "<p>\"Do you mean Magic?\" inquired Mary. \"I've heard about Magic</p>\n<p>in India, but I can't make it. I just went</p>\n<p>into his room and I was so surprised to see</p>\n<p>him I stood and stared. And then he turned round</p>\n<p>and stared at me. And he thought I was a</p>\n<p>ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he was.</p>\n<p>And it was so queer being there alone together in</p>",
        "<p>the middle of the night and not knowing about each</p>\n<p>other. And we began to ask each other questions. And</p>\n<p>when I asked him if I must go away he</p>\n<p>said I must not.\"</p>\n<p>\"Th' world's comin' to a end!\" gasped Martha.</p>\n<p>\"What is the matter with him?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Nobody knows for sure and certain,\" said Martha. \"Mr. Craven</p>",
        "<p>went off his head like when he was born. Th'</p>\n<p>doctors thought he'd have to be put in a 'sylum.</p>\n<p>It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you.</p>\n<p>He wouldn't set eyes on th' baby. He just raved</p>\n<p>and said it'd be another hunchback like him and it'd</p>\n<p>better die.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is Colin a hunchback?\" Mary asked. \"He didn't look like</p>",
        "<p>one.\"</p>\n<p>\"He isn't yet,\" said Martha. \"But he began all wrong.</p>\n<p>Mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in</p>\n<p>th' house to set any child wrong. They was afraid</p>\n<p>his back was weak an' they've always been takin' care</p>\n<p>of it--keepin' him lyin' down and not lettin' him walk.</p>\n<p>Once they made him wear a brace but he fretted</p>",
        "<p>so he was downright ill. Then a big doctor came</p>\n<p>to see him an' made them take it off. He</p>\n<p>talked to th' other doctor quite rough--in a polite way.</p>\n<p>He said there'd been too much medicine and too much</p>\n<p>lettin' him have his own way.\"</p>\n<p>\"I think he's a very spoiled boy,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"He's th' worst young nowt as ever was!\" said Martha.</p>",
        "<p>\"I won't say as he hasn't been ill a good</p>\n<p>bit. He's had coughs an' colds that's nearly killed him</p>\n<p>two or three times. Once he had rheumatic fever an'</p>\n<p>once he had typhoid. Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a</p>\n<p>fright then. He'd been out of his head an' she</p>\n<p>was talkin' to th' nurse, thinkin' he didn't know nothin',</p>\n<p>an' she said, 'He'll die this time sure enough, an'</p>",
        "<p>best thing for him an' for everybody.' An' she looked</p>\n<p>at him an' there he was with his big eyes</p>\n<p>open, starin' at her as sensible as she was herself.</p>\n<p>She didn't know what'd happen but he just stared at</p>\n<p>her an' says, 'You give me some water an' stop</p>\n<p>talkin'.'\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think he will die?\" asked Mary.</p>",
        "<p>\"Mother says there's no reason why any child should live</p>\n<p>that gets no fresh air an' doesn't do nothin' but</p>\n<p>lie on his back an' read picture-books an' take medicine.</p>\n<p>He's weak and hates th' trouble o' bein' taken out</p>\n<p>o' doors, an' he gets cold so easy he says</p>\n<p>it makes him ill.\"</p>\n<p>Mary sat and looked at the fire.</p>",
        "<p>\"I wonder,\" she said slowly, \"if it would not do</p>\n<p>him good to go out into a garden and watch</p>\n<p>things growing. It did me good.\"</p>\n<p>\"One of th' worst fits he ever had,\" said Martha,</p>\n<p>\"was one time they took him out where the roses</p>\n<p>is by the fountain. He'd been readin' in a paper</p>\n<p>about people gettin' somethin' he called 'rose cold' an' he</p>",
        "<p>began to sneeze an' said he'd got it an' then</p>\n<p>a new gardener as didn't know th' rules passed by</p>\n<p>an' looked at him curious. He threw himself into a</p>\n<p>passion an' he said he'd looked at him because he</p>\n<p>was going to be a hunchback. He cried himself into</p>\n<p>a fever an' was ill all night.\"</p>\n<p>\"If he ever gets angry at me, I'll never go</p>",
        "<p>and see him again,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"He'll have thee if he wants thee,\" said Martha. \"Tha'</p>\n<p>may as well know that at th' start.\"</p>\n<p>Very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up</p>\n<p>her knitting.</p>\n<p>\"I dare say th' nurse wants me to stay with</p>\n<p>him a bit,\" she said. \"I hope he's in a</p>",
        "<p>good temper.\"</p>\n<p>She was out of the room about ten minutes and</p>\n<p>then she came back with a puzzled expression.</p>\n<p>\"Well, tha' has bewitched him,\" she said. \"He's up on</p>\n<p>his sofa with his picture-books. He's told the nurse to</p>\n<p>stay away until six o'clock. I'm to wait in the</p>\n<p>next room. Th' minute she was gone he called me</p>",
        "<p>to him an' says, 'I want Mary Lennox to come</p>\n<p>and talk to me, and remember you're not to tell</p>\n<p>any one.' You'd better go as quick as you can.\"</p>\n<p>Mary was quite willing to go quickly. She did not</p>\n<p>want to see Colin as much as she wanted to</p>\n<p>see Dickon, but she wanted to see him very much.</p>\n<p>There was a bright fire on the hearth when she</p>",
        "<p>entered his room, and in the daylight she saw it</p>\n<p>was a very beautiful room indeed. There were rich colors</p>\n<p>in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on</p>\n<p>the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even</p>\n<p>in spite of the gray sky and falling rain. Colin</p>\n<p>looked rather like a picture himself. He was wrapped in</p>\n<p>a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion.</p>",
        "<p>He had a red spot on each cheek.</p>\n<p>\"Come in,\" he said. \"I've been thinking about you all</p>\n<p>morning.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've been thinking about you, too,\" answered Mary. \"You don't</p>\n<p>know how frightened Martha is. She says Mrs. Medlock will</p>\n<p>think she told me about you and then she will</p>\n<p>be sent away.\"</p>",
        "<p>He frowned.</p>\n<p>\"Go and tell her to come here,\" he said. \"She</p>\n<p>is in the next room.\"</p>\n<p>Mary went and brought her back. Poor Martha was shaking</p>\n<p>in her shoes. Colin was still frowning.</p>\n<p>\"Have you to do what I please or have you</p>\n<p>not?\" he demanded.</p>",
        "<p>\"I have to do what you please, sir,\" Martha faltered,</p>\n<p>turning quite red.</p>\n<p>\"Has Medlock to do what I please?\"</p>\n<p>\"Everybody has, sir,\" said Martha.</p>\n<p>\"Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary</p>\n<p>to me, how can Medlock send you away if she</p>\n<p>finds it out?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Please don't let her, sir,\" pleaded Martha.</p>\n<p>\"I'll send _her_ away if she dares to say a</p>\n<p>word about such a thing,\" said Master Craven grandly. \"She</p>\n<p>wouldn't like that, I can tell you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, sir,\" bobbing a curtsy, \"I want to do</p>\n<p>my duty, sir.\"</p>\n<p>\"What I want is your duty,\" said Colin more grandly</p>",
        "<p>still. \"I'll take care of you. Now go away.\"</p>\n<p>When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary</p>\n<p>gazing at him as if he had set her wondering.</p>\n<p>\"Why do you look at me like that?\" he asked</p>\n<p>her. \"What are you thinking about?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am thinking about two things.\"</p>\n<p>\"What are they? Sit down and tell me.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"This is the first one,\" said Mary, seating herself on</p>\n<p>the big stool. \"Once in India I saw a boy</p>\n<p>who was a Rajah. He had rubies and emeralds and</p>\n<p>diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people</p>\n<p>just as you spoke to Martha. Everybody had to do</p>\n<p>everything he told them--in a minute. I think they would</p>\n<p>have been killed if they hadn't.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,\" he</p>\n<p>said, \"but first tell me what the second thing was.\"</p>\n<p>\"I was thinking,\" said Mary, \"how different you are from</p>\n<p>Dickon.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who is Dickon?\" he said. \"What a queer name!\"</p>\n<p>She might as well tell him, she thought. She could</p>\n<p>talk about Dickon without mentioning the secret garden. She had</p>",
        "<p>liked to hear Martha talk about him. Besides, she longed</p>\n<p>to talk about him. It would seem to bring him</p>\n<p>nearer.</p>\n<p>\"He is Martha's brother. He is twelve years old,\" she</p>\n<p>explained. \"He is not like any one else in the</p>\n<p>world. He can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just</p>\n<p>as the natives in India charm snakes. He plays a</p>",
        "<p>very soft tune on a pipe and they come and</p>\n<p>listen.\"</p>\n<p>There were some big books on a table at his</p>\n<p>side and he dragged one suddenly toward him.</p>\n<p>\"There is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,\" he</p>\n<p>exclaimed. \"Come and look at it.\"</p>\n<p>The book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations</p>",
        "<p>and he turned to one of them.</p>\n<p>\"Can he do that?\" he asked eagerly.</p>\n<p>\"He played on his pipe and they listened,\" Mary explained.</p>\n<p>\"But he doesn't call it Magic. He says it's because</p>\n<p>he lives on the moor so much and he knows</p>\n<p>their ways. He says he feels sometimes as if he</p>\n<p>was a bird or a rabbit himself, he likes them</p>",
        "<p>so. I think he asked the robin questions. It seemed</p>\n<p>as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.\"</p>\n<p>Colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew</p>\n<p>larger and larger and the spots on his cheeks burned.</p>\n<p>\"Tell me some more about him,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"He knows all about eggs and nests,\" Mary went on.</p>\n<p>\"And he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live.</p>",
        "<p>He keeps them secret so that other boys won't find</p>\n<p>their holes and frighten them. He knows about everything that</p>\n<p>grows or lives on the moor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does he like the moor?\" said Colin. \"How can he</p>\n<p>when it's such a great, bare, dreary place?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's the most beautiful place,\" protested Mary. \"Thousands of lovely</p>\n<p>things grow on it and there are thousands of little</p>",
        "<p>creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows</p>\n<p>and chippering or singing or squeaking to each other. They</p>\n<p>are so busy and having such fun under the earth</p>\n<p>or in the trees or heather. It's their world.\"</p>\n<p>\"How do you know all that?\" said Colin, turning on</p>\n<p>his elbow to look at her.</p>\n<p>\"I have never been there once, really,\" said Mary suddenly</p>",
        "<p>remembering. \"I only drove over it in the dark. I</p>\n<p>thought it was hideous. Martha told me about it first</p>\n<p>and then Dickon. When Dickon talks about it you feel</p>\n<p>as if you saw things and heard them and as</p>\n<p>if you were standing in the heather with the sun</p>\n<p>shining and the gorse smelling like honey--and all full of</p>\n<p>bees and butterflies.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"You never see anything if you are ill,\" said Colin</p>\n<p>restlessly. He looked like a person listening to a new</p>\n<p>sound in the distance and wondering what it was.</p>\n<p>\"You can't if you stay in a room,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't go on the moor,\" he said in a</p>\n<p>resentful tone.</p>\n<p>Mary was silent for a minute and then she said</p>",
        "<p>something bold.</p>\n<p>\"You might--sometime.\"</p>\n<p>He moved as if he were startled.</p>\n<p>\"Go on the moor! How could I? I am going</p>\n<p>to die.\"</p>\n<p>\"How do you know?\" said Mary unsympathetically. She didn't like</p>\n<p>the way he had of talking about dying. She did</p>",
        "<p>not feel very sympathetic. She felt rather as if he</p>\n<p>almost boasted about it.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I've heard it ever since I remember,\" he answered</p>\n<p>crossly. \"They are always whispering about it and thinking I</p>\n<p>don't notice. They wish I would, too.\"</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary felt quite contrary. She pinched her lips together.</p>\n<p>\"If they wished I would,\" she said, \"I wouldn't. Who</p>",
        "<p>wishes you would?\"</p>\n<p>\"The servants--and of course Dr. Craven because he would get</p>\n<p>Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor. He daren't say</p>\n<p>so, but he always looks cheerful when I am worse.</p>\n<p>When I had typhoid fever his face got quite fat.</p>\n<p>I think my father wishes it, too.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't believe he does,\" said Mary quite obstinately.</p>",
        "<p>That made Colin turn and look at her again.</p>\n<p>\"Don't you?\" he said.</p>\n<p>And then he lay back on his cushion and was</p>\n<p>still, as if he were thinking. And there was quite</p>\n<p>a long silence. Perhaps they were both of them thinking</p>\n<p>strange things children do not usually think of.</p>\n<p>\"I like the grand doctor from London, because he made</p>",
        "<p>them take the iron thing off,\" said Mary at last.</p>\n<p>\"Did he say you were going to die?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>\"What did he say?\"</p>\n<p>\"He didn't whisper,\" Colin answered. \"Perhaps he knew I hated</p>\n<p>whispering. I heard him say one thing quite aloud. He</p>\n<p>said, 'The lad might live if he would make up</p>",
        "<p>his mind to it. Put him in the humor.' It</p>\n<p>sounded as if he was in a temper.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll tell you who would put you in the humor,</p>\n<p>perhaps,\" said Mary reflecting. She felt as if she would</p>\n<p>like this thing to be settled one way or the</p>\n<p>other. \"I believe Dickon would. He's always talking about live</p>\n<p>things. He never talks about dead things or things that</p>",
        "<p>are ill. He's always looking up in the sky to</p>\n<p>watch birds flying--or looking down at the earth to see</p>\n<p>something growing. He has such round blue eyes and they</p>\n<p>are so wide open with looking about. And he laughs</p>\n<p>such a big laugh with his wide mouth--and his cheeks</p>\n<p>are as red--as red as cherries.\"</p>\n<p>She pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her</p>",
        "<p>expression quite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving</p>\n<p>mouth and wide open eyes.</p>\n<p>\"See here,\" she said. \"Don't let us talk about dying;</p>\n<p>I don't like it. Let us talk about living. Let</p>\n<p>us talk and talk about Dickon. And then we will</p>\n<p>look at your pictures.\"</p>\n<p>It was the best thing she could have said. To</p>",
        "<p>talk about Dickon meant to talk about the moor and</p>\n<p>about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in</p>\n<p>it on sixteen shillings a week--and the children who got</p>\n<p>fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies. And</p>\n<p>about Dickon's mother--and the skipping-rope--and the moor with the sun</p>\n<p>on it--and about pale green points sticking up out of</p>\n<p>the black sod. And it was all so alive that</p>",
        "<p>Mary talked more than she had ever talked before--and Colin</p>\n<p>both talked and listened as he had never done either</p>\n<p>before. And they both began to laugh over nothings as</p>\n<p>children will when they are happy together. And they laughed</p>\n<p>so that in the end they were making as much</p>\n<p>noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural</p>\n<p>ten-year-old creatures--instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a</p>",
        "<p>sickly boy who believed that he was going to die.</p>\n<p>They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures</p>\n<p>and they forgot about the time. They had been laughing</p>\n<p>quite loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and his robin and Colin</p>\n<p>was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten about</p>\n<p>his weak back when he suddenly remembered something.</p>\n<p>\"Do you know there is one thing we have never</p>",
        "<p>once thought of,\" he said. \"We are cousins.\"</p>\n<p>It seemed so queer that they had talked so much</p>\n<p>and never remembered this simple thing that they laughed more</p>\n<p>than ever, because they had got into the humor to</p>\n<p>laugh at anything. And in the midst of the fun</p>\n<p>the door opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Medlock.</p>",
        "<p>Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost</p>\n<p>fell back because he had accidentally bumped against her.</p>\n<p>\"Good Lord!\" exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock, with her eyes almost</p>\n<p>starting out of her head. \"Good Lord!\"</p>\n<p>\"What is this?\" said Dr. Craven, coming forward. \"What does</p>\n<p>it mean?\"</p>\n<p>Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again. Colin</p>",
        "<p>answered as if neither the doctor's alarm nor Mrs. Medlock's</p>\n<p>terror were of the slightest consequence. He was as little</p>\n<p>disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and dog</p>\n<p>had walked into the room.</p>\n<p>\"This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,\" he said. \"I asked</p>\n<p>her to come and talk to me. I like her.</p>\n<p>She must come and talk to me whenever I send</p>",
        "<p>for her.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, sir,\" she panted. \"I don't know how it's happened.</p>\n<p>There's not a servant on the place that'd dare to</p>\n<p>talk--they all have their orders.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nobody told her anything,\" said Colin, \"she heard me crying</p>\n<p>and found me herself. I am glad she came. Don't</p>",
        "<p>be silly, Medlock.\"</p>\n<p>Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but</p>\n<p>it was quite plain that he dare not oppose his</p>\n<p>patient. He sat down by Colin and felt his pulse.</p>\n<p>\"I am afraid there has been too much excitement. Excitement</p>\n<p>is not good for you, my boy,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I should be excited if she kept away,\" answered Colin,</p>",
        "<p>his eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling. \"I am better.</p>\n<p>She makes me better. The nurse must bring up her</p>\n<p>tea with mine. We will have tea together.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in</p>\n<p>a troubled way, but there was evidently nothing to be</p>\n<p>done.</p>\n<p>\"He does look rather better, sir,\" ventured Mrs. Medlock. \"But\"--thinking</p>",
        "<p>the matter over--\"he looked better this morning before she came</p>\n<p>into the room.\"</p>\n<p>\"She came into the room last night. She stayed with</p>\n<p>me a long time. She sang a Hindustani song to</p>\n<p>me and it made me go to sleep,\" said Colin.</p>\n<p>\"I was better when I wakened up. I wanted my</p>\n<p>breakfast. I want my tea now. Tell nurse, Medlock.\"</p>",
        "<p>Dr. Craven did not stay very long. He talked to</p>\n<p>the nurse for a few minutes when she came into</p>\n<p>the room and said a few words of warning to</p>\n<p>Colin. He must not talk too much; he must not</p>\n<p>forget that he was ill; he must not forget that</p>\n<p>he was very easily tired. Mary thought that there seemed</p>\n<p>to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not</p>",
        "<p>to forget.</p>\n<p>Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed</p>\n<p>on Dr. Craven's face.</p>\n<p>\"I _want_ to forget it,\" he said at last. \"She</p>\n<p>makes me forget it. That is why I want her.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the</p>\n<p>room. He gave a puzzled glance at the little girl</p>",
        "<p>sitting on the large stool. She had become a stiff,</p>\n<p>silent child again as soon as he entered and he</p>\n<p>could not see what the attraction was. The boy actually</p>\n<p>did look brighter, however--and he sighed rather heavily as he</p>\n<p>went down the corridor.</p>\n<p>\"They are always wanting me to eat things when I</p>\n<p>don't want to,\" said Colin, as the nurse brought in</p>",
        "<p>the tea and put it on the table by the</p>\n<p>sofa. \"Now, if you'll eat I will. Those muffins look</p>\n<p>so nice and hot. Tell me about Rajahs.\"</p>"

        "<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>\n<p>NEST BUILDING</p>\n<p>After another week of rain the high arch of blue</p>\n<p>sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was</p>\n<p>quite hot. Though there had been no chance to see</p>\n<p>either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed</p>\n<p>herself very much. The week had not seemed long. She</p>\n<p>had spent hours of every day with Colin in his</p>",
        "<p>room, talking about Rajahs or gardens or Dickon and the</p>\n<p>cottage on the moor. They had looked at the splendid</p>\n<p>books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to</p>\n<p>Colin, and sometimes he had read a little to her.</p>\n<p>When he was amused and interested she thought he scarcely</p>\n<p>looked like an invalid at all, except that his face</p>\n<p>was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.</p>",
        "<p>\"You are a sly young one to listen and get</p>\n<p>out of your bed to go following things up like</p>\n<p>you did that night,\" Mrs. Medlock said once. \"But there's</p>\n<p>no saying it's not been a sort of blessing to</p>\n<p>the lot of us. He's not had a tantrum or</p>\n<p>a whining fit since you made friends. The nurse was</p>\n<p>just going to give up the case because she was</p>",
        "<p>so sick of him, but she says she doesn't mind</p>\n<p>staying now you've gone on duty with her,\" laughing a</p>\n<p>little.</p>\n<p>In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be</p>\n<p>very cautious about the secret garden. There were certain things</p>\n<p>she wanted to find out from him, but she felt</p>\n<p>that she must find them out without asking him direct</p>",
        "<p>questions. In the first place, as she began to like</p>\n<p>to be with him, she wanted to discover whether he</p>\n<p>was the kind of boy you could tell a secret</p>\n<p>to. He was not in the least like Dickon, but</p>\n<p>he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a</p>\n<p>garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps</p>\n<p>he could be trusted. But she had not known him</p>",
        "<p>long enough to be sure. The second thing she wanted</p>\n<p>to find out was this: If he could be trusted--if</p>\n<p>he really could--wouldn't it be possible to take him to</p>\n<p>the garden without having any one find it out? The</p>\n<p>grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air</p>\n<p>and Colin had said that he would not mind fresh</p>\n<p>air in a secret garden. Perhaps if he had a</p>",
        "<p>great deal of fresh air and knew Dickon and the</p>\n<p>robin and saw things growing he might not think so</p>\n<p>much about dying. Mary had seen herself in the glass</p>\n<p>sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite</p>\n<p>a different creature from the child she had seen when</p>\n<p>she arrived from India. This child looked nicer. Even Martha</p>\n<p>had seen a change in her.</p>",
        "<p>\"Th' air from th' moor has done thee good already,\"</p>\n<p>she had said. \"Tha'rt not nigh so yeller and tha'rt</p>\n<p>not nigh so scrawny. Even tha' hair doesn't slamp down</p>\n<p>on tha' head so flat. It's got some life in</p>\n<p>it so as it sticks out a bit.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's like me,\" said Mary. \"It's growing stronger and fatter.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there's more of it.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"It looks it, for sure,\" said Martha, ruffling it up</p>\n<p>a little round her face. \"Tha'rt not half so ugly</p>\n<p>when it's that way an' there's a bit o' red</p>\n<p>in tha' cheeks.\"</p>\n<p>If gardens and fresh air had been good for her</p>\n<p>perhaps they would be good for Colin. But then, if</p>\n<p>he hated people to look at him, perhaps he would</p>",
        "<p>not like to see Dickon.</p>\n<p>\"Why does it make you angry when you are looked</p>\n<p>at?\" she inquired one day.</p>\n<p>\"I always hated it,\" he answered, \"even when I was</p>\n<p>very little. Then when they took me to the seaside</p>\n<p>and I used to lie in my carriage everybody used</p>\n<p>to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my</p>",
        "<p>nurse and then they would begin to whisper and I</p>\n<p>knew then they were saying I shouldn't live to grow</p>\n<p>up. Then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and</p>\n<p>say 'Poor child!' Once when a lady did that I</p>\n<p>screamed out loud and bit her hand. She was so</p>\n<p>frightened she ran away.\"</p>\n<p>\"She thought you had gone mad like a dog,\" said</p>",
        "<p>Mary, not at all admiringly.</p>\n<p>\"I don't care what she thought,\" said Colin, frowning.</p>\n<p>\"I wonder why you didn't scream and bite me when</p>\n<p>I came into your room?\" said Mary. Then she began</p>\n<p>to smile slowly.</p>\n<p>\"I thought you were a ghost or a dream,\" he</p>\n<p>said. \"You can't bite a ghost or a dream, and</p>",
        "<p>if you scream they don't care.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you hate it if--if a boy looked at you?\"</p>\n<p>Mary asked uncertainly.</p>\n<p>He lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>\"There's one boy,\" he said quite slowly, as if he</p>\n<p>were thinking over every word, \"there's one boy I believe</p>\n<p>I shouldn't mind. It's that boy who knows where the</p>",
        "<p>foxes live--Dickon.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure you wouldn't mind him,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"The birds don't and other animals,\" he said, still thinking</p>\n<p>it over, \"perhaps that's why I shouldn't. He's a sort</p>\n<p>of animal charmer and I am a boy animal.\"</p>\n<p>Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it</p>\n<p>ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding</p>",
        "<p>the idea of a boy animal hiding in his hole</p>\n<p>very funny indeed.</p>\n<p>What Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear</p>\n<p>about Dickon.</p>\n<p>* * * * *</p>\n<p>On that first morning when the sky was blue again</p>\n<p>Mary wakened very early. The sun was pouring in slanting</p>",
        "<p>rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous</p>\n<p>in the sight of it that she jumped out of</p>\n<p>bed and ran to the window. She drew up the</p>\n<p>blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft</p>\n<p>of fresh, scented air blew in upon her. The moor</p>\n<p>was blue and the whole world looked as if something</p>\n<p>Magic had happened to it. There were tender little fluting</p>",
        "<p>sounds here and there and everywhere, as if scores of</p>\n<p>birds were beginning to tune up for a concert. Mary</p>\n<p>put her hand out of the window and held it</p>\n<p>in the sun.</p>\n<p>\"It's warm--warm!\" she said. \"It will make the green points</p>\n<p>push up and up and up, and it will make</p>\n<p>the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their</p>",
        "<p>might under the earth.\"</p>\n<p>She kneeled down and leaned out of the window as</p>\n<p>far as she could, breathing big breaths and sniffing the</p>\n<p>air until she laughed because she remembered what Dickon's mother</p>\n<p>had said about the end of his nose quivering like</p>\n<p>a rabbit's.</p>\n<p>\"It must be very early,\" she said. \"The little clouds</p>",
        "<p>are all pink and I've never seen the sky look</p>\n<p>like this. No one is up. I don't even hear</p>\n<p>the stable boys.\"</p>\n<p>A sudden thought made her scramble to her feet.</p>\n<p>\"I can't wait! I am going to see the garden!\"</p>\n<p>She had learned to dress herself by this time and</p>\n<p>she put on her clothes in five minutes. She knew</p>",
        "<p>a small side door which she could unbolt herself and</p>\n<p>she flew down-stairs in her stocking feet and put on</p>\n<p>her shoes in the hall. She unchained and unbolted and</p>\n<p>unlocked and when the door was open she sprang across</p>\n<p>the step with one bound, and there she was standing</p>\n<p>on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and</p>\n<p>with the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet</p>",
        "<p>wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing</p>\n<p>coming from every bush and tree. She clasped her hands</p>\n<p>for pure joy and looked up in the sky and</p>\n<p>it was so blue and pink and pearly and white</p>\n<p>and flooded with springtime light that she felt as if</p>\n<p>she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that</p>\n<p>thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it.</p>",
        "<p>She ran around the shrubs and paths toward the secret</p>\n<p>garden.</p>\n<p>\"It is all different already,\" she said. \"The grass is</p>\n<p>greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are</p>\n<p>uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing. This afternoon</p>\n<p>I am sure Dickon will come.\"</p>\n<p>The long warm rain had done strange things to the</p>",
        "<p>herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall.</p>\n<p>There were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots</p>\n<p>of clumps of plants and there were actually here and</p>\n<p>there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the</p>\n<p>stems of crocuses. Six months before Mistress Mary would not</p>\n<p>have seen how the world was waking up, but now</p>\n<p>she missed nothing.</p>",
        "<p>When she had reached the place where the door hid</p>\n<p>itself under the ivy, she was startled by a curious</p>\n<p>loud sound. It was the caw--caw of a crow and</p>\n<p>it came from the top of the wall, and when</p>\n<p>she looked up, there sat a big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird,</p>\n<p>looking down at her very wisely indeed. She had never</p>\n<p>seen a crow so close before and he made her</p>",
        "<p>a little nervous, but the next moment he spread his</p>\n<p>wings and flapped away across the garden. She hoped he</p>\n<p>was not going to stay inside and she pushed the</p>\n<p>door open wondering if he would. When she got fairly</p>\n<p>into the garden she saw that he probably did intend</p>\n<p>to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf apple-tree,</p>\n<p>and under the apple-tree was lying a little reddish animal</p>",
        "<p>with a bushy tail, and both of them were watching</p>\n<p>the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was</p>\n<p>kneeling on the grass working hard.</p>\n<p>Mary flew across the grass to him.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Dickon! Dickon!\" she cried out. \"How could you get</p>\n<p>here so early! How could you! The sun has only</p>\n<p>just got up!\"</p>",
        "<p>He got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his</p>\n<p>eyes like a bit of the sky.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" he said. \"I was up long before him. How</p>\n<p>could I have stayed abed! Th' world's all fair begun</p>\n<p>again this mornin', it has. An' it's workin' an' hummin'</p>\n<p>an' scratchin' an' pipin' an' nest-buildin' an' breathin' out scents,</p>\n<p>till you've got to be out on it 'stead o'</p>",
        "<p>lyin' on your back. When th' sun did jump up,</p>\n<p>th' moor went mad for joy, an' I was in</p>\n<p>the midst of th' heather, an' I run like mad</p>\n<p>myself, shoutin' an' singin'. An' I come straight here. I</p>\n<p>couldn't have stayed away. Why, th' garden was lyin' here</p>\n<p>waitin'!\"</p>\n<p>Mary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if</p>",
        "<p>she had been running herself.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Dickon! Dickon!\" she said. \"I'm so happy I can</p>\n<p>scarcely breathe!\"</p>\n<p>Seeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal</p>\n<p>rose from its place under the tree and came to</p>\n<p>him, and the rook, cawing once, flew down from its</p>\n<p>branch and settled quietly on his shoulder.</p>",
        "<p>\"This is th' little fox cub,\" he said, rubbing the</p>\n<p>little reddish animal's head. \"It's named Captain. An' this here's</p>\n<p>Soot. Soot he flew across th' moor with me an'</p>\n<p>Captain he run same as if th' hounds had been</p>\n<p>after him. They both felt same as I did.\"</p>\n<p>Neither of the creatures looked as if he were the</p>\n<p>least afraid of Mary. When Dickon began to walk about,</p>",
        "<p>Soot stayed on his shoulder and Captain trotted quietly close</p>\n<p>to his side.</p>\n<p>\"See here!\" said Dickon. \"See how these has pushed up,</p>\n<p>an' these an' these! An' Eh! look at these here!\"</p>\n<p>He threw himself upon his knees and Mary went down</p>\n<p>beside him. They had come upon a whole clump of</p>\n<p>crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold. Mary bent</p>",
        "<p>her face down and kissed and kissed them.</p>\n<p>\"You never kiss a person in that way,\" she said</p>\n<p>when she lifted her head. \"Flowers are so different.\"</p>\n<p>He looked puzzled but smiled.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" he said, \"I've kissed mother many a time that</p>\n<p>way when I come in from th' moor after a</p>\n<p>day's roamin' an' she stood there at th' door in</p>",
        "<p>th' sun, lookin' so glad an' comfortable.\"</p>\n<p>They ran from one part of the garden to another</p>\n<p>and found so many wonders that they were obliged to</p>\n<p>remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low. He</p>\n<p>showed her swelling leaf-buds on rose branches which had seemed</p>\n<p>dead. He showed her ten thousand new green points pushing</p>\n<p>through the mould. They put their eager young noses close</p>",
        "<p>to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they</p>\n<p>dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress</p>\n<p>Mary's hair was as tumbled as Dickon's and her cheeks</p>\n<p>were almost as poppy red as his.</p>\n<p>There was every joy on earth in the secret garden</p>\n<p>that morning, and in the midst of them came a</p>\n<p>delight more delightful than all, because it was more wonderful.</p>",
        "<p>Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the</p>\n<p>trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of</p>\n<p>red-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak. Dickon stood</p>\n<p>quite still and put his hand on Mary almost as</p>\n<p>if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church.</p>\n<p>\"We munnot stir,\" he whispered in broad Yorkshire. \"We munnot</p>\n<p>scarce breathe. I knowed he was mate-huntin' when I seed</p>",
        "<p>him last. It's Ben Weatherstaff's robin. He's buildin' his nest.</p>\n<p>He'll stay here if us don't flight him.\"</p>\n<p>They settled down softly upon the grass and sat there</p>\n<p>without moving.</p>\n<p>\"Us mustn't seem as if us was watchin' him too</p>\n<p>close,\" said Dickon. \"He'd be out with us for good</p>\n<p>if he got th' notion us was interferin' now. He'll</p>",
        "<p>be a good bit different till all this is over.</p>\n<p>He's settin' up housekeepin'. He'll be shyer an' readier to</p>\n<p>take things ill. He's got no time for visitin' an'</p>\n<p>gossipin'. Us must keep still a bit an' try to</p>\n<p>look as if us was grass an' trees an' bushes.</p>\n<p>Then when he's got used to seein' us I'll chirp</p>\n<p>a bit an' he'll know us'll not be in his</p>",
        "<p>way.\"</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew,</p>\n<p>as Dickon seemed to, how to try to look like</p>\n<p>grass and trees and bushes. But he had said the</p>\n<p>queer thing as if it were the simplest and most</p>\n<p>natural thing in the world, and she felt it must</p>\n<p>be quite easy to him, and indeed she watched him</p>",
        "<p>for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible</p>\n<p>for him to quietly turn green and put out branches</p>\n<p>and leaves. But he only sat wonderfully still, and when</p>\n<p>he spoke dropped his voice to such a softness that</p>\n<p>it was curious that she could hear him, but she</p>\n<p>could.</p>\n<p>\"It's part o' th' springtime, this nest-buildin' is,\" he said.</p>",
        "<p>\"I warrant it's been goin' on in th' same way</p>\n<p>every year since th' world was begun. They've got their</p>\n<p>way o' thinkin' and doin' things an' a body had</p>\n<p>better not meddle. You can lose a friend in springtime</p>\n<p>easier than any other season if you're too curious.\"</p>\n<p>\"If we talk about him I can't help looking at</p>\n<p>him,\" Mary said as softly as possible. \"We must talk</p>",
        "<p>of something else. There is something I want to tell</p>\n<p>you.\"</p>\n<p>\"He'll like it better if us talks o' somethin' else,\"</p>\n<p>said Dickon. \"What is it tha's got to tell me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well--do you know about Colin?\" she whispered.</p>\n<p>He turned his head to look at her.</p>\n<p>\"What does tha' know about him?\" he asked.</p>",
        "<p>\"I've seen him. I have been to talk to him</p>\n<p>every day this week. He wants me to come. He</p>\n<p>says I'm making him forget about being ill and dying,\"</p>\n<p>answered Mary.</p>\n<p>Dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died</p>\n<p>away from his round face.</p>\n<p>\"I am glad o' that,\" he exclaimed. \"I'm right down</p>",
        "<p>glad. It makes me easier. I knowed I must say</p>\n<p>nothin' about him an' I don't like havin' to hide</p>\n<p>things.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't you like hiding the garden?\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I'll never tell about it,\" he answered. \"But I says</p>\n<p>to mother, 'Mother,' I says, 'I got a secret to</p>\n<p>keep. It's not a bad 'un, tha' knows that. It's</p>",
        "<p>no worse than hidin' where a bird's nest is. Tha'</p>\n<p>doesn't mind it, does tha'?'\"</p>\n<p>Mary always wanted to hear about mother.</p>\n<p>\"What did she say?\" she asked, not at all afraid</p>\n<p>to hear.</p>\n<p>Dickon grinned sweet-temperedly.</p>\n<p>\"It was just like her, what she said,\" he answered.</p>",
        "<p>\"She give my head a bit of a rub an'</p>\n<p>laughed an' she says, 'Eh, lad, tha' can have all</p>\n<p>th' secrets tha' likes. I've knowed thee twelve year'.'\"</p>\n<p>\"How did you know about Colin?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a</p>\n<p>little lad as was like to be a cripple, an'</p>\n<p>they knowed Mester Craven didn't like him to be talked</p>",
        "<p>about. Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs. Craven</p>\n<p>was such a pretty young lady an' they was so</p>\n<p>fond of each other. Mrs. Medlock stops in our cottage</p>\n<p>whenever she goes to Thwaite an' she doesn't mind talkin'</p>\n<p>to mother before us children, because she knows us has</p>\n<p>been brought up to be trusty. How did tha' find</p>\n<p>out about him? Martha was in fine trouble th' last</p>",
        "<p>time she came home. She said tha'd heard him frettin'</p>\n<p>an' tha' was askin' questions an' she didn't know what</p>\n<p>to say.\"</p>\n<p>Mary told him her story about the midnight wuthering of</p>\n<p>the wind which had wakened her and about the faint</p>\n<p>far-off sounds of the complaining voice which had led her</p>\n<p>down the dark corridors with her candle and had ended</p>",
        "<p>with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted</p>\n<p>room with the carven four-posted bed in the corner. When</p>\n<p>she described the small ivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed</p>\n<p>eyes Dickon shook his head.</p>\n<p>\"Them's just like his mother's eyes, only hers was always</p>\n<p>laughin', they say,\" he said. \"They say as Mr. Craven</p>\n<p>can't bear to see him when he's awake an' it's</p>",
        "<p>because his eyes is so like his mother's an' yet</p>\n<p>looks so different in his miserable bit of a face.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think he wants him to die?\" whispered Mary.</p>\n<p>\"No, but he wishes he'd never been born. Mother she</p>\n<p>says that's th' worst thing on earth for a child.</p>\n<p>Them as is not wanted scarce ever thrives. Mester Craven</p>\n<p>he'd buy anythin' as money could buy for th' poor</p>",
        "<p>lad but he'd like to forget as he's on earth.</p>\n<p>For one thing, he's afraid he'll look at him some</p>\n<p>day and find he's growed hunchback.\"</p>\n<p>\"Colin's so afraid of it himself that he won't sit</p>\n<p>up,\" said Mary. \"He says he's always thinking that if</p>\n<p>he should feel a lump coming he should go crazy</p>\n<p>and scream himself to death.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Eh! he oughtn't to lie there thinkin' things like that,\"</p>\n<p>said Dickon. \"No lad could get well as thought them</p>\n<p>sort o' things.\"</p>\n<p>The fox was lying on the grass close by him</p>\n<p>looking up to ask for a pat now and then,</p>\n<p>and Dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly and</p>\n<p>thought a few minutes in silence. Presently he lifted his</p>",
        "<p>head and looked round the garden.</p>\n<p>\"When first we got in here,\" he said, \"it seemed</p>\n<p>like everything was gray. Look round now and tell me</p>\n<p>if tha' doesn't see a difference.\"</p>\n<p>Mary looked and caught her breath a little.</p>\n<p>\"Why!\" she cried, \"the gray wall is changing. It is</p>\n<p>as if a green mist were creeping over it. It's</p>",
        "<p>almost like a green gauze veil.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye,\" said Dickon. \"An' it'll be greener and greener till</p>\n<p>th' gray's all gone. Can tha' guess what I was</p>\n<p>thinkin'?\"</p>\n<p>\"I know it was something nice,\" said Mary eagerly. \"I</p>\n<p>believe it was something about Colin.\"</p>\n<p>\"I was thinkin' that if he was out here he</p>",
        "<p>wouldn't be watchin' for lumps to grow on his back;</p>\n<p>he'd be watchin' for buds to break on th' rose-bushes,</p>\n<p>an' he'd likely be healthier,\" explained Dickon. \"I was wonderin'</p>\n<p>if us could ever get him in th' humor to</p>\n<p>come out here an' lie under th' trees in his</p>\n<p>carriage.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've been wondering that myself. I've thought of it almost</p>",
        "<p>every time I've talked to him,\" said Mary. \"I've wondered</p>\n<p>if he could keep a secret and I've wondered if</p>\n<p>we could bring him here without any one seeing us.</p>\n<p>I thought perhaps you could push his carriage. The doctor</p>\n<p>said he must have fresh air and if he wants</p>\n<p>us to take him out no one dare disobey him.</p>\n<p>He won't go out for other people and perhaps they</p>",
        "<p>will be glad if he will go out with us.</p>\n<p>He could order the gardeners to keep away so they</p>\n<p>wouldn't find out.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain's back.</p>\n<p>\"It'd be good for him, I'll warrant,\" he said. \"Us'd</p>\n<p>not be thinkin' he'd better never been born. Us'd be</p>\n<p>just two children watchin' a garden grow, an' he'd be</p>",
        "<p>another. Two lads an' a little lass just lookin' on</p>\n<p>at th' springtime. I warrant it'd be better than doctor's</p>\n<p>stuff.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's been lying in his room so long and he's</p>\n<p>always been so afraid of his back that it has</p>\n<p>made him queer,\" said Mary. \"He knows a good many</p>\n<p>things out of books but he doesn't know anything else.</p>",
        "<p>He says he has been too ill to notice things</p>\n<p>and he hates going out of doors and hates gardens</p>\n<p>and gardeners. But he likes to hear about this garden</p>\n<p>because it is a secret. I daren't tell him much</p>\n<p>but he said he wanted to see it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Us'll have him out here sometime for sure,\" said Dickon.</p>\n<p>\"I could push his carriage well enough. Has tha' noticed</p>",
        "<p>how th' robin an' his mate has been workin' while</p>\n<p>we've been sittin' here? Look at him perched on that</p>\n<p>branch wonderin' where it'd be best to put that twig</p>\n<p>he's got in his beak.\"</p>\n<p>He made one of his low whistling calls and the</p>\n<p>robin turned his head and looked at him inquiringly, still</p>\n<p>holding his twig. Dickon spoke to him as Ben Weatherstaff</p>",
        "<p>did, but Dickon's tone was one of friendly advice.</p>\n<p>\"Wheres'ever tha' puts it,\" he said, \"it'll be all right.</p>\n<p>Tha' knew how to build tha' nest before tha' came</p>\n<p>out o' th' egg. Get on with thee, lad. Tha'st</p>\n<p>got no time to lose.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him!\"</p>\n<p>Mary said, laughing delightedly. \"Ben Weatherstaff scolds him and makes</p>",
        "<p>fun of him, and he hops about and looks as</p>\n<p>if he understood every word, and I know he likes</p>\n<p>it. Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would</p>\n<p>rather have stones thrown at him than not be noticed.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon laughed too and went on talking.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' knows us won't trouble thee,\" he said to the</p>\n<p>robin. \"Us is near bein' wild things ourselves. Us is</p>",
        "<p>nest-buildin' too, bless thee. Look out tha' doesn't tell on</p>\n<p>us.\"</p>\n<p>And though the robin did not answer, because his beak</p>\n<p>was occupied, Mary knew that when he flew away with</p>\n<p>his twig to his own corner of the garden the</p>\n<p>darkness of his dew-bright eye meant that he would not</p>\n<p>tell their secret for the world.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>\n<p>\"I WON'T!\" SAID MARY</p>\n<p>They found a great deal to do that morning and</p>\n<p>Mary was late in returning to the house and was</p>\n<p>also in such a hurry to get back to her</p>\n<p>work that she quite forgot Colin until the last moment.</p>\n<p>\"Tell Colin that I can't come and see him yet,\"</p>\n<p>she said to Martha. \"I'm very busy in the garden.\"</p>",
        "<p>Martha looked rather frightened.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! Miss Mary,\" she said, \"it may put him all</p>\n<p>out of humor when I tell him that.\"</p>\n<p>But Mary was not as afraid of him as other</p>\n<p>people were and she was not a self-sacrificing person.</p>\n<p>\"I can't stay,\" she answered. \"Dickon's waiting for me;\" and</p>\n<p>she ran away.</p>",
        "<p>The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning</p>\n<p>had been. Already nearly all the weeds were cleared out</p>\n<p>of the garden and most of the roses and trees</p>\n<p>had been pruned or dug about. Dickon had brought a</p>\n<p>spade of his own and he had taught Mary to</p>\n<p>use all her tools, so that by this time it</p>\n<p>was plain that though the lovely wild place was not</p>",
        "<p>likely to become a \"gardener's garden\" it would be a</p>\n<p>wilderness of growing things before the springtime was over.</p>\n<p>\"There'll be apple blossoms an' cherry blossoms overhead,\" Dickon said,</p>\n<p>working away with all his might. \"An' there'll be peach</p>\n<p>an' plum trees in bloom against th' walls, an' th'</p>\n<p>grass'll be a carpet o' flowers.\"</p>\n<p>The little fox and the rook were as happy and</p>",
        "<p>busy as they were, and the robin and his mate</p>\n<p>flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning. Sometimes</p>\n<p>the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over</p>\n<p>the tree-tops in the park. Each time he came back</p>\n<p>and perched near Dickon and cawed several times as if</p>\n<p>he were relating his adventures, and Dickon talked to him</p>\n<p>just as he had talked to the robin. Once when</p>",
        "<p>Dickon was so busy that he did not answer him</p>\n<p>at first, Soot flew on to his shoulders and gently</p>\n<p>tweaked his ear with his large beak. When Mary wanted</p>\n<p>to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under</p>\n<p>a tree and once he took his pipe out of</p>\n<p>his pocket and played the soft strange little notes and</p>\n<p>two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.</p>",
        "<p>\"Tha's a good bit stronger than tha' was,\" Dickon said,</p>\n<p>looking at her as she was digging. \"Tha's beginning to</p>\n<p>look different, for sure.\"</p>\n<p>Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.</p>\n<p>\"I'm getting fatter and fatter every day,\" she said quite</p>\n<p>exultantly. \"Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger</p>\n<p>dresses. Martha says my hair is growing thicker. It isn't</p>",
        "<p>so flat and stringy.\"</p>\n<p>The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored</p>\n<p>rays slanting under the trees when they parted.</p>\n<p>\"It'll be fine to-morrow,\" said Dickon. \"I'll be at work</p>\n<p>by sunrise.\"</p>\n<p>\"So will I,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>* * * * *</p>",
        "<p>She ran back to the house as quickly as her</p>\n<p>feet would carry her. She wanted to tell Colin about</p>\n<p>Dickon's fox cub and the rook and about what the</p>\n<p>springtime had been doing. She felt sure he would like</p>\n<p>to hear. So it was not very pleasant when she</p>\n<p>opened the door of her room, to see Martha standing</p>\n<p>waiting for her with a doleful face.</p>",
        "<p>\"What is the matter?\" she asked. \"What did Colin say</p>\n<p>when you told him I couldn't come?\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" said Martha, \"I wish tha'd gone. He was nigh</p>\n<p>goin' into one o' his tantrums. There's been a nice</p>\n<p>to do all afternoon to keep him quiet. He would</p>\n<p>watch the clock all th' time.\"</p>\n<p>Mary's lips pinched themselves together. She was no more used</p>",
        "<p>to considering other people than Colin was and she saw</p>\n<p>no reason why an ill-tempered boy should interfere with the</p>\n<p>thing she liked best. She knew nothing about the pitifulness</p>\n<p>of people who had been ill and nervous and who</p>\n<p>did not know that they could control their tempers and</p>\n<p>need not make other people ill and nervous, too. When</p>\n<p>she had had a headache in India she had done</p>",
        "<p>her best to see that everybody else also had a</p>\n<p>headache or something quite as bad. And she felt she</p>\n<p>was quite right; but of course now she felt that</p>\n<p>Colin was quite wrong.</p>\n<p>He was not on his sofa when she went into</p>\n<p>his room. He was lying flat on his back in</p>\n<p>bed and he did not turn his head toward her</p>",
        "<p>as she came in. This was a bad beginning and</p>\n<p>Mary marched up to him with her stiff manner.</p>\n<p>\"Why didn't you get up?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"I did get up this morning when I thought you</p>\n<p>were coming,\" he answered, without looking at her. \"I made</p>\n<p>them put me back in bed this afternoon. My back</p>\n<p>ached and my head ached and I was tired. Why</p>",
        "<p>didn't you come?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was working in the garden with Dickon,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>Colin frowned and condescended to look at her.</p>\n<p>\"I won't let that boy come here if you go</p>\n<p>and stay with him instead of coming to talk to</p>\n<p>me,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Mary flew into a fine passion. She could fly into</p>",
        "<p>a passion without making a noise. She just grew sour</p>\n<p>and obstinate and did not care what happened.</p>\n<p>\"If you send Dickon away, I'll never come into this</p>\n<p>room again!\" she retorted.</p>\n<p>\"You'll have to if I want you,\" said Colin.</p>\n<p>\"I won't!\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I'll make you,\" said Colin, \"They shall drag you in.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Shall they, Mr. Rajah!\" said Mary fiercely. \"They may drag</p>\n<p>me in but they can't make me talk when they</p>\n<p>get me here. I'll sit and clench my teeth and</p>\n<p>never tell you one thing. I won't even look at</p>\n<p>you. I'll stare at the floor!\"</p>\n<p>They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at</p>\n<p>each other. If they had been two little street boys</p>",
        "<p>they would have sprung at each other and had a</p>\n<p>rough-and-tumble fight. As it was, they did the next thing</p>\n<p>to it.</p>\n<p>\"You are a selfish thing!\" cried Colin.</p>\n<p>\"What are you?\" said Mary. \"Selfish people always say that.</p>\n<p>Any one is selfish who doesn't do what they want.</p>\n<p>You're more selfish than I am. You're the most selfish</p>",
        "<p>boy I ever saw.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not!\" snapped Colin. \"I'm not as selfish as your</p>\n<p>fine Dickon is! He keeps you playing in the dirt</p>\n<p>when he knows I am all by myself. He's selfish,</p>\n<p>if you like!\"</p>\n<p>Mary's eyes flashed fire.</p>\n<p>\"He's nicer than any other boy that ever lived!\" she</p>",
        "<p>said. \"He's--he's like an angel!\" It might sound rather silly</p>\n<p>to say that but she did not care.</p>\n<p>\"A nice angel!\" Colin sneered ferociously. \"He's a common cottage</p>\n<p>boy off the moor!\"</p>\n<p>\"He's better than a common Rajah!\" retorted Mary. \"He's a</p>\n<p>thousand times better!\"</p>\n<p>Because she was the stronger of the two she was</p>",
        "<p>beginning to get the better of him. The truth was</p>\n<p>that he had never had a fight with any one</p>\n<p>like himself in his life and, upon the whole, it</p>\n<p>was rather good for him, though neither he nor Mary</p>\n<p>knew anything about that. He turned his head on his</p>\n<p>pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was</p>\n<p>squeezed out and ran down his cheek. He was beginning</p>",
        "<p>to feel pathetic and sorry for himself--not for any one</p>\n<p>else.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not as selfish as you, because I'm always ill,</p>\n<p>and I'm sure there is a lump coming on my</p>\n<p>back,\" he said. \"And I am going to die besides.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're not!\" contradicted Mary unsympathetically.</p>\n<p>He opened his eyes quite wide with indignation. He had</p>",
        "<p>never heard such a thing said before. He was at</p>\n<p>once furious and slightly pleased, if a person could be</p>\n<p>both at the same time.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not?\" he cried. \"I am! You know I am!</p>\n<p>Everybody says so.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't believe it!\" said Mary sourly. \"You just say</p>\n<p>that to make people sorry. I believe you're proud of</p>",
        "<p>it. I don't believe it! If you were a nice</p>\n<p>boy it might be true--but you're too nasty!\"</p>\n<p>In spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in</p>\n<p>bed in quite a healthy rage.</p>\n<p>\"Get out of the room!\" he shouted and he caught</p>\n<p>hold of his pillow and threw it at her. He</p>\n<p>was not strong enough to throw it far and it</p>",
        "<p>only fell at her feet, but Mary's face looked as</p>\n<p>pinched as a nutcracker.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going,\" she said. \"And I won't come back!\"</p>\n<p>She walked to the door and when she reached it</p>\n<p>she turned round and spoke again.</p>\n<p>\"I was going to tell you all sorts of nice</p>\n<p>things,\" she said. \"Dickon brought his fox and his rook</p>",
        "<p>and I was going to tell you all about them.</p>\n<p>Now I won't tell you a single thing!\"</p>\n<p>She marched out of the door and closed it behind</p>\n<p>her, and there to her great astonishment she found the</p>\n<p>trained nurse standing as if she had been listening and,</p>\n<p>more amazing still--she was laughing. She was a big handsome</p>\n<p>young woman who ought not to have been a trained</p>",
        "<p>nurse at all, as she could not bear invalids and</p>\n<p>she was always making excuses to leave Colin to Martha</p>\n<p>or any one else who would take her place. Mary</p>\n<p>had never liked her, and she simply stood and gazed</p>\n<p>up at her as she stood giggling into her handkerchief.</p>\n<p>\"What are you laughing at?\" she asked her.</p>\n<p>\"At you two young ones,\" said the nurse. \"It's the</p>",
        "<p>best thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing</p>\n<p>to have some one to stand up to him that's</p>\n<p>as spoiled as himself;\" and she laughed into her handkerchief</p>\n<p>again. \"If he'd had a young vixen of a sister</p>\n<p>to fight with it would have been the saving of</p>\n<p>him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is he going to die?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I don't know and I don't care,\" said the nurse.</p>\n<p>\"Hysterics and temper are half what ails him.\"</p>\n<p>\"What are hysterics?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"You'll find out if you work him into a tantrum</p>\n<p>after this--but at any rate you've given him something to</p>\n<p>have hysterics about, and I'm glad of it.\"</p>\n<p>Mary went back to her room not feeling at all</p>",
        "<p>as she had felt when she had come in from</p>\n<p>the garden. She was cross and disappointed but not at</p>\n<p>all sorry for Colin. She had looked forward to telling</p>\n<p>him a great many things and she had meant to</p>\n<p>try to make up her mind whether it would be</p>\n<p>safe to trust him with the great secret. She had</p>\n<p>been beginning to think it would be, but now she</p>",
        "<p>had changed her mind entirely. She would never tell him</p>\n<p>and he could stay in his room and never get</p>\n<p>any fresh air and die if he liked! It would</p>\n<p>serve him right! She felt so sour and unrelenting that</p>\n<p>for a few minutes she almost forgot about Dickon and</p>\n<p>the green veil creeping over the world and the soft</p>\n<p>wind blowing down from the moor.</p>",
        "<p>Martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her</p>\n<p>face had been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity. There</p>\n<p>was a wooden box on the table and its cover</p>\n<p>had been removed and revealed that it was full of</p>\n<p>neat packages.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Craven sent it to you,\" said Martha. \"It looks</p>\n<p>as if it had picture-books in it.\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary remembered what he had asked her the day she</p>\n<p>had gone to his room. \"Do you want anything--dolls--toys--books?\" She</p>\n<p>opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll,</p>\n<p>and also wondering what she should do with it if</p>\n<p>he had. But he had not sent one. There were</p>\n<p>several beautiful books such as Colin had, and two of</p>\n<p>them were about gardens and were full of pictures. There</p>",
        "<p>were two or three games and there was a beautiful</p>\n<p>little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a</p>\n<p>gold pen and inkstand.</p>\n<p>Everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd</p>\n<p>her anger out of her mind. She had not expected</p>\n<p>him to remember her at all and her hard little</p>\n<p>heart grew quite warm.</p>",
        "<p>\"I can write better than I can print,\" she said,</p>\n<p>\"and the first thing I shall write with that pen</p>\n<p>will be a letter to tell him I am much</p>\n<p>obliged.\"</p>\n<p>If she had been friends with Colin she would have</p>\n<p>run to show him her presents at once, and they</p>\n<p>would have looked at the pictures and read some of</p>",
        "<p>the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and</p>\n<p>he would have enjoyed himself so much he would never</p>\n<p>once have thought he was going to die or have</p>\n<p>put his hand on his spine to see if there</p>\n<p>was a lump coming. He had a way of doing</p>\n<p>that which she could not bear. It gave her an</p>\n<p>uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked so frightened himself.</p>",
        "<p>He said that if he felt even quite a little</p>\n<p>lump some day he should know his hunch had begun</p>\n<p>to grow. Something he had heard Mrs. Medlock whispering to</p>\n<p>the nurse had given him the idea and he had</p>\n<p>thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly</p>\n<p>fixed in his mind. Mrs. Medlock had said his father's</p>\n<p>back had begun to show its crookedness in that way</p>",
        "<p>when he was a child. He had never told any</p>\n<p>one but Mary that most of his \"tantrums\" as they</p>\n<p>called them grew out of his hysterical hidden fear. Mary</p>\n<p>had been sorry for him when he had told her.</p>\n<p>\"He always began to think about it when he was</p>\n<p>cross or tired,\" she said to herself. \"And he has</p>\n<p>been cross to-day. Perhaps--perhaps he has been thinking about it</p>",
        "<p>all afternoon.\"</p>\n<p>She stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.</p>\n<p>\"I said I would never go back again--\" she hesitated,</p>\n<p>knitting her brows--\"but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and</p>\n<p>see--if he wants me--in the morning. Perhaps he'll try to</p>\n<p>throw his pillow at me again, but--I think--I'll go.\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>\n<p>A TANTRUM</p>\n<p>She had got up very early in the morning and</p>\n<p>had worked hard in the garden and she was tired</p>\n<p>and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought her</p>\n<p>supper and she had eaten it, she was glad to</p>\n<p>go to bed. As she laid her head on the</p>\n<p>pillow she murmured to herself:</p>",
        "<p>\"I'll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and</p>\n<p>then afterward--I believe--I'll go to see him.\"</p>\n<p>She thought it was the middle of the night when</p>\n<p>she was wakened by such dreadful sounds that she jumped</p>\n<p>out of bed in an instant. What was it--what was</p>\n<p>it? The next minute she felt quite sure she knew.</p>\n<p>Doors were opened and shut and there were hurrying feet</p>",
        "<p>in the corridors and some one was crying and screaming</p>\n<p>at the same time, screaming and crying in a horrible</p>\n<p>way.</p>\n<p>\"It's Colin,\" she said. \"He's having one of those tantrums</p>\n<p>the nurse called hysterics. How awful it sounds.\"</p>\n<p>As she listened to the sobbing screams she did not</p>\n<p>wonder that people were so frightened that they gave him</p>",
        "<p>his own way in everything rather than hear them. She</p>\n<p>put her hands over her ears and felt sick and</p>\n<p>shivering.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what to do. I don't know what</p>\n<p>to do,\" she kept saying. \"I can't bear it.\"</p>\n<p>Once she wondered if he would stop if she dared</p>\n<p>go to him and then she remembered how he had</p>",
        "<p>driven her out of the room and thought that perhaps</p>\n<p>the sight of her might make him worse. Even when</p>\n<p>she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she</p>\n<p>could not keep the awful sounds out. She hated them</p>\n<p>so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they</p>\n<p>began to make her angry and she felt as if</p>\n<p>she should like to fly into a tantrum herself and</p>",
        "<p>frighten him as he was frightening her. She was not</p>\n<p>used to any one's tempers but her own. She took</p>\n<p>her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped</p>\n<p>her foot.</p>\n<p>\"He ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him</p>\n<p>stop! Somebody ought to beat him!\" she cried out.</p>\n<p>Just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor</p>",
        "<p>and her door opened and the nurse came in. She</p>\n<p>was not laughing now by any means. She even looked</p>\n<p>rather pale.</p>\n<p>\"He's worked himself into hysterics,\" she said in a great</p>\n<p>hurry. \"He'll do himself harm. No one can do anything</p>\n<p>with him. You come and try, like a good child.</p>\n<p>He likes you.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"He turned me out of the room this morning,\" said</p>\n<p>Mary, stamping her foot with excitement.</p>\n<p>The stamp rather pleased the nurse. The truth was that</p>\n<p>she had been afraid she might find Mary crying and</p>\n<p>hiding her head under the bed-clothes.</p>\n<p>\"That's right,\" she said. \"You're in the right humor. You</p>\n<p>go and scold him. Give him something new to think</p>",
        "<p>of. Do go, child, as quick as ever you can.\"</p>\n<p>It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the</p>\n<p>thing had been funny as well as dreadful--that it was</p>\n<p>funny that all the grown-up people were so frightened that</p>\n<p>they came to a little girl just because they guessed</p>\n<p>she was almost as bad as Colin himself.</p>\n<p>She flew along the corridor and the nearer she got</p>",
        "<p>to the screams the higher her temper mounted. She felt</p>\n<p>quite wicked by the time she reached the door. She</p>\n<p>slapped it open with her hand and ran across the</p>\n<p>room to the four-posted bed.</p>\n<p>\"You stop!\" she almost shouted. \"You stop! I hate you!</p>\n<p>Everybody hates you! I wish everybody would run out of</p>\n<p>the house and let you scream yourself to death! You</p>",
        "<p>_will_ scream yourself to death in a minute, and I</p>\n<p>wish you would!\"</p>\n<p>A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said</p>\n<p>such things, but it just happened that the shock of</p>\n<p>hearing them was the best possible thing for this hysterical</p>\n<p>boy whom no one had ever dared to restrain or</p>\n<p>contradict.</p>",
        "<p>He had been lying on his face beating his pillow</p>\n<p>with his hands and he actually almost jumped around, he</p>\n<p>turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little</p>\n<p>voice. His face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen,</p>\n<p>and he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary</p>\n<p>did not care an atom.</p>\n<p>\"If you scream another scream,\" she said, \"I'll scream too--and</p>",
        "<p>I can scream louder than you can and I'll frighten</p>\n<p>you, I'll frighten you!\"</p>\n<p>He actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him</p>\n<p>so. The scream which had been coming almost choked him.</p>\n<p>The tears were streaming down his face and he shook</p>\n<p>all over.</p>\n<p>\"I can't stop!\" he gasped and sobbed. \"I can't--I can't!\"</p>",
        "<p>\"You can!\" shouted Mary. \"Half that ails you is hysterics</p>\n<p>and temper--just hysterics--hysterics--hysterics!\" and she stamped each time she said</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>\"I felt the lump--I felt it,\" choked out Colin. \"I</p>\n<p>knew I should. I shall have a hunch on my</p>\n<p>back and then I shall die,\" and he began to</p>\n<p>writhe again and turned on his face and sobbed and</p>",
        "<p>wailed but he didn't scream.</p>\n<p>\"You didn't feel a lump!\" contradicted Mary fiercely. \"If you</p>\n<p>did it was only a hysterical lump. Hysterics makes lumps.</p>\n<p>There's nothing the matter with your horrid back--nothing but hysterics!</p>\n<p>Turn over and let me look at it!\"</p>\n<p>She liked the word \"hysterics\" and felt somehow as if</p>\n<p>it had an effect on him. He was probably like</p>",
        "<p>herself and had never heard it before.</p>\n<p>\"Nurse,\" she commanded, \"come here and show me his back</p>\n<p>this minute!\"</p>\n<p>The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled</p>\n<p>together near the door staring at her, their mouths half</p>\n<p>open. All three had gasped with fright more than once.</p>\n<p>The nurse came forward as if she were half afraid.</p>",
        "<p>Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps he--he won't let me,\" she hesitated in a low</p>\n<p>voice.</p>\n<p>Colin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two</p>\n<p>sobs:</p>\n<p>\"Sh--show her! She--she'll see then!\"</p>\n<p>It was a poor thin back to look at when</p>",
        "<p>it was bared. Every rib could be counted and every</p>\n<p>joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not count</p>\n<p>them as she bent over and examined them with a</p>\n<p>solemn savage little face. She looked so sour and old-fashioned</p>\n<p>that the nurse turned her head aside to hide the</p>\n<p>twitching of her mouth. There was just a minute's silence,</p>\n<p>for even Colin tried to hold his breath while Mary</p>",
        "<p>looked up and down his spine, and down and up,</p>\n<p>as intently as if she had been the great doctor</p>\n<p>from London.</p>\n<p>\"There's not a single lump there!\" she said at last.</p>\n<p>\"There's not a lump as big as a pin--except backbone</p>\n<p>lumps, and you can only feel them because you're thin.</p>\n<p>I've got backbone lumps myself, and they used to stick</p>",
        "<p>out as much as yours do, until I began to</p>\n<p>get fatter, and I am not fat enough yet to</p>\n<p>hide them. There's not a lump as big as a</p>\n<p>pin! If you ever say there is again, I shall</p>\n<p>laugh!\"</p>\n<p>No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly</p>\n<p>spoken childish words had on him. If he had ever</p>",
        "<p>had any one to talk to about his secret terrors--if</p>\n<p>he had ever dared to let himself ask questions--if he</p>\n<p>had had childish companions and had not lain on his</p>\n<p>back in the huge closed house, breathing an atmosphere heavy</p>\n<p>with the fears of people who were most of them</p>\n<p>ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out</p>\n<p>that most of his fright and illness was created by</p>",
        "<p>himself. But he had lain and thought of himself and</p>\n<p>his aches and weariness for hours and days and months</p>\n<p>and years. And now that an angry unsympathetic little girl</p>\n<p>insisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he</p>\n<p>thought he was he actually felt as if she might</p>\n<p>be speaking the truth.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't know,\" ventured the nurse, \"that he thought he</p>",
        "<p>had a lump on his spine. His back is weak</p>\n<p>because he won't try to sit up. I could have</p>\n<p>told him there was no lump there.\"</p>\n<p>Colin gulped and turned his face a little to look</p>\n<p>at her.</p>\n<p>\"C-could you?\" he said pathetically.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"There!\" said Mary, and she gulped too.</p>\n<p>Colin turned on his face again and but for his</p>\n<p>long-drawn broken breaths, which were the dying down of his</p>\n<p>storm of sobbing, he lay still for a minute, though</p>\n<p>great tears streamed down his face and wet the pillow.</p>\n<p>Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had</p>\n<p>come to him. Presently he turned and looked at the</p>",
        "<p>nurse again and strangely enough he was not like a</p>\n<p>Rajah at all as he spoke to her.</p>\n<p>\"Do you think--I could--live to grow up?\" he said.</p>\n<p>The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she could</p>\n<p>repeat some of the London doctor's words.</p>\n<p>\"You probably will if you will do what you are</p>\n<p>told to do and not give way to your temper,</p>",
        "<p>and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.\"</p>\n<p>Colin's tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn</p>\n<p>out with crying and this perhaps made him feel gentle.</p>\n<p>He put out his hand a little toward Mary, and</p>\n<p>I am glad to say that, her own tantrum having</p>\n<p>passed, she was softened too and met him half-way with</p>\n<p>her hand, so that it was a sort of making</p>",
        "<p>up.</p>\n<p>\"I'll--I'll go out with you, Mary,\" he said. \"I shan't</p>\n<p>hate fresh air if we can find--\" He remembered just</p>\n<p>in time to stop himself from saying \"if we can</p>\n<p>find the secret garden\" and he ended, \"I shall like</p>\n<p>to go out with you if Dickon will come and</p>\n<p>push my chair. I do so want to see Dickon</p>",
        "<p>and the fox and the crow.\"</p>\n<p>The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened</p>\n<p>the pillows. Then she made Colin a cup of beef</p>\n<p>tea and gave a cup to Mary, who really was</p>\n<p>very glad to get it after her excitement. Mrs. Medlock</p>\n<p>and Martha gladly slipped away, and after everything was neat</p>\n<p>and calm and in order the nurse looked as if</p>",
        "<p>she would very gladly slip away also. She was a</p>\n<p>healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her sleep</p>\n<p>and she yawned quite openly as she looked at Mary,</p>\n<p>who had pushed her big footstool close to the four-posted</p>\n<p>bed and was holding Colin's hand.</p>\n<p>\"You must go back and get your sleep out,\" she</p>\n<p>said. \"He'll drop off after a while--if he's not too</p>",
        "<p>upset. Then I'll lie down myself in the next room.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you like me to sing you that song I</p>\n<p>learned from my Ayah?\" Mary whispered to Colin.</p>\n<p>His hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired</p>\n<p>eyes on her appealingly.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yes!\" he answered. \"It's such a soft song. I</p>\n<p>shall go to sleep in a minute.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I will put him to sleep,\" Mary said to the</p>\n<p>yawning nurse. \"You can go if you like.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance. \"If</p>\n<p>he doesn't go to sleep in half an hour you</p>\n<p>must call me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Very well,\" answered Mary.</p>\n<p>The nurse was out of the room in a minute</p>",
        "<p>and as soon as she was gone Colin pulled Mary's</p>\n<p>hand again.</p>\n<p>\"I almost told,\" he said; \"but I stopped myself in</p>\n<p>time. I won't talk and I'll go to sleep, but</p>\n<p>you said you had a whole lot of nice things</p>\n<p>to tell me. Have you--do you think you have found</p>\n<p>out anything at all about the way into the secret</p>",
        "<p>garden?\"</p>\n<p>Mary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen</p>\n<p>eyes and her heart relented.</p>\n<p>\"Ye-es,\" she answered, \"I think I have. And if you</p>\n<p>will go to sleep I will tell you to-morrow.\"</p>\n<p>His hand quite trembled.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Mary!\" he said. \"Oh, Mary! If I could get</p>",
        "<p>into it I think I should live to grow up!</p>\n<p>Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah song--you</p>\n<p>could just tell me softly as you did that first</p>\n<p>day what you imagine it looks like inside? I am</p>\n<p>sure it will make me go to sleep.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Mary. \"Shut your eyes.\"</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes and lay quite still and she</p>",
        "<p>held his hand and began to speak very slowly and</p>\n<p>in a very low voice.</p>\n<p>\"I think it has been left alone so long--that it</p>\n<p>has grown all into a lovely tangle. I think the</p>\n<p>roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang</p>\n<p>from the branches and walls and creep over the ground--almost</p>\n<p>like a strange gray mist. Some of them have died</p>",
        "<p>but many--are alive and when the summer comes there will</p>\n<p>be curtains and fountains of roses. I think the ground</p>\n<p>is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris</p>\n<p>working their way out of the dark. Now the spring</p>\n<p>has begun--perhaps--perhaps--\"</p>\n<p>The soft drone of her voice was making him stiller</p>\n<p>and stiller and she saw it and went on.</p>",
        "<p>\"Perhaps they are coming up through the grass--perhaps there are</p>\n<p>clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones--even now. Perhaps the</p>\n<p>leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl--and perhaps--the gray</p>\n<p>is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping--and creeping</p>\n<p>over--everything. And the birds are coming to look at it--because</p>\n<p>it is--so safe and still. And perhaps--perhaps--perhaps--\" very softly and</p>\n<p>slowly indeed, \"the robin has found a mate--and is building</p>",
        "<p>a nest.\"</p>\n<p>And Colin was asleep.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>\n<p>\"THA' MUNNOT WASTE NO TIME\"</p>\n<p>Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning.</p>\n<p>She slept late because she was tired, and when Martha</p>\n<p>brought her breakfast she told her that though Colin was</p>\n<p>quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always</p>\n<p>was after he had worn himself out with a fit</p>\n<p>of crying. Mary ate her breakfast slowly as she listened.</p>",
        "<p>\"He says he wishes tha' would please go and see</p>\n<p>him as soon as tha' can,\" Martha said. \"It's queer</p>\n<p>what a fancy he's took to thee. Tha' did give</p>\n<p>it him last night for sure--didn't tha'? Nobody else would</p>\n<p>have dared to do it. Eh! poor lad! He's been</p>\n<p>spoiled till salt won't save him. Mother says as th'</p>\n<p>two worst things as can happen to a child is</p>",
        "<p>never to have his own way--or always to have it.</p>\n<p>She doesn't know which is th' worst. Tha' was in</p>\n<p>a fine temper tha'self, too. But he says to me</p>\n<p>when I went into his room, 'Please ask Miss Mary</p>\n<p>if she'll please come an' talk to me?' Think o'</p>\n<p>him saying please! Will you go, Miss?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll run and see Dickon first,\" said Mary. \"No, I'll</p>",
        "<p>go and see Colin first and tell him--I know what</p>\n<p>I'll tell him,\" with a sudden inspiration.</p>\n<p>She had her hat on when she appeared in Colin's</p>\n<p>room and for a second he looked disappointed. He was</p>\n<p>in bed and his face was pitifully white and there</p>\n<p>were dark circles round his eyes.</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad you came,\" he said. \"My head aches and</p>",
        "<p>I ache all over because I'm so tired. Are you</p>\n<p>going somewhere?\"</p>\n<p>Mary went and leaned against his bed.</p>\n<p>\"I won't be long,\" she said. \"I'm going to Dickon,</p>\n<p>but I'll come back. Colin, it's--it's something about the secret</p>\n<p>garden.\"</p>\n<p>His whole face brightened and a little color came into</p>",
        "<p>it.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! is it!\" he cried out. \"I dreamed about it</p>\n<p>all night. I heard you say something about gray changing</p>\n<p>into green, and I dreamed I was standing in a</p>\n<p>place all filled with trembling little green leaves--and there were</p>\n<p>birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and</p>\n<p>still. I'll lie and think about it until you come</p>",
        "<p>back.\"</p>\n<p>In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden.</p>\n<p>The fox and the crow were with him again and</p>\n<p>this time he had brought two tame squirrels.</p>\n<p>\"I came over on the pony this mornin',\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! he is a good little chap--Jump is! I brought</p>\n<p>these two in my pockets. This here one he's called</p>",
        "<p>Nut an' this here other one's called Shell.\"</p>\n<p>When he said \"Nut\" one squirrel leaped on to his</p>\n<p>right shoulder and when he said \"Shell\" the other one</p>\n<p>leaped on to his left shoulder.</p>\n<p>When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled</p>\n<p>at their feet, Soot solemnly listening on a tree and</p>\n<p>Nut and Shell nosing about close to them, it seemed</p>",
        "<p>to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave</p>\n<p>such delightfulness, but when she began to tell her story</p>\n<p>somehow the look in Dickon's funny face gradually changed her</p>\n<p>mind. She could see he felt sorrier for Colin than</p>\n<p>she did. He looked up at the sky and all</p>\n<p>about him.</p>\n<p>\"Just listen to them birds--th' world seems full of 'em--all</p>",
        "<p>whistlin' an' pipin',\" he said. \"Look at 'em dartin' about,</p>\n<p>an' hearken at 'em callin' to each other. Come springtime</p>\n<p>seems like as if all th' world's callin'. The leaves</p>\n<p>is uncurlin' so you can see 'em--an', my word, th'</p>\n<p>nice smells there is about!\" sniffing with his happy turned-up</p>\n<p>nose. \"An' that poor lad lyin' shut up an' seein'</p>\n<p>so little that he gets to thinkin' o' things as</p>",
        "<p>sets him screamin'. Eh! my! we mun get him out</p>\n<p>here--we mun get him watchin' an' listenin' an' sniffin' up</p>\n<p>th' air an' get him just soaked through wi' sunshine.</p>\n<p>An' we munnot lose no time about it.\"</p>\n<p>When he was very much interested he often spoke quite</p>\n<p>broad Yorkshire though at other times he tried to modify</p>\n<p>his dialect so that Mary could better understand. But she</p>",
        "<p>loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact been trying</p>\n<p>to learn to speak it herself. So she spoke a</p>\n<p>little now.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that we mun,\" she said (which meant \"Yes, indeed,</p>\n<p>we must\"). \"I'll tell thee what us'll do first,\" she</p>\n<p>proceeded, and Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried</p>\n<p>to twist her tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused him</p>",
        "<p>very much. \"He's took a graidely fancy to thee. He</p>\n<p>wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot</p>\n<p>an' Captain. When I go back to the house to</p>\n<p>talk to him I'll ax him if tha' canna' come</p>\n<p>an' see him to-morrow mornin'--an' bring tha' creatures wi' thee--an'</p>\n<p>then--in a bit, when there's more leaves out, an' happen</p>\n<p>a bud or two, we'll get him to come out</p>",
        "<p>an' tha' shall push him in his chair an' we'll</p>\n<p>bring him here an' show him everything.\"</p>\n<p>When she stopped she was quite proud of herself. She</p>\n<p>had never made a long speech in Yorkshire before and</p>\n<p>she had remembered very well.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' mun talk a bit o' Yorkshire like that to</p>\n<p>Mester Colin,\" Dickon chuckled. \"Tha'll make him laugh an' there's</p>",
        "<p>nowt as good for ill folk as laughin' is. Mother</p>\n<p>says she believes as half a hour's good laugh every</p>\n<p>mornin' 'ud cure a chap as was makin' ready for</p>\n<p>typhus fever.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,\"</p>\n<p>said Mary, chuckling herself.</p>\n<p>The garden had reached the time when every day and</p>",
        "<p>every night it seemed as if Magicians were passing through</p>\n<p>it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the boughs</p>\n<p>with wands. It was hard to go away and leave</p>\n<p>it all, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to</p>\n<p>her dress and Shell had scrambled down the trunk of</p>\n<p>the apple-tree they sat under and stayed there looking at</p>\n<p>her with inquiring eyes. But she went back to the</p>",
        "<p>house and when she sat down close to Colin's bed</p>\n<p>he began to sniff as Dickon did though not in</p>\n<p>such an experienced way.</p>\n<p>\"You smell like flowers and--and fresh things,\" he cried out</p>\n<p>quite joyously. \"What is it you smell of? It's cool</p>\n<p>and warm and sweet all at the same time.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's th' wind from th' moor,\" said Mary. \"It comes</p>",
        "<p>o' sittin' on th' grass under a tree wi' Dickon</p>\n<p>an' wi' Captain an' Soot an' Nut an' Shell. It's</p>\n<p>th' springtime an' out o' doors an' sunshine as smells</p>\n<p>so graidely.\"</p>\n<p>She said it as broadly as she could, and you</p>\n<p>do not know how broadly Yorkshire sounds until you have</p>\n<p>heard some one speak it. Colin began to laugh.</p>",
        "<p>\"What are you doing?\" he said. \"I never heard you</p>\n<p>talk like that before. How funny it sounds.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm givin' thee a bit o' Yorkshire,\" answered Mary triumphantly.</p>\n<p>\"I canna' talk as graidely as Dickon an' Martha can</p>\n<p>but tha' sees I can shape a bit. Doesn't tha'</p>\n<p>understand a bit o' Yorkshire when tha' hears it? An'</p>\n<p>tha' a Yorkshire lad thysel' bred an' born! Eh! I</p>",
        "<p>wonder tha'rt not ashamed o' thy face.\"</p>\n<p>And then she began to laugh too and they both</p>\n<p>laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed</p>\n<p>until the room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door</p>\n<p>to come in drew back into the corridor and stood</p>\n<p>listening amazed.</p>\n<p>\"Well, upon my word!\" she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire</p>",
        "<p>herself because there was no one to hear her and</p>\n<p>she was so astonished. \"Whoever heard th' like! Whoever on</p>\n<p>earth would ha' thought it!\"</p>\n<p>There was so much to talk about. It seemed as</p>\n<p>if Colin could never hear enough of Dickon and Captain</p>\n<p>and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony whose</p>\n<p>name was Jump. Mary had run round into the wood</p>",
        "<p>with Dickon to see Jump. He was a tiny little</p>\n<p>shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his eyes</p>\n<p>and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose.</p>\n<p>He was rather thin with living on moor grass but</p>\n<p>he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle</p>\n<p>in his little legs had been made of steel springs.</p>\n<p>He had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment</p>",
        "<p>he saw Dickon and he had trotted up to him</p>\n<p>and put his head across his shoulder and then Dickon</p>\n<p>had talked into his ear and Jump had talked back</p>\n<p>in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts. Dickon had</p>\n<p>made him give Mary his small front hoof and kiss</p>\n<p>her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle.</p>\n<p>\"Does he really understand everything Dickon says?\" Colin asked.</p>",
        "<p>\"It seems as if he does,\" answered Mary. \"Dickon says</p>\n<p>anything will understand if you're friends with it for sure,</p>\n<p>but you have to be friends for sure.\"</p>\n<p>Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray</p>\n<p>eyes seemed to be staring at the wall, but Mary</p>\n<p>saw he was thinking.</p>\n<p>\"I wish I was friends with things,\" he said at</p>",
        "<p>last, \"but I'm not. I never had anything to be</p>\n<p>friends with, and I can't bear people.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't you bear me?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I can,\" he answered. \"It's very funny but I</p>\n<p>even like you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,\" said Mary. \"He</p>\n<p>said he'd warrant we'd both got the same nasty tempers.</p>",
        "<p>I think you are like him too. We are all</p>\n<p>three alike--you and I and Ben Weatherstaff. He said we</p>\n<p>were neither of us much to look at and we</p>\n<p>were as sour as we looked. But I don't feel</p>\n<p>as sour as I used to before I knew the</p>\n<p>robin and Dickon.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you feel as if you hated people?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Yes,\" answered Mary without any affectation. \"I should have detested</p>\n<p>you if I had seen you before I saw the</p>\n<p>robin and Dickon.\"</p>\n<p>Colin put out his thin hand and touched her.</p>\n<p>\"Mary,\" he said, \"I wish I hadn't said what I</p>\n<p>did about sending Dickon away. I hated you when you</p>\n<p>said he was like an angel and I laughed at</p>",
        "<p>you but--but perhaps he is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, it was rather funny to say it,\" she admitted</p>\n<p>frankly, \"because his nose does turn up and he has</p>\n<p>a big mouth and his clothes have patches all over</p>\n<p>them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but--but if an angel</p>\n<p>did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor--if there</p>\n<p>was a Yorkshire angel--I believe he'd understand the green things</p>",
        "<p>and know how to make them grow and he would</p>\n<p>know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon</p>\n<p>does and they'd know he was friends for sure.\"</p>\n<p>\"I shouldn't mind Dickon looking at me,\" said Colin; \"I</p>\n<p>want to see him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad you said that,\" answered Mary, \"because--because--\"</p>\n<p>Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was</p>",
        "<p>the minute to tell him. Colin knew something new was</p>\n<p>coming.</p>\n<p>\"Because what?\" he cried eagerly.</p>\n<p>Mary was so anxious that she got up from her</p>\n<p>stool and came to him and caught hold of both</p>\n<p>his hands.</p>\n<p>\"Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted</p>",
        "<p>him. Can I trust you--for sure--_for sure_?\" she implored.</p>\n<p>Her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his</p>\n<p>answer.</p>\n<p>\"Yes--yes!\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, Dickon will come to see you to-morrow morning, and</p>\n<p>he'll bring his creatures with him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Oh!\" Colin cried out in delight.</p>",
        "<p>\"But that's not all,\" Mary went on, almost pale with</p>\n<p>solemn excitement. \"The rest is better. There is a door</p>\n<p>into the garden. I found it. It is under the</p>\n<p>ivy on the wall.\"</p>\n<p>If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would</p>\n<p>probably have shouted \"Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!\" but he was weak</p>\n<p>and rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger and</p>",
        "<p>he gasped for breath.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Mary!\" he cried out with a half sob. \"Shall</p>\n<p>I see it? Shall I get into it? Shall I</p>\n<p>_live_ to get into it?\" and he clutched her hands</p>\n<p>and dragged her toward him.</p>\n<p>\"Of course you'll see it!\" snapped Mary indignantly. \"Of course</p>\n<p>you'll live to get into it! Don't be silly!\"</p>",
        "<p>And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that</p>\n<p>she brought him to his senses and he began to</p>\n<p>laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward she was</p>\n<p>sitting on her stool again telling him not what she</p>\n<p>imagined the secret garden to be like but what it</p>\n<p>really was, and Colin's aches and tiredness were forgotten and</p>\n<p>he was listening enraptured.</p>",
        "<p>\"It is just what you thought it would be,\" he</p>\n<p>said at last. \"It sounds just as if you had</p>\n<p>really seen it. You know I said that when you</p>\n<p>told me first.\"</p>\n<p>Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the</p>\n<p>truth.</p>\n<p>\"I had seen it--and I had been in,\" she said.</p>",
        "<p>\"I found the key and got in weeks ago. But</p>\n<p>I daren't tell you--I daren't because I was so afraid</p>\n<p>I couldn't trust you--_for sure_!\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>\n<p>\"IT HAS COME!\"</p>\n<p>Of course Dr. Craven had been sent for the morning</p>\n<p>after Colin had had his tantrum. He was always sent</p>\n<p>for at once when such a thing occurred and he</p>\n<p>always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying</p>\n<p>on his bed, sulky and still so hysterical that he</p>\n<p>was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least</p>",
        "<p>word. In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and detested the difficulties</p>\n<p>of these visits. On this occasion he was away from</p>\n<p>Misselthwaite Manor until afternoon.</p>\n<p>\"How is he?\" he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when</p>\n<p>he arrived. \"He will break a blood-vessel in one of</p>\n<p>those fits some day. The boy is half insane with</p>\n<p>hysteria and self-indulgence.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Well, sir,\" answered Mrs. Medlock, \"you'll scarcely believe your eyes</p>\n<p>when you see him. That plain sour-faced child that's almost</p>\n<p>as bad as himself has just bewitched him. How she's</p>\n<p>done it there's no telling. The Lord knows she's nothing</p>\n<p>to look at and you scarcely ever hear her speak,</p>\n<p>but she did what none of us dare do. She</p>\n<p>just flew at him like a little cat last night,</p>",
        "<p>and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop screaming,</p>\n<p>and somehow she startled him so that he actually did</p>\n<p>stop, and this afternoon--well just come up and see, sir.</p>\n<p>It's past crediting.\"</p>\n<p>The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his</p>\n<p>patient's room was indeed rather astonishing to him. As Mrs.</p>\n<p>Medlock opened the door he heard laughing and chattering. Colin</p>",
        "<p>was on his sofa in his dressing-gown and he was</p>\n<p>sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in one</p>\n<p>of the garden books and talking to the plain child</p>\n<p>who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at</p>\n<p>all because her face was so glowing with enjoyment.</p>\n<p>\"Those long spires of blue ones--we'll have a lot of</p>\n<p>those,\" Colin was announcing. \"They're called Del-phin-iums.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Dickon says they're larkspurs made big and grand,\" cried Mistress</p>\n<p>Mary. \"There are clumps there already.\"</p>\n<p>Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped. Mary became quite</p>\n<p>still and Colin looked fretful.</p>\n<p>\"I am sorry to hear you were ill last night,</p>\n<p>my boy,\" Dr. Craven said a trifle nervously. He was</p>\n<p>rather a nervous man.</p>",
        "<p>\"I'm better now--much better,\" Colin answered, rather like a Rajah.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going out in my chair in a day or</p>\n<p>two if it is fine. I want some fresh air.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse</p>\n<p>and looked at him curiously.</p>\n<p>\"It must be a very fine day,\" he said, \"and</p>\n<p>you must be very careful not to tire yourself.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Fresh air won't tire me,\" said the young Rajah.</p>\n<p>As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman</p>\n<p>had shrieked aloud with rage and had insisted that fresh</p>\n<p>air would give him cold and kill him, it is</p>\n<p>not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhat</p>\n<p>startled.</p>\n<p>\"I thought you did not like fresh air,\" he said.</p>",
        "<p>\"I don't when I am by myself,\" replied the Rajah;</p>\n<p>\"but my cousin is going out with me.\"</p>\n<p>\"And the nurse, of course?\" suggested Dr. Craven.</p>\n<p>\"No, I will not have the nurse,\" so magnificently that</p>\n<p>Mary could not help remembering how the young native Prince</p>\n<p>had looked with his diamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck</p>\n<p>all over him and the great rubies on the small</p>",
        "<p>dark hand he had waved to command his servants to</p>\n<p>approach with salaams and receive his orders.</p>\n<p>\"My cousin knows how to take care of me. I</p>\n<p>am always better when she is with me. She made</p>\n<p>me better last night. A very strong boy I know</p>\n<p>will push my carriage.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed. If this tiresome hysterical boy</p>",
        "<p>should chance to get well he himself would lose all</p>\n<p>chance of inheriting Misselthwaite; but he was not an unscrupulous</p>\n<p>man, though he was a weak one, and he did</p>\n<p>not intend to let him run into actual danger.</p>\n<p>\"He must be a strong boy and a steady boy,\"</p>\n<p>he said. \"And I must know something about him. Who</p>\n<p>is he? What is his name?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"It's Dickon,\" Mary spoke up suddenly. She felt somehow that</p>\n<p>everybody who knew the moor must know Dickon. And she</p>\n<p>was right, too. She saw that in a moment Dr.</p>\n<p>Craven's serious face relaxed into a relieved smile.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Dickon,\" he said. \"If it is Dickon you will</p>\n<p>be safe enough. He's as strong as a moor pony,</p>\n<p>is Dickon.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"And he's trusty,\" said Mary. \"He's th' trustiest lad i'</p>\n<p>Yorkshire.\" She had been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she</p>\n<p>forgot herself.</p>\n<p>\"Did Dickon teach you that?\" asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.</p>\n<p>\"I'm learning it as if it was French,\" said Mary</p>\n<p>rather coldly. \"It's like a native dialect in India. Very</p>\n<p>clever people try to learn them. I like it and</p>",
        "<p>so does Colin.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, well,\" he said. \"If it amuses you perhaps it</p>\n<p>won't do you any harm. Did you take your bromide</p>\n<p>last night, Colin?\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" Colin answered. \"I wouldn't take it at first and</p>\n<p>after Mary made me quiet she talked me to sleep--in</p>\n<p>a low voice--about the spring creeping into a garden.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"That sounds soothing,\" said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever</p>\n<p>and glancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool</p>\n<p>and looking down silently at the carpet. \"You are evidently</p>\n<p>better, but you must remember--\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to remember,\" interrupted the Rajah, appearing again.</p>\n<p>\"When I lie by myself and remember I begin to</p>\n<p>have pains everywhere and I think of things that make</p>",
        "<p>me begin to scream because I hate them so. If</p>\n<p>there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget</p>\n<p>you were ill instead of remembering it I would have</p>\n<p>him brought here.\" And he waved a thin hand which</p>\n<p>ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings</p>\n<p>made of rubies. \"It is because my cousin makes me</p>\n<p>forget that she makes me better.\"</p>",
        "<p>Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after</p>\n<p>a \"tantrum\"; usually he was obliged to remain a very</p>\n<p>long time and do a great many things. This afternoon</p>\n<p>he did not give any medicine or leave any new</p>\n<p>orders and he was spared any disagreeable scenes. When he</p>\n<p>went down-stairs he looked very thoughtful and when he talked</p>\n<p>to Mrs. Medlock in the library she felt that he</p>",
        "<p>was a much puzzled man.</p>\n<p>\"Well, sir,\" she ventured, \"could you have believed it?\"</p>\n<p>\"It is certainly a new state of affairs,\" said the</p>\n<p>doctor. \"And there's no denying it is better than the</p>\n<p>old one.\"</p>\n<p>\"I believe Susan Sowerby's right--I do that,\" said Mrs. Medlock.</p>\n<p>\"I stopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite</p>",
        "<p>yesterday and had a bit of talk with her. And</p>\n<p>she says to me, 'Well, Sarah Ann, she mayn't be</p>\n<p>a good child, an' she mayn't be a pretty one,</p>\n<p>but she's a child, an' children needs children.' We went</p>\n<p>to school together, Susan Sowerby and me.\"</p>\n<p>\"She's the best sick nurse I know,\" said Dr. Craven.</p>\n<p>\"When I find her in a cottage I know the</p>",
        "<p>chances are that I shall save my patient.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock smiled. She was fond of Susan Sowerby.</p>\n<p>\"She's got a way with her, has Susan,\" she went</p>\n<p>on quite volubly. \"I've been thinking all morning of one</p>\n<p>thing she said yesterday. She says, 'Once when I was</p>\n<p>givin' th' children a bit of a preach after they'd</p>\n<p>been fightin' I ses to 'em all, \"When I was</p>",
        "<p>at school my jography told as th' world was shaped</p>\n<p>like a orange an' I found out before I was</p>\n<p>ten that th' whole orange doesn't belong to nobody. No</p>\n<p>one owns more than his bit of a quarter an'</p>\n<p>there's times it seems like there's not enow quarters to</p>\n<p>go round. But don't you--none o' you--think as you own</p>\n<p>th' whole orange or you'll find out you're mistaken, an'</p>",
        "<p>you won't find it out without hard knocks.\" What children</p>\n<p>learns from children,' she says, 'is that there's no sense</p>\n<p>in grabbin' at th' whole orange--peel an' all. If you</p>\n<p>do you'll likely not get even th' pips, an' them's</p>\n<p>too bitter to eat.'\"</p>\n<p>\"She's a shrewd woman,\" said Dr. Craven, putting on his</p>\n<p>coat.</p>",
        "<p>\"Well, she's got a way of saying things,\" ended Mrs.</p>\n<p>Medlock, much pleased. \"Sometimes I've said to her, 'Eh! Susan,</p>\n<p>if you was a different woman an' didn't talk such</p>\n<p>broad Yorkshire I've seen the times when I should have</p>\n<p>said you was clever.'\"</p>\n<p>* * * * *</p>\n<p>That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he</p>",
        "<p>opened his eyes in the morning he lay still and</p>\n<p>smiled without knowing it--smiled because he felt so curiously comfortable.</p>\n<p>It was actually nice to be awake, and he turned</p>\n<p>over and stretched his limbs luxuriously. He felt as if</p>\n<p>tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and</p>\n<p>let him go. He did not know that Dr. Craven</p>\n<p>would have said that his nerves had relaxed and rested</p>",
        "<p>themselves. Instead of lying and staring at the wall and</p>\n<p>wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full of</p>\n<p>the plans he and Mary had made yesterday, of pictures</p>\n<p>of the garden and of Dickon and his wild creatures.</p>\n<p>It was so nice to have things to think about.</p>\n<p>And he had not been awake more than ten minutes</p>\n<p>when he heard feet running along the corridor and Mary</p>",
        "<p>was at the door. The next minute she was in</p>\n<p>the room and had run across to his bed, bringing</p>\n<p>with her a waft of fresh air full of the</p>\n<p>scent of the morning.</p>\n<p>\"You've been out! You've been out! There's that nice smell</p>\n<p>of leaves!\" he cried.</p>\n<p>She had been running and her hair was loose and</p>",
        "<p>blown and she was bright with the air and pink-cheeked,</p>\n<p>though he could not see it.</p>\n<p>\"It's so beautiful!\" she said, a little breathless with her</p>\n<p>speed. \"You never saw anything so beautiful! It has _come_!</p>\n<p>I thought it had come that other morning, but it</p>\n<p>was only coming. It is here now! It has come,</p>\n<p>the Spring! Dickon says so!\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Has it?\" cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing</p>\n<p>about it he felt his heart beat. He actually sat</p>\n<p>up in bed.</p>\n<p>\"Open the window!\" he added, laughing half with joyful excitement</p>\n<p>and half at his own fancy. \"Perhaps we may hear</p>\n<p>golden trumpets!\"</p>\n<p>And though he laughed, Mary was at the window in</p>",
        "<p>a moment and in a moment more it was opened</p>\n<p>wide and freshness and softness and scents and birds' songs</p>\n<p>were pouring through.</p>\n<p>\"That's fresh air,\" she said. \"Lie on your back and</p>\n<p>draw in long breaths of it. That's what Dickon does</p>\n<p>when he's lying on the moor. He says he feels</p>\n<p>it in his veins and it makes him strong and</p>",
        "<p>he feels as if he could live forever and ever.</p>\n<p>Breathe it and breathe it.\"</p>\n<p>She was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but</p>\n<p>she caught Colin's fancy.</p>\n<p>\"'Forever and ever'! Does it make him feel like that?\"</p>\n<p>he said, and he did as she told him, drawing</p>\n<p>in long deep breaths over and over again until he</p>",
        "<p>felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>Mary was at his bedside again.</p>\n<p>\"Things are crowding up out of the earth,\" she ran</p>\n<p>on in a hurry. \"And there are flowers uncurling and</p>\n<p>buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly</p>\n<p>all the gray and the birds are in such a</p>",
        "<p>hurry about their nests for fear they may be too</p>\n<p>late that some of them are even fighting for places</p>\n<p>in the secret garden. And the rose-bushes look as wick</p>\n<p>as wick can be, and there are primroses in the</p>\n<p>lanes and woods, and the seeds we planted are up,</p>\n<p>and Dickon has brought the fox and the crow and</p>\n<p>the squirrels and a new-born lamb.\"</p>",
        "<p>And then she paused for breath. The new-born lamb Dickon</p>\n<p>had found three days before lying by its dead mother</p>\n<p>among the gorse bushes on the moor. It was not</p>\n<p>the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew</p>\n<p>what to do with it. He had taken it to</p>\n<p>the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he had let</p>\n<p>it lie near the fire and had fed it with</p>",
        "<p>warm milk. It was a soft thing with a darling</p>\n<p>silly baby face and legs rather long for its body.</p>\n<p>Dickon had carried it over the moor in his arms</p>\n<p>and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a</p>\n<p>squirrel, and when Mary had sat under a tree with</p>\n<p>its limp warmness huddled on her lap she had felt</p>\n<p>as if she were too full of strange joy to</p>",
        "<p>speak. A lamb--a lamb! A living lamb who lay on</p>\n<p>your lap like a baby!</p>\n<p>She was describing it with great joy and Colin was</p>\n<p>listening and drawing in long breaths of air when the</p>\n<p>nurse entered. She started a little at the sight of</p>\n<p>the open window. She had sat stifling in the room</p>\n<p>many a warm day because her patient was sure that</p>",
        "<p>open windows gave people cold.</p>\n<p>\"Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?\" she</p>\n<p>inquired.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" was the answer. \"I am breathing long breaths of</p>\n<p>fresh air. It makes you strong. I am going to</p>\n<p>get up to the sofa for breakfast and my cousin</p>\n<p>will have breakfast with me.\"</p>",
        "<p>The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the</p>\n<p>order for two breakfasts. She found the servants' hall a</p>\n<p>more amusing place than the invalid's chamber and just now</p>\n<p>everybody wanted to hear the news from up-stairs. There was</p>\n<p>a great deal of joking about the unpopular young recluse</p>\n<p>who, as the cook said, \"had found his master, and</p>\n<p>good for him.\" The servants' hall had been very tired</p>",
        "<p>of the tantrums, and the butler, who was a man</p>\n<p>with a family, had more than once expressed his opinion</p>\n<p>that the invalid would be all the better \"for a</p>\n<p>good hiding.\"</p>\n<p>When Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for</p>\n<p>two was put upon the table he made an announcement</p>\n<p>to the nurse in his most Rajah-like manner.</p>",
        "<p>\"A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two</p>\n<p>squirrels, and a new-born lamb, are coming to see me</p>\n<p>this morning. I want them brought up-stairs as soon as</p>\n<p>they come,\" he said. \"You are not to begin playing</p>\n<p>with the animals in the servants' hall and keep them</p>\n<p>there. I want them here.\"</p>\n<p>The nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal</p>",
        "<p>it with a cough.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir,\" she answered.</p>\n<p>\"I'll tell you what you can do,\" added Colin, waving</p>\n<p>his hand. \"You can tell Martha to bring them here.</p>\n<p>The boy is Martha's brother. His name is Dickon and</p>\n<p>he is an animal charmer.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hope the animals won't bite, Master Colin,\" said the</p>",
        "<p>nurse.</p>\n<p>\"I told you he was a charmer,\" said Colin austerely.</p>\n<p>\"Charmers' animals never bite.\"</p>\n<p>\"There are snake-charmers in India,\" said Mary; \"and they can</p>\n<p>put their snakes' heads in their mouths.\"</p>\n<p>\"Goodness!\" shuddered the nurse.</p>\n<p>They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in</p>",
        "<p>upon them. Colin's breakfast was a very good one and</p>\n<p>Mary watched him with serious interest.</p>\n<p>\"You will begin to get fatter just as I did,\"</p>\n<p>she said. \"I never wanted my breakfast when I was</p>\n<p>in India and now I always want it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wanted mine this morning,\" said Colin. \"Perhaps it was</p>\n<p>the fresh air. When do you think Dickon will come?\"</p>",
        "<p>He was not long in coming. In about ten minutes</p>\n<p>Mary held up her hand.</p>\n<p>\"Listen!\" she said. \"Did you hear a caw?\"</p>\n<p>Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the</p>\n<p>world to hear inside a house, a hoarse \"caw-caw.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" he answered.</p>\n<p>\"That's Soot,\" said Mary. \"Listen again! Do you hear a</p>",
        "<p>bleat--a tiny one?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yes!\" cried Colin, quite flushing.</p>\n<p>\"That's the new-born lamb,\" said Mary. \"He's coming.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon's moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he</p>\n<p>tried to walk quietly they made a clumping sound as</p>\n<p>he walked through the long corridors. Mary and Colin heard</p>\n<p>him marching--marching, until he passed through the tapestry door on</p>",
        "<p>to the soft carpet of Colin's own passage.</p>\n<p>\"If you please, sir,\" announced Martha, opening the door, \"if</p>\n<p>you please, sir, here's Dickon an' his creatures.\"</p>\n<p>[Illustration: \"DICKON CAME IN SMILING HIS NICEST WIDE SMILE.\"--_Page 251_]</p>\n<p>Dickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile. The new-born</p>\n<p>lamb was in his arms and the little red fox</p>\n<p>trotted by his side. Nut sat on his left shoulder</p>",
        "<p>and Soot on his right and Shell's head and paws</p>\n<p>peeped out of his coat pocket.</p>\n<p>Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared--as he had</p>\n<p>stared when he first saw Mary; but this was a</p>\n<p>stare of wonder and delight. The truth was that in</p>\n<p>spite of all he had heard he had not in</p>\n<p>the least understood what this boy would be like and</p>",
        "<p>that his fox and his crow and his squirrels and</p>\n<p>his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness</p>\n<p>that they seemed almost to be part of himself. Colin</p>\n<p>had never talked to a boy in his life and</p>\n<p>he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure and curiosity</p>\n<p>that he did not even think of speaking.</p>\n<p>But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward.</p>",
        "<p>He had not felt embarrassed because the crow had not</p>\n<p>known his language and had only stared and had not</p>\n<p>spoken to him the first time they met. Creatures were</p>\n<p>always like that until they found out about you. He</p>\n<p>walked over to Colin's sofa and put the new-born lamb</p>\n<p>quietly on his lap, and immediately the little creature turned</p>\n<p>to the warm velvet dressing-gown and began to nuzzle and</p>",
        "<p>nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curled head with</p>\n<p>soft impatience against his side. Of course no boy could</p>\n<p>have helped speaking then.</p>\n<p>\"What is it doing?\" cried Colin. \"What does it want?\"</p>\n<p>\"It wants its mother,\" said Dickon, smiling more and more.</p>\n<p>\"I brought it to thee a bit hungry because I</p>\n<p>knowed tha'd like to see it feed.\"</p>",
        "<p>He knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle</p>\n<p>from his pocket.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, little 'un,\" he said, turning the small woolly</p>\n<p>white head with a gentle brown hand. \"This is what</p>\n<p>tha's after. Tha'll get more out o' this than tha'</p>\n<p>will out o' silk velvet coats. There now,\" and he</p>\n<p>pushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling</p>",
        "<p>mouth and the lamb began to suck it with ravenous</p>\n<p>ecstasy.</p>\n<p>After that there was no wondering what to say. By</p>\n<p>the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and</p>\n<p>Dickon answered them all. He told them how he had</p>\n<p>found the lamb just as the sun was rising three</p>\n<p>mornings ago. He had been standing on the moor listening</p>",
        "<p>to a skylark and watching him swing higher and higher</p>\n<p>into the sky until he was only a speck in</p>\n<p>the heights of blue.</p>\n<p>\"I'd almost lost him but for his song an' I</p>\n<p>was wonderin' how a chap could hear it when it</p>\n<p>seemed as if he'd get out o' th' world in</p>\n<p>a minute--an' just then I heard somethin' else far off</p>",
        "<p>among th' gorse bushes. It was a weak bleatin' an'</p>\n<p>I knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry</p>\n<p>an' I knowed it wouldn't be hungry if it hadn't</p>\n<p>lost its mother somehow, so I set off searchin'. Eh!</p>\n<p>I did have a look for it. I went in</p>\n<p>an' out among th' gorse bushes an' round an' round</p>\n<p>an' I always seemed to take th' wrong turnin'. But</p>",
        "<p>at last I seed a bit o' white by a</p>\n<p>rock on top o' th' moor an' I climbed up</p>\n<p>an' found th' little 'un half dead wi' cold an'</p>\n<p>clemmin'.\"</p>\n<p>While he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of</p>\n<p>the open window and cawed remarks about the scenery while</p>\n<p>Nut and Shell made excursions into the big trees outside</p>",
        "<p>and ran up and down trunks and explored branches. Captain</p>\n<p>curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug from</p>\n<p>preference.</p>\n<p>They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and</p>\n<p>Dickon knew all the flowers by their country names and</p>\n<p>knew exactly which ones were already growing in the secret</p>\n<p>garden.</p>",
        "<p>\"I couldna' say that there name,\" he said, pointing to</p>\n<p>one under which was written \"Aquilegia,\" \"but us calls that</p>\n<p>a columbine, an' that there one it's a snapdragon and</p>\n<p>they both grow wild in hedges, but these is garden</p>\n<p>ones an' they're bigger an' grander. There's some big clumps</p>\n<p>o' columbine in th' garden. They'll look like a bed</p>\n<p>o' blue an' white butterflies flutterin' when they're out.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I'm going to see them,\" cried Colin. \"I am going</p>\n<p>to see them!\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that tha' mun,\" said Mary quite seriously. \"An tha'</p>\n<p>munnot lose no time about it.\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>\n<p>\"I SHALL LIVE FOREVER--AND EVER--AND EVER!\"</p>\n<p>But they were obliged to wait more than a week</p>\n<p>because first there came some very windy days and then</p>\n<p>Colin was threatened with a cold, which two things happening</p>\n<p>one after the other would no doubt have thrown him</p>\n<p>into a rage but that there was so much careful</p>\n<p>and mysterious planning to do and almost every day Dickon</p>",
        "<p>came in, if only for a few minutes, to talk</p>\n<p>about what was happening on the moor and in the</p>\n<p>lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams. The</p>\n<p>things he had to tell about otters' and badgers' and</p>\n<p>water-rats' houses, not to mention birds' nests and field-mice and</p>\n<p>their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremble with</p>\n<p>excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an</p>",
        "<p>animal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety</p>\n<p>the whole busy underworld was working.</p>\n<p>\"They're same as us,\" said Dickon, \"only they have to</p>\n<p>build their homes every year. An' it keeps 'em so</p>\n<p>busy they fair scuffle to get 'em done.\"</p>\n<p>The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be</p>\n<p>made before Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to</p>",
        "<p>the garden. No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon</p>\n<p>and Mary after they turned a certain corner of the</p>\n<p>shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls.</p>\n<p>As each day passed, Colin had become more and more</p>\n<p>fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden</p>\n<p>was one of its greatest charms. Nothing must spoil that.</p>\n<p>No one must ever suspect that they had a secret.</p>",
        "<p>People must think that he was simply going out with</p>\n<p>Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not</p>\n<p>object to their looking at him. They had long and</p>\n<p>quite delightful talks about their route. They would go up</p>\n<p>this path and down that one and cross the other</p>\n<p>and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they</p>\n<p>were looking at the \"bedding-out plants\" the head gardener, Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Roach, had been having arranged. That would seem such a</p>\n<p>rational thing to do that no one would think it</p>\n<p>at all mysterious. They would turn into the shrubbery walks</p>\n<p>and lose themselves until they came to the long walls.</p>\n<p>It was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as</p>\n<p>the plans of march made by great generals in time</p>\n<p>of war.</p>",
        "<p>Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring</p>\n<p>in the invalid's apartments had of course filtered through the</p>\n<p>servants' hall into the stable yards and out among the</p>\n<p>gardeners, but notwithstanding this, Mr. Roach was startled one day</p>\n<p>when he received orders from Master Colin's room to the</p>\n<p>effect that he must report himself in the apartment no</p>\n<p>outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to</p>",
        "<p>speak to him.</p>\n<p>\"Well, well,\" he said to himself as he hurriedly changed</p>\n<p>his coat, \"what's to do now? His Royal Highness that</p>\n<p>wasn't to be looked at calling up a man he's</p>\n<p>never set eyes on.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught</p>\n<p>even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a</p>",
        "<p>dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny looks and ways and</p>\n<p>his insane tempers. The thing he had heard oftenest was</p>\n<p>that he might die at any moment and there had</p>\n<p>been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless</p>\n<p>limbs, given by people who had never seen him.</p>\n<p>\"Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,\" said Mrs.</p>\n<p>Medlock, as she led him up the back staircase to</p>",
        "<p>the corridor on to which opened the hitherto mysterious chamber.</p>\n<p>\"Let's hope they're changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,\" he</p>\n<p>answered.</p>\n<p>\"They couldn't well change for the worse,\" she continued; \"and</p>\n<p>queer as it all is there's them as finds their</p>\n<p>duties made a lot easier to stand up under. Don't</p>\n<p>you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in</p>",
        "<p>the middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby's Dickon more</p>\n<p>at home than you or me could ever be.\"</p>\n<p>There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as</p>\n<p>Mary always privately believed. When Mr. Roach heard his name</p>\n<p>he smiled quite leniently.</p>\n<p>\"He'd be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the</p>\n<p>bottom of a coal mine,\" he said. \"And yet it's</p>",
        "<p>not impudence, either. He's just fine, is that lad.\"</p>\n<p>It was perhaps well he had been prepared or he</p>\n<p>might have been startled. When the bedroom door was opened</p>\n<p>a large crow, which seemed quite at home perched on</p>\n<p>the high back of a carven chair, announced the entrance</p>\n<p>of a visitor by saying \"Caw--Caw\" quite loudly. In spite</p>\n<p>of Mrs. Medlock's warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being</p>",
        "<p>sufficiently undignified to jump backward.</p>\n<p>The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his</p>\n<p>sofa. He was sitting in an armchair and a young</p>\n<p>lamb was standing by him shaking its tail in feeding-lamb</p>\n<p>fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle.</p>\n<p>A squirrel was perched on Dickon's bent back attentively nibbling</p>\n<p>a nut. The little girl from India was sitting on</p>",
        "<p>a big footstool looking on.</p>\n<p>\"Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,\" said Mrs. Medlock.</p>\n<p>The young Rajah turned and looked his servitor over--at least</p>\n<p>that was what the head gardener felt happened.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you are Roach, are you?\" he said. \"I sent</p>\n<p>for you to give you some very important orders.\"</p>\n<p>\"Very good, sir,\" answered Roach, wondering if he was to</p>",
        "<p>receive instructions to fell all the oaks in the park</p>\n<p>or to transform the orchards into water-gardens.</p>\n<p>\"I am going out in my chair this afternoon,\" said</p>\n<p>Colin. \"If the fresh air agrees with me I may</p>\n<p>go out every day. When I go, none of the</p>\n<p>gardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by</p>\n<p>the garden walls. No one is to be there. I</p>",
        "<p>shall go out about two o'clock and every one must</p>\n<p>keep away until I send word that they may go</p>\n<p>back to their work.\"</p>\n<p>\"Very good, sir,\" replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear</p>\n<p>that the oaks might remain and that the orchards were</p>\n<p>safe.</p>\n<p>\"Mary,\" said Colin, turning to her, \"what is that thing</p>",
        "<p>you say in India when you have finished talking and</p>\n<p>want people to go?\"</p>\n<p>\"You say, 'You have my permission to go,'\" answered Mary.</p>\n<p>The Rajah waved his hand.</p>\n<p>\"You have my permission to go, Roach,\" he said. \"But,</p>\n<p>remember, this is very important.\"</p>\n<p>\"Caw--Caw!\" remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely.</p>",
        "<p>\"Very good, sir. Thank you, sir,\" said Mr. Roach, and</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock took him out of the room.</p>\n<p>Outside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he</p>\n<p>smiled until he almost laughed.</p>\n<p>\"My word!\" he said, \"he's got a fine lordly way</p>\n<p>with him, hasn't he? You'd think he was a whole</p>\n<p>Royal Family rolled into one--Prince Consort and all.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Eh!\" protested Mrs. Medlock, \"we've had to let him trample</p>\n<p>all over every one of us ever since he had</p>\n<p>feet and he thinks that's what folks was born for.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps he'll grow out of it, if he lives,\" suggested</p>\n<p>Mr. Roach.</p>\n<p>\"Well, there's one thing pretty sure,\" said Mrs. Medlock. \"If</p>\n<p>he does live and that Indian child stays here I'll</p>",
        "<p>warrant she teaches him that the whole orange does not</p>\n<p>belong to him, as Susan Sowerby says. And he'll be</p>\n<p>likely to find out the size of his own quarter.\"</p>\n<p>Inside the room Colin was leaning back on his cushions.</p>\n<p>\"It's all safe now,\" he said. \"And this afternoon I</p>\n<p>shall see it--this afternoon I shall be in it!\"</p>\n<p>Dickon went back to the garden with his creatures and</p>",
        "<p>Mary stayed with Colin. She did not think he looked</p>\n<p>tired but he was very quiet before their lunch came</p>\n<p>and he was quiet while they were eating it. She</p>\n<p>wondered why and asked him about it.</p>\n<p>\"What big eyes you've got, Colin,\" she said. \"When you</p>\n<p>are thinking they get as big as saucers. What are</p>\n<p>you thinking about now?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I can't help thinking about what it will look like,\"</p>\n<p>he answered.</p>\n<p>\"The garden?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"The springtime,\" he said. \"I was thinking that I've really</p>\n<p>never seen it before. I scarcely ever went out and</p>\n<p>when I did go I never looked at it. I</p>\n<p>didn't even think about it.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I never saw it in India because there wasn't any,\"</p>\n<p>said Mary.</p>\n<p>Shut in and morbid as his life had been, Colin</p>\n<p>had more imagination than she had and at least he</p>\n<p>had spent a good deal of time looking at wonderful</p>\n<p>books and pictures.</p>\n<p>\"That morning when you ran in and said 'It's come!</p>",
        "<p>It's come!' you made me feel quite queer. It sounded</p>\n<p>as if things were coming with a great procession and</p>\n<p>big bursts and wafts of music. I've a picture like</p>\n<p>it in one of my books--crowds of lovely people and</p>\n<p>children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them, every</p>\n<p>one laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes.</p>\n<p>That was why I said, 'Perhaps we shall hear golden</p>",
        "<p>trumpets' and told you to throw open the window.\"</p>\n<p>\"How funny!\" said Mary. \"That's really just what it feels</p>\n<p>like. And if all the flowers and leaves and green</p>\n<p>things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once,</p>\n<p>what a crowd it would be! I'm sure they'd dance</p>\n<p>and sing and flute and that would be the wafts</p>\n<p>of music.\"</p>",
        "<p>They both laughed but it was not because the idea</p>\n<p>was laughable but because they both so liked it.</p>\n<p>A little later the nurse made Colin ready. She noticed</p>\n<p>that instead of lying like a log while his clothes</p>\n<p>were put on he sat up and made some efforts</p>\n<p>to help himself, and he talked and laughed with Mary</p>\n<p>all the time.</p>",
        "<p>\"This is one of his good days, sir,\" she said</p>\n<p>to Dr. Craven, who dropped in to inspect him. \"He's</p>\n<p>in such good spirits that it makes him stronger.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll call in again later in the afternoon, after he</p>\n<p>has come in,\" said Dr. Craven. \"I must see how</p>\n<p>the going out agrees with him. I wish,\" in a</p>\n<p>very low voice, \"that he would let you go with</p>",
        "<p>him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd rather give up the case this moment, sir, than</p>\n<p>even stay here while it's suggested,\" answered the nurse with</p>\n<p>sudden firmness.</p>\n<p>\"I hadn't really decided to suggest it,\" said the doctor,</p>\n<p>with his slight nervousness. \"We'll try the experiment. Dickon's a</p>\n<p>lad I'd trust with a new-born child.\"</p>",
        "<p>The strongest footman in the house carried Colin down-stairs and</p>\n<p>put him in his wheeled chair near which Dickon waited</p>\n<p>outside. After the manservant had arranged his rugs and cushions</p>\n<p>the Rajah waved his hand to him and to the</p>\n<p>nurse.</p>\n<p>\"You have my permission to go,\" he said, and they</p>\n<p>both disappeared quickly and it must be confessed giggled when</p>",
        "<p>they were safely inside the house.</p>\n<p>Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily.</p>\n<p>Mistress Mary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and</p>\n<p>lifted his face to the sky. The arch of it</p>\n<p>looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like</p>\n<p>white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness.</p>\n<p>The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the</p>",
        "<p>moor and was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness.</p>\n<p>Colin kept lifting his thin chest to draw it in,</p>\n<p>and his big eyes looked as if it were they</p>\n<p>which were listening--listening, instead of his ears.</p>\n<p>\"There are so many sounds of singing and humming and</p>\n<p>calling out,\" he said. \"What is that scent the puffs</p>\n<p>of wind bring?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"It's gorse on th' moor that's openin' out,\" answered Dickon.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! th' bees are at it wonderful to-day.\"</p>\n<p>Not a human creature was to be caught sight of</p>\n<p>in the paths they took. In fact every gardener or</p>\n<p>gardener's lad had been witched away. But they wound in</p>\n<p>and out among the shrubbery and out and round the</p>\n<p>fountain beds, following their carefully planned route for the mere</p>",
        "<p>mysterious pleasure of it. But when at last they turned</p>\n<p>into the Long Walk by the ivied walls the excited</p>\n<p>sense of an approaching thrill made them, for some curious</p>\n<p>reason they could not have explained, begin to speak in</p>\n<p>whispers.</p>\n<p>\"This is it,\" breathed Mary. \"This is where I used</p>\n<p>to walk up and down and wonder and wonder.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Is it?\" cried Colin, and his eyes began to search</p>\n<p>the ivy with eager curiousness. \"But I can see nothing,\"</p>\n<p>he whispered. \"There is no door.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's what I thought,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>Then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair</p>\n<p>wheeled on.</p>\n<p>\"That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,\" said Mary.</p>",
        "<p>\"Is it?\" said Colin.</p>\n<p>A few yards more and Mary whispered again.</p>\n<p>\"This is where the robin flew over the wall,\" she</p>\n<p>said.</p>\n<p>\"Is it?\" cried Colin. \"Oh! I wish he'd come again!\"</p>\n<p>\"And that,\" said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a</p>\n<p>big lilac bush, \"is where he perched on the little</p>",
        "<p>heap of earth and showed me the key.\"</p>\n<p>Then Colin sat up.</p>\n<p>\"Where? Where? There?\" he cried, and his eyes were as</p>\n<p>big as the wolf's in Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood</p>\n<p>felt called upon to remark on them. Dickon stood still</p>\n<p>and the wheeled chair stopped.</p>\n<p>\"And this,\" said Mary, stepping on to the bed close</p>",
        "<p>to the ivy, \"is where I went to talk to</p>\n<p>him when he chirped at me from the top of</p>\n<p>the wall. And this is the ivy the wind blew</p>\n<p>back,\" and she took hold of the hanging green curtain.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! is it--is it!\" gasped Colin.</p>\n<p>\"And here is the handle, and here is the door.</p>\n<p>Dickon push him in--push him in quickly!\"</p>",
        "<p>And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.</p>\n<p>But Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even</p>\n<p>though he gasped with delight, and he had covered his</p>\n<p>eyes with his hands and held them there shutting out</p>\n<p>everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as</p>\n<p>if by magic and the door was closed. Not till</p>\n<p>then did he take them away and look round and</p>",
        "<p>round and round as Dickon and Mary had done. And</p>\n<p>over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and</p>\n<p>tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had</p>\n<p>crept, and in the grass under the trees and the</p>\n<p>gray urns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere</p>\n<p>were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white</p>\n<p>and the trees were showing pink and snow above his</p>",
        "<p>head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet</p>\n<p>pipes and humming and scents and scents. And the sun</p>\n<p>fell warm upon his face like a hand with a</p>\n<p>lovely touch. And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and</p>\n<p>stared at him. He looked so strange and different because</p>\n<p>a pink glow of color had actually crept all over</p>\n<p>him--ivory face and neck and hands and all.</p>",
        "<p>\"I shall get well! I shall get well!\" he cried</p>\n<p>out. \"Mary! Dickon! I shall get well! And I shall</p>\n<p>live forever and ever and ever!\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>\n<p>BEN WEATHERSTAFF</p>\n<p>One of the strange things about living in the world</p>\n<p>is that it is only now and then one is</p>\n<p>quite sure one is going to live forever and ever</p>\n<p>and ever.

Perhaps out of pure</p>\n<p>heavenly goodness the spring came and crowded everything it possibly</p>",
        "<p>could into that one place. More than once Dickon paused</p>\n<p>in what he was doing and stood still with a</p>\n<p>sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head</p>\n<p>softly.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! it is graidely,\" he said. \"I'm twelve goin' on</p>\n<p>thirteen an' there's a lot o' afternoons in thirteen years,</p>\n<p>but seems to me like I never seed one as</p>",
        "<p>graidely as this 'ere.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, it is a graidely one,\" said Mary, and she</p>\n<p>sighed for mere joy. \"I'll warrant it's th' graidelest one</p>\n<p>as ever was in this world.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does tha' think,\" said Colin with dreamy carefulness, \"as happen</p>\n<p>it was made loike this 'ere all o' purpose for</p>\n<p>me?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"My word!\" cried Mary admiringly, \"that there is a bit</p>\n<p>o' good Yorkshire. Tha'rt shapin' first-rate--that tha' art.\"</p>\n<p>And delight reigned.</p>\n<p>They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white</p>\n<p>with blossoms and musical with bees. It was like a</p>\n<p>king's canopy, a fairy king's. There were flowering cherry-trees near</p>\n<p>and apple-trees whose buds were pink and white, and here</p>",
        "<p>and there one had burst open wide. Between the blossoming</p>\n<p>branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down</p>\n<p>like wonderful eyes.</p>\n<p>Mary and Dickon worked a little here and there and</p>\n<p>Colin watched them. They brought him things to look at--buds</p>\n<p>which were opening, buds which were tight closed, bits of</p>\n<p>twig whose leaves were just showing green, the feather of</p>",
        "<p>a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty</p>\n<p>shell of some bird early hatched. Dickon pushed the chair</p>\n<p>slowly round and round the garden, stopping every other moment</p>\n<p>to let him look at wonders springing out of the</p>\n<p>earth or trailing down from trees. It was like being</p>\n<p>taken in state round the country of a magic king</p>\n<p>and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained.</p>",
        "<p>\"I wonder if we shall see the robin?\" said Colin.</p>\n<p>\"Tha'll see him often enow after a bit,\" answered Dickon.</p>\n<p>\"When th' eggs hatches out th' little chap he'll be</p>\n<p>kep' so busy it'll make his head swim. Tha'll see</p>\n<p>him flyin' backward an' for'ard carryin' worms nigh as big</p>\n<p>as himsel' an' that much noise goin' on in th'</p>\n<p>nest when he gets there as fair flusters him so</p>",
        "<p>as he scarce knows which big mouth to drop th'</p>\n<p>first piece in. An' gapin' beaks an' squawks on every</p>\n<p>side. Mother says as when she sees th' work a</p>\n<p>robin has to keep them gapin' beaks filled, she feels</p>\n<p>like she was a lady with nothin' to do. She</p>\n<p>says she's seen th' little chaps when it seemed like</p>\n<p>th' sweat must be droppin' off 'em, though folk can't</p>",
        "<p>see it.\"</p>\n<p>This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged</p>\n<p>to cover their mouths with their hands, remembering that they</p>\n<p>must not be heard. Colin had been instructed as to</p>\n<p>the law of whispers and low voices several days before.</p>\n<p>He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best,</p>\n<p>but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather</p>",
        "<p>difficult never to laugh above a whisper.</p>\n<p>Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things</p>\n<p>and every hour the sunshine grew more golden. The wheeled</p>\n<p>chair had been drawn back under the canopy and Dickon</p>\n<p>had sat down on the grass and had just drawn</p>\n<p>out his pipe when Colin saw something he had not</p>\n<p>had time to notice before.</p>",
        "<p>\"That's a very old tree over there, isn't it?\" he</p>\n<p>said.</p>\n<p>Dickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary</p>\n<p>looked and there was a brief moment of stillness.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice had</p>\n<p>a very gentle sound.</p>\n<p>Mary gazed at the tree and thought.</p>",
        "<p>\"The branches are quite gray and there's not a single</p>\n<p>leaf anywhere,\" Colin went on. \"It's quite dead, isn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye,\" admitted Dickon. \"But them roses as has climbed all</p>\n<p>over it will near hide every bit o' th' dead</p>\n<p>wood when they're full o' leaves an' flowers. It won't</p>\n<p>look dead then. It'll be th' prettiest of all.\"</p>\n<p>Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.</p>",
        "<p>\"It looks as if a big branch had been broken</p>\n<p>off,\" said Colin. \"I wonder how it was done.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's been done many a year,\" answered Dickon. \"Eh!\" with</p>\n<p>a sudden relieved start and laying his hand on Colin.</p>\n<p>\"Look at that robin! There he is! He's been foragin'</p>\n<p>for his mate.\"</p>\n<p>Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight</p>",
        "<p>of him, the flash of red-breasted bird with something in</p>\n<p>his beak. He darted through the greenness and into the</p>\n<p>close-grown corner and was out of sight. Colin leaned back</p>\n<p>on his cushion again, laughing a little.</p>\n<p>\"He's taking her tea to her. Perhaps it's five o'clock.</p>\n<p>I think I'd like some tea myself.\"</p>\n<p>And so they were safe.</p>",
        "<p>\"It was Magic which sent the robin,\" said Mary secretly</p>\n<p>to Dickon afterward. \"I know it was Magic.\" For both</p>\n<p>she and Dickon had been afraid Colin might ask something</p>\n<p>about the tree whose branch had broken off ten years</p>\n<p>ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon</p>\n<p>had stood and rubbed his head in a troubled way.</p>\n<p>\"We mun look as if it wasn't no different from</p>",
        "<p>th' other trees,\" he had said. \"We couldn't never tell</p>\n<p>him how it broke, poor lad. If he says anything</p>\n<p>about it we mun--we mun try to look cheerful.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that we mun,\" had answered Mary.</p>\n<p>But she had not felt as if she looked cheerful</p>\n<p>when she gazed at the tree. She wondered and wondered</p>\n<p>in those few moments if there was any reality in</p>",
        "<p>that other thing Dickon had said. He had gone on</p>\n<p>rubbing his rust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a</p>\n<p>nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue</p>\n<p>eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,\" he had</p>\n<p>gone on rather hesitatingly. \"An' mother she thinks maybe she's</p>\n<p>about Misselthwaite many a time lookin' after Mester Colin, same</p>",
        "<p>as all mothers do when they're took out o' th'</p>\n<p>world. They have to come back, tha' sees. Happen she's</p>\n<p>been in the garden an' happen it was her set</p>\n<p>us to work, an' told us to bring him here.\"</p>\n<p>Mary had thought he meant something about Magic. She was</p>\n<p>a great believer in Magic. Secretly she quite believed that</p>\n<p>Dickon worked Magic, of course good Magic, on everything near</p>",
        "<p>him and that was why people liked him so much</p>\n<p>and wild creatures knew he was their friend. She wondered,</p>\n<p>indeed, if it were not possible that his gift had</p>\n<p>brought the robin just at the right moment when Colin</p>\n<p>asked that dangerous question. She felt that his Magic was</p>\n<p>working all the afternoon and making Colin look like an</p>\n<p>entirely different boy. It did not seem possible that he</p>",
        "<p>could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten</p>\n<p>and bitten his pillow. Even his ivory whiteness seemed to</p>\n<p>change. The faint glow of color which had shown on</p>\n<p>his face and neck and hands when he first got</p>\n<p>inside the garden really never quite died away. He looked</p>\n<p>as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory</p>\n<p>or wax.</p>",
        "<p>They saw the robin carry food to his mate two</p>\n<p>or three times, and it was so suggestive of afternoon</p>\n<p>tea that Colin felt they must have some.</p>\n<p>\"Go and make one of the men servants bring some</p>\n<p>in a basket to the rhododendron walk,\" he said. \"And</p>\n<p>then you and Dickon can bring it here.\"</p>\n<p>It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when</p>",
        "<p>the white cloth was spread upon the grass, with hot</p>\n<p>tea and buttered toast and crumpets, a delightfully hungry meal</p>\n<p>was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands paused to</p>\n<p>inquire what was going on and were led into investigating</p>\n<p>crumbs with great activity. Nut and Shell whisked up trees</p>\n<p>with pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half</p>\n<p>of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at</p>",
        "<p>and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks</p>\n<p>about it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully</p>\n<p>in one gulp.</p>\n<p>The afternoon was dragging toward its mellow hour. The sun</p>\n<p>was deepening the gold of its lances, the bees were</p>\n<p>going home and the birds were flying past less often.</p>\n<p>Dickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, the tea-basket</p>",
        "<p>was re-packed ready to be taken back to the house,</p>\n<p>and Colin was lying against his cushions with his heavy</p>\n<p>locks pushed back from his forehead and his face looking</p>\n<p>quite a natural color.</p>\n<p>\"I don't want this afternoon to go,\" he said; \"but</p>\n<p>I shall come back to-morrow, and the day after, and</p>\n<p>the day after, and the day after.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"You'll get plenty of fresh air, won't you?\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to get nothing else,\" he answered. \"I've seen</p>\n<p>the spring now and I'm going to see the summer.</p>\n<p>I'm going to see everything grow here. I'm going to</p>\n<p>grow here myself.\"</p>\n<p>\"That tha' will,\" said Dickon. \"Us'll have thee walkin' about</p>\n<p>here an' diggin' same as other folk afore long.\"</p>",
        "<p>Colin flushed tremendously.</p>\n<p>\"Walk!\" he said. \"Dig! Shall I?\"</p>\n<p>Dickon's glance at him was delicately cautious. Neither he nor</p>\n<p>Mary had ever asked if anything was the matter with</p>\n<p>his legs.</p>\n<p>\"For sure tha' will,\" he said stoutly. \"Tha'--tha's got legs</p>\n<p>o' thine own, same as other folks!\"</p>",
        "<p>Mary was rather frightened until she heard Colin's answer.</p>\n<p>\"Nothing really ails them,\" he said, \"but they are so</p>\n<p>thin and weak. They shake so that I'm afraid to</p>\n<p>try to stand on them.\"</p>\n<p>Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.</p>\n<p>\"When tha' stops bein' afraid tha'lt stand on 'em,\" Dickon</p>\n<p>said with renewed cheer. \"An' tha'lt stop bein' afraid in</p>",
        "<p>a bit.\"</p>\n<p>\"I shall?\" said Colin, and he lay still as if</p>\n<p>he were wondering about things.</p>\n<p>They were really very quiet for a little while. The</p>\n<p>sun was dropping lower. It was that hour when everything</p>\n<p>stills itself, and they really had had a busy and</p>\n<p>exciting afternoon. Colin looked as if he were resting luxuriously.</p>",
        "<p>Even the creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn</p>\n<p>together and were resting near them. Soot had perched on</p>\n<p>a low branch and drawn up one leg and dropped</p>\n<p>the gray film drowsily over his eyes. Mary privately thought</p>\n<p>he looked as if he might snore in a minute.</p>\n<p>In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling</p>\n<p>when Colin half lifted his head and exclaimed in a</p>",
        "<p>loud suddenly alarmed whisper:</p>\n<p>\"Who is that man?\"</p>\n<p>Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.</p>\n<p>\"Man!\" they both cried in low quick voices.</p>\n<p>Colin pointed to the high wall.</p>\n<p>\"Look!\" he whispered excitedly. \"Just look!\"</p>\n<p>Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked. There was Ben</p>",
        "<p>Weatherstaff's indignant face glaring at them over the wall from</p>\n<p>the top of a ladder! He actually shook his fist</p>\n<p>at Mary.</p>\n<p>\"If I wasn't a bachelder, an' tha' was a wench</p>\n<p>o' mine,\" he cried, \"I'd give thee a hidin'!\"</p>\n<p>He mounted another step threateningly as if it were his</p>\n<p>energetic intention to jump down and deal with her; but</p>",
        "<p>as she came toward him he evidently thought better of</p>\n<p>it and stood on the top step of his ladder</p>\n<p>shaking his fist down at her.</p>\n<p>\"I never thowt much o' thee!\" he harangued. \"I couldna'</p>\n<p>abide thee th' first time I set eyes on thee.</p>\n<p>A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom, allus askin' questions an' pokin'</p>\n<p>tha' nose where it wasna' wanted. I never knowed how</p>",
        "<p>tha' got so thick wi' me. If it hadna' been</p>\n<p>for th' robin--Drat him--\"</p>\n<p>\"Ben Weatherstaff,\" called out Mary, finding her breath. She stood</p>\n<p>below him and called up to him with a sort</p>\n<p>of gasp. \"Ben Weatherstaff, it was the robin who showed</p>\n<p>me the way!\"</p>\n<p>Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble</p>",
        "<p>down on her side of the wall, he was so</p>\n<p>outraged.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' young bad 'un!\" he called down at her. \"Layin'</p>\n<p>tha' badness on a robin,--not but what he's impidint enow</p>\n<p>for anythin'. Him showin' thee th' way! Him! Eh! tha'</p>\n<p>young nowt,\"--she could see his next words burst out because</p>\n<p>he was overpowered by curiosity--\"however i' this world did tha'</p>",
        "<p>get in?\"</p>\n<p>\"It was the robin who showed me the way,\" she</p>\n<p>protested obstinately. \"He didn't know he was doing it but</p>\n<p>he did. And I can't tell you from here while</p>\n<p>you're shaking your fist at me.\"</p>\n<p>He stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very</p>\n<p>moment and his jaw actually dropped as he stared over</p>",
        "<p>her head at something he saw coming over the grass</p>\n<p>toward him.</p>\n<p>At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin</p>\n<p>had been so surprised that he had only sat up</p>\n<p>and listened as if he were spellbound. But in the</p>\n<p>midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously</p>\n<p>to Dickon.</p>",
        "<p>\"Wheel me over there!\" he commanded. \"Wheel me quite close</p>\n<p>and stop right in front of him!\"</p>\n<p>And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff</p>\n<p>beheld and which made his jaw drop. A wheeled chair</p>\n<p>with luxurious cushions and robes which came toward him looking</p>\n<p>rather like some sort of State Coach because a young</p>\n<p>Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his</p>",
        "<p>great black-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily</p>\n<p>toward him. And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff's nose.</p>\n<p>It was really no wonder his mouth dropped open.</p>\n<p>\"Do you know who I am?\" demanded the Rajah.</p>\n<p>How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves</p>\n<p>on what was before him as if he were seeing</p>\n<p>a ghost. He gazed and gazed and gulped a lump</p>",
        "<p>down his throat and did not say a word.</p>\n<p>\"Do you know who I am?\" demanded Colin still more</p>\n<p>imperiously. \"Answer!\"</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it</p>\n<p>over his eyes and over his forehead and then he</p>\n<p>did answer in a queer shaky voice.</p>\n<p>\"Who tha' art?\" he said. \"Aye, that I do--wi' tha'</p>",
        "<p>mother's eyes starin' at me out o' tha' face. Lord</p>\n<p>knows how tha' come here. But tha'rt th' poor cripple.\"</p>\n<p>Colin forgot that he had ever had a back. His</p>\n<p>face flushed scarlet and he sat bolt upright.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not a cripple!\" he cried out furiously. \"I'm not!\"</p>\n<p>\"He's not!\" cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in</p>\n<p>her fierce indignation. \"He's not got a lump as big</p>",
        "<p>as a pin! I looked and there was none there--not</p>\n<p>one!\"</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again and</p>\n<p>gazed as if he could never gaze enough. His hand</p>\n<p>shook and his mouth shook and his voice shook. He</p>\n<p>was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man</p>\n<p>and he could only remember the things he had heard.</p>",
        "<p>\"Tha'--tha' hasn't got a crooked back?\" he said hoarsely.</p>\n<p>\"No!\" shouted Colin.</p>\n<p>\"Tha'--tha' hasn't got crooked legs?\" quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.</p>\n<p>It was too much. The strength which Colin usually threw</p>\n<p>into his tantrums rushed through him now in a new</p>\n<p>way. Never yet had he been accused of crooked legs--even</p>\n<p>in whispers--and the perfectly simple belief in their existence which</p>",
        "<p>was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff's voice was more than Rajah</p>\n<p>flesh and blood could endure. His anger and insulted pride</p>\n<p>made him forget everything but this one moment and filled</p>\n<p>him with a power he had never known before, an</p>\n<p>almost unnatural strength.</p>\n<p>\"Come here!\" he shouted to Dickon, and he actually began</p>\n<p>to tear the coverings off his lower limbs and disentangle</p>",
        "<p>himself. \"Come here! Come here! This minute!\"</p>\n<p>Dickon was by his side in a second. Mary caught</p>\n<p>her breath in a short gasp and felt herself turn</p>\n<p>pale.</p>\n<p>\"He can do it! He can do it! He can</p>\n<p>do it! He can!\" she gabbled over to herself under</p>\n<p>her breath as fast as ever she could.</p>",
        "<p>There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed</p>\n<p>on to the ground, Dickon held Colin's arm, the thin</p>\n<p>legs were out, the thin feet were on the grass.</p>\n<p>Colin was standing upright--upright--as straight as an arrow and looking</p>\n<p>strangely tall--his head thrown back and his strange eyes flashing</p>\n<p>lightning.</p>\n<p>\"Look at me!\" he flung up at Ben Weatherstaff. \"Just</p>",
        "<p>look at me--you! Just look at me!\"</p>\n<p>\"He's as straight as I am!\" cried Dickon. \"He's as</p>\n<p>straight as any lad i' Yorkshire!\"</p>\n<p>What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure. He</p>\n<p>choked and gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather-wrinkled</p>\n<p>cheeks as he struck his old hands together.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" he burst forth, \"th' lies folk tells! Tha'rt as</p>",
        "<p>thin as a lath an' as white as a wraith,</p>\n<p>but there's not a knob on thee. Tha'lt make a</p>\n<p>mon yet. God bless thee!\"</p>\n<p>Dickon held Colin's arm strongly but the boy had not</p>\n<p>begun to falter. He stood straighter and straighter and looked</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff in the face.</p>\n<p>\"I'm your master,\" he said, \"when my father is away.</p>",
        "<p>And you are to obey me. This is my garden.</p>\n<p>Don't dare to say a word about it! You get</p>\n<p>down from that ladder and go out to the Long</p>\n<p>Walk and Miss Mary will meet you and bring you</p>\n<p>here. I want to talk to you. We did not</p>\n<p>want you, but now you will have to be in</p>\n<p>the secret. Be quick!\"</p>",
        "<p>Ben Weatherstaff's crabbed old face was still wet with that</p>\n<p>one queer rush of tears. It seemed as if he</p>\n<p>could not take his eyes from thin straight Colin standing</p>\n<p>on his feet with his head thrown back.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! lad,\" he almost whispered. \"Eh! my lad!\" And then</p>\n<p>remembering himself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and</p>\n<p>said, \"Yes, sir! Yes, sir!\" and obediently disappeared as he</p>",
        "<p>descended the ladder.</p>"

        "<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>\n<p>WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN</p>\n<p>When his head was out of sight Colin turned to</p>\n<p>Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Go and meet him,\" he said; and Mary flew across</p>\n<p>the grass to the door under the ivy.</p>\n<p>Dickon was watching him with sharp eyes. There were scarlet</p>\n<p>spots on his cheeks and he looked amazing, but he</p>",
        "<p>showed no signs of falling.</p>\n<p>\"I can stand,\" he said, and his head was still</p>\n<p>held up and he said it quite grandly.</p>\n<p>\"I told thee tha' could as soon as tha' stopped</p>\n<p>bein' afraid,\" answered Dickon. \"An' tha's stopped.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I've stopped,\" said Colin.</p>\n<p>Then suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.</p>",
        "<p>\"Are you making Magic?\" he asked sharply.</p>\n<p>Dickon's curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.</p>\n<p>\"Tha's doin' Magic thysel',\" he said. \"It's same Magic as</p>\n<p>made these 'ere work out o' th' earth,\" and he</p>\n<p>touched with his thick boot a clump of crocuses in</p>\n<p>the grass.</p>\n<p>Colin looked down at them.</p>",
        "<p>\"Aye,\" he said slowly, \"there couldna' be bigger Magic then</p>\n<p>that there--there couldna' be.\"</p>\n<p>He drew himself up straighter than ever.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to walk to that tree,\" he said, pointing</p>\n<p>to one a few feet away from him. \"I'm going</p>\n<p>to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here. I can rest</p>\n<p>against the tree if I like. When I want to</p>",
        "<p>sit down I will sit down, but not before. Bring</p>\n<p>a rug from the chair.\"</p>\n<p>He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his</p>\n<p>arm he was wonderfully steady. When he stood against the</p>\n<p>tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported</p>\n<p>himself against it, and he still held himself so straight</p>\n<p>that he looked tall.</p>",
        "<p>When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall</p>\n<p>he saw him standing there and he heard Mary muttering</p>\n<p>something under her breath.</p>\n<p>\"What art sayin'?\" he asked rather testily because he did</p>\n<p>not want his attention distracted from the long thin straight</p>\n<p>boy figure and proud face.</p>\n<p>But she did not tell him. What she was saying</p>",
        "<p>was this:</p>\n<p>\"You can do it! You can do it! I told</p>\n<p>you you could! You can do it! You can do</p>\n<p>it! You _can_!\"</p>\n<p>She was saying it to Colin because she wanted to</p>\n<p>make Magic and keep him on his feet looking like</p>\n<p>that. She could not bear that he should give in</p>",
        "<p>before Ben Weatherstaff. He did not give in. She was</p>\n<p>uplifted by a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful</p>\n<p>in spite of his thinness. He fixed his eyes on</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious way.</p>\n<p>\"Look at me!\" he commanded. \"Look at me all over!</p>\n<p>Am I a hunchback? Have I got crooked legs?\"</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but</p>",
        "<p>he had recovered a little and answered almost in his</p>\n<p>usual way.</p>\n<p>\"Not tha',\" he said. \"Nowt o' th' sort. What's tha'</p>\n<p>been doin' with thysel'--? hidin' out o' sight an' lettin'</p>\n<p>folk think tha' was cripple an' half-witted?\"</p>\n<p>\"Half-witted!\" said Colin angrily. \"Who thought that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Lots o' fools,\" said Ben. \"Th' world's full o' jackasses</p>",
        "<p>brayin' an' they never bray nowt but lies. What did</p>\n<p>tha' shut thysel' up for?\"</p>\n<p>\"Every one thought I was going to die,\" said Colin</p>\n<p>shortly. \"I'm not!\"</p>\n<p>And he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked</p>\n<p>him over, up and down, down and up.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' die!\" he said with dry exultation. \"Nowt o' th'</p>",
        "<p>sort! Tha's got too much pluck in thee. When I</p>\n<p>seed thee put tha' legs on th' ground in such</p>\n<p>a hurry I knowed tha' was all right. Sit thee</p>\n<p>down on th' rug a bit young Mester an' give</p>\n<p>me thy orders.\"</p>\n<p>There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd</p>\n<p>understanding in his manner. Mary had poured out speech as</p>",
        "<p>rapidly as she could as they had come down the</p>\n<p>Long Walk. The chief thing to be remembered, she had</p>\n<p>told him, was that Colin was getting well--getting well. The</p>\n<p>garden was doing it. No one must let him remember</p>\n<p>about having humps and dying.</p>\n<p>The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under</p>\n<p>the tree.</p>",
        "<p>\"What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?\" he</p>\n<p>inquired.</p>\n<p>\"Anythin' I'm told to do,\" answered old Ben. \"I'm kep'</p>\n<p>on by favor--because she liked me.\"</p>\n<p>\"She?\" said Colin.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' mother,\" answered Ben Weatherstaff.</p>\n<p>\"My mother?\" said Colin, and he looked about him quietly.</p>",
        "<p>\"This was her garden, wasn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, it was that!\" and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him</p>\n<p>too. \"She were main fond of it.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is my garden now, I am fond of it.</p>\n<p>I shall come here every day,\" announced Colin. \"But it</p>\n<p>is to be a secret. My orders are that no</p>\n<p>one is to know that we come here. Dickon and</p>",
        "<p>my cousin have worked and made it come alive. I</p>\n<p>shall send for you sometimes to help--but you must come</p>\n<p>when no one can see you.\"</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff's face twisted itself in a dry old smile.</p>\n<p>\"I've come here before when no one saw me,\" he</p>\n<p>said.</p>\n<p>\"What!\" exclaimed Colin. \"When?\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Th' last time I was here,\" rubbing his chin and</p>\n<p>looking round, \"was about two year' ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"But no one has been in it for ten years!\"</p>\n<p>cried Colin. \"There was no door!\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm no one,\" said old Ben dryly. \"An' I didn't</p>\n<p>come through th' door. I come over th' wall. Th'</p>\n<p>rheumatics held me back th' last two year'.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Tha' come an' did a bit o' prunin'!\" cried Dickon.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't make out how it had been done.\"</p>\n<p>\"She was so fond of it--she was!\" said Ben Weatherstaff</p>\n<p>slowly. \"An' she was such a pretty young thing. She</p>\n<p>says to me once, 'Ben,' says she laughin', 'if ever</p>\n<p>I'm ill or if I go away you must take</p>\n<p>care of my roses.' When she did go away th'</p>",
        "<p>orders was no one was ever to come nigh. But</p>\n<p>I come,\" with grumpy obstinacy. \"Over th' wall I come--until</p>\n<p>th' rheumatics stopped me--an' I did a bit o' work</p>\n<p>once a year. She'd gave her order first.\"</p>\n<p>\"It wouldn't have been as wick as it is if</p>\n<p>tha' hadn't done it,\" said Dickon. \"I did wonder.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad you did it, Weatherstaff,\" said Colin. \"You'll know</p>",
        "<p>how to keep the secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, I'll know, sir,\" answered Ben. \"An' it'll be easier</p>\n<p>for a man wi' rheumatics to come in at th'</p>\n<p>door.\"</p>\n<p>On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her</p>\n<p>trowel. Colin stretched out his hand and took it up.</p>\n<p>An odd expression came into his face and he began</p>",
        "<p>to scratch at the earth. His thin hand was weak</p>\n<p>enough but presently as they watched him--Mary with quite breathless</p>\n<p>interest--he drove the end of the trowel into the soil</p>\n<p>and turned some over.</p>\n<p>\"You can do it! You can do it!\" said Mary</p>\n<p>to herself. \"I tell you, you can!\"</p>\n<p>Dickon's round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he</p>",
        "<p>said not a word. Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested</p>\n<p>face.</p>\n<p>Colin persevered. After he had turned a few trowelfuls of</p>\n<p>soil he spoke exultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' said as tha'd have me walkin' about here same</p>\n<p>as other folk--an' tha' said tha'd have me diggin'. I</p>\n<p>thowt tha' was just leein' to please me. This is</p>",
        "<p>only th' first day an' I've walked--an' here I am</p>\n<p>diggin'.\"</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff's mouth fell open again when he heard him,</p>\n<p>but he ended by chuckling.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" he said, \"that sounds as if tha'd got wits</p>\n<p>enow. Tha'rt a Yorkshire lad for sure. An' tha'rt diggin',</p>\n<p>too. How'd tha' like to plant a bit o' somethin'?</p>",
        "<p>I can get thee a rose in a pot.\"</p>\n<p>\"Go and get it!\" said Colin, digging excitedly. \"Quick! Quick!\"</p>\n<p>It was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his</p>\n<p>way forgetting rheumatics. Dickon took his spade and dug the</p>\n<p>hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin</p>\n<p>white hands could make it. Mary slipped out to run</p>\n<p>and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon had deepened the</p>",
        "<p>hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and</p>\n<p>over. He looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing</p>\n<p>with the strangely new exercise, slight as it was.</p>\n<p>\"I want to do it before the sun goes quite--quite</p>\n<p>down,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few</p>\n<p>minutes just on purpose. Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in</p>",
        "<p>its pot from the greenhouse. He hobbled over the grass</p>\n<p>as fast as he could. He had begun to be</p>\n<p>excited, too. He knelt down by the hole and broke</p>\n<p>the pot from the mould.</p>\n<p>\"Here, lad,\" he said, handing the plant to Colin. \"Set</p>\n<p>it in the earth thysel' same as th' king does</p>\n<p>when he goes to a new place.\"</p>",
        "<p>The thin white hands shook a little and Colin's flush</p>\n<p>grew deeper as he set the rose in the mould</p>\n<p>and held it while old Ben made firm the earth.</p>\n<p>It was filled in and pressed down and made steady.</p>\n<p>Mary was leaning forward on her hands and knees. Soot</p>\n<p>had flown down and marched forward to see what was</p>\n<p>being done. Nut and Shell chattered about it from a</p>",
        "<p>cherry-tree.</p>\n<p>\"It's planted!\" said Colin at last. \"And the sun is</p>\n<p>only slipping over the edge. Help me up, Dickon. I</p>\n<p>want to be standing when it goes. That's part of</p>\n<p>the Magic.\"</p>\n<p>And Dickon helped him, and the Magic--or whatever it was--so</p>\n<p>gave him strength that when the sun did slip over</p>",
        "<p>the edge and end the strange lovely afternoon for them</p>\n<p>there he actually stood on his two feet--laughing.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>\n<p>MAGIC</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house</p>\n<p>when they returned to it. He had indeed begun to</p>\n<p>wonder if it might not be wise to send some</p>\n<p>one out to explore the garden paths. When Colin was</p>\n<p>brought back to his room the poor man looked him</p>\n<p>over seriously.</p>",
        "<p>\"You should not have stayed so long,\" he said. \"You</p>\n<p>must not overexert yourself.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am not tired at all,\" said Colin. \"It has</p>\n<p>made me well. To-morrow I am going out in the</p>\n<p>morning as well as in the afternoon.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am not sure that I can allow it,\" answered</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven. \"I am afraid it would not be wise.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"It would not be wise to try to stop me,\"</p>\n<p>said Colin quite seriously. \"I am going.\"</p>\n<p>Even Mary had found out that one of Colin's chief</p>\n<p>peculiarities was that he did not know in the least</p>\n<p>what a rude little brute he was with his way</p>\n<p>of ordering people about. He had lived on a sort</p>\n<p>of desert island all his life and as he had</p>",
        "<p>been the king of it he had made his own</p>\n<p>manners and had had no one to compare himself with.</p>\n<p>Mary had indeed been rather like him herself and since</p>\n<p>she had been at Misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her</p>\n<p>own manners had not been of the kind which is</p>\n<p>usual or popular. Having made this discovery she naturally thought</p>\n<p>it of enough interest to communicate to Colin. So she</p>",
        "<p>sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes</p>\n<p>after Dr. Craven had gone. She wanted to make him</p>\n<p>ask her why she was doing it and of course</p>\n<p>she did.</p>\n<p>\"What are you looking at me for?\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I'm thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.\"</p>\n<p>\"So am I,\" said Colin calmly, but not without an</p>",
        "<p>air of some satisfaction. \"He won't get Misselthwaite at all</p>\n<p>now I'm not going to die.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry for him because of that, of course,\" said</p>\n<p>Mary, \"but I was thinking just then that it must</p>\n<p>have been very horrid to have had to be polite</p>\n<p>for ten years to a boy who was always rude.</p>\n<p>I would never have done it.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Am I rude?\" Colin inquired undisturbedly.</p>\n<p>\"If you had been his own boy and he had</p>\n<p>been a slapping sort of man,\" said Mary, \"he would</p>\n<p>have slapped you.\"</p>\n<p>\"But he daren't,\" said Colin.</p>\n<p>\"No, he daren't,\" answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out</p>\n<p>quite without prejudice. \"Nobody ever dared to do anything you</p>",
        "<p>didn't like--because you were going to die and things like</p>\n<p>that. You were such a poor thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"But,\" announced Colin stubbornly, \"I am not going to be</p>\n<p>a poor thing. I won't let people think I'm one.</p>\n<p>I stood on my feet this afternoon.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is always having your own way that has made</p>\n<p>you so queer,\" Mary went on, thinking aloud.</p>",
        "<p>Colin turned his head, frowning.</p>\n<p>\"Am I queer?\" he demanded.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Mary, \"very. But you needn't be cross,\" she</p>\n<p>added impartially, \"because so am I queer--and so is Ben</p>\n<p>Weatherstaff. But I am not as queer as I was</p>\n<p>before I began to like people and before I found</p>\n<p>the garden.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I don't want to be queer,\" said Colin. \"I am</p>\n<p>not going to be,\" and he frowned again with determination.</p>\n<p>He was a very proud boy. He lay thinking for</p>\n<p>a while and then Mary saw his beautiful smile begin</p>\n<p>and gradually change his whole face.</p>\n<p>\"I shall stop being queer,\" he said, \"if I go</p>\n<p>every day to the garden. There is Magic in there--good</p>",
        "<p>Magic, you know, Mary. I am sure there is.\"</p>\n<p>\"So am I,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Even if it isn't real Magic,\" Colin said, \"we can</p>\n<p>pretend it is. _Something_ is there--_something_!\"</p>\n<p>\"It's Magic,\" said Mary, \"but not black. It's as white</p>\n<p>as snow.\"</p>\n<p>They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like</p>",
        "<p>it in the months that followed--the wonderful months--the radiant months--the</p>\n<p>amazing ones. Oh! the things which happened in that garden!</p>\n<p>If you have never had a garden, you cannot understand,</p>\n<p>and if you have had a garden you will know</p>\n<p>that it would take a whole book to describe all</p>\n<p>that came to pass there. At first it seemed that</p>\n<p>green things would never cease pushing their way through the</p>",
        "<p>earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the</p>\n<p>crevices of the walls. Then the green things began to</p>\n<p>show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show</p>\n<p>color, every shade of blue, every shade of purple, every</p>\n<p>tint and hue of crimson. In its happy days flowers</p>\n<p>had been tucked away into every inch and hole and</p>\n<p>corner. Ben Weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself</p>",
        "<p>scraped out mortar from between the bricks of the wall</p>\n<p>and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things to</p>\n<p>grow on. Iris and white lilies rose out of the</p>\n<p>grass in sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with</p>\n<p>amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of</p>\n<p>tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas.</p>\n<p>\"She was main fond o' them--she was,\" Ben Weatherstaff said.</p>",
        "<p>\"She liked them things as was allus pointin' up to</p>\n<p>th' blue sky, she used to tell. Not as she</p>\n<p>was one o' them as looked down on th' earth--not</p>\n<p>her. She just loved it but she said as th'</p>\n<p>blue sky allus looked so joyful.\"</p>\n<p>The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if</p>\n<p>fairies had tended them. Satiny poppies of all tints danced</p>",
        "<p>in the breeze by the score, gaily defying flowers which</p>\n<p>had lived in the garden for years and which it</p>\n<p>might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new</p>\n<p>people had got there. And the roses--the roses! Rising out</p>\n<p>of the grass, tangled round the sun-dial, wreathing the tree</p>\n<p>trunks and hanging from their branches, climbing up the walls</p>\n<p>and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades--they</p>",
        "<p>came alive day by day, hour by hour. Fair fresh</p>\n<p>leaves, and buds--and buds--tiny at first but swelling and working</p>\n<p>Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent</p>\n<p>delicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden</p>\n<p>air.</p>\n<p>Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took</p>\n<p>place. Every morning he was brought out and every hour</p>",
        "<p>of each day when it didn't rain he spent in</p>\n<p>the garden. Even gray days pleased him. He would lie</p>\n<p>on the grass \"watching things growing,\" he said. If you</p>\n<p>watched long enough, he declared, you could see buds unsheath</p>\n<p>themselves. Also you could make the acquaintance of strange busy</p>\n<p>insect things running about on various unknown but evidently serious</p>\n<p>errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather or</p>",
        "<p>food, or climbing blades of grass as if they were</p>\n<p>trees from whose tops one could look out to explore</p>\n<p>the country. A mole throwing up its mound at the</p>\n<p>end of its burrow and making its way out at</p>\n<p>last with the long-nailed paws which looked so like elfish</p>\n<p>hands, had absorbed him one whole morning. Ants' ways, beetles'</p>\n<p>ways, bees' ways, frogs' ways, birds' ways, plants' ways, gave</p>",
        "<p>him a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed</p>\n<p>them all and added foxes' ways, otters' ways, ferrets' ways,</p>\n<p>squirrels' ways, and trout's and water-rats' and badgers' ways, there</p>\n<p>was no end to the things to talk about and</p>\n<p>think over.</p>\n<p>And this was not the half of the Magic. The</p>\n<p>fact that he had really once stood on his feet</p>",
        "<p>had set Colin thinking tremendously and when Mary told him</p>\n<p>of the spell she had worked he was excited and</p>\n<p>approved of it greatly. He talked of it constantly.</p>\n<p>\"Of course there must be lots of Magic in the</p>\n<p>world,\" he said wisely one day, \"but people don't know</p>\n<p>what it is like or how to make it. Perhaps</p>\n<p>the beginning is just to say nice things are going</p>",
        "<p>to happen until you make them happen. I am going</p>\n<p>to try and experiment.\"</p>\n<p>The next morning when they went to the secret garden</p>\n<p>he sent at once for Ben Weatherstaff. Ben came as</p>\n<p>quickly as he could and found the Rajah standing on</p>\n<p>his feet under a tree and looking very grand but</p>\n<p>also very beautifully smiling.</p>",
        "<p>\"Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,\" he said. \"I want you and</p>\n<p>Dickon and Miss Mary to stand in a row and</p>\n<p>listen to me because I am going to tell you</p>\n<p>something very important.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, aye, sir!\" answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead. (One</p>\n<p>of the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that</p>\n<p>in his boyhood he had once run away to sea</p>",
        "<p>and had made voyages. So he could reply like a</p>\n<p>sailor.)</p>\n<p>\"I am going to try a scientific experiment,\" explained the</p>\n<p>Rajah. \"When I grow up I am going to make</p>\n<p>great scientific discoveries and I am going to begin now</p>\n<p>with this experiment.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, aye, sir!\" said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was</p>",
        "<p>the first time he had heard of great scientific discoveries.</p>\n<p>It was the first time Mary had heard of them,</p>\n<p>either, but even at this stage she had begun to</p>\n<p>realize that, queer as he was, Colin had read about</p>\n<p>a great many singular things and was somehow a very</p>\n<p>convincing sort of boy. When he held up his head</p>\n<p>and fixed his strange eyes on you it seemed as</p>",
        "<p>if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though</p>\n<p>he was only ten years old--going on eleven. At this</p>\n<p>moment he was especially convincing because he suddenly felt the</p>\n<p>fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a</p>\n<p>grown-up person.</p>\n<p>\"The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,\" he</p>\n<p>went on, \"will be about Magic. Magic is a great</p>",
        "<p>thing and scarcely any one knows anything about it except</p>\n<p>a few people in old books--and Mary a little, because</p>\n<p>she was born in India where there are fakirs. I</p>\n<p>believe Dickon knows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn't know</p>\n<p>he knows it. He charms animals and people. I would</p>\n<p>never have let him come to see me if he</p>\n<p>had not been an animal charmer--which is a boy charmer,</p>",
        "<p>too, because a boy is an animal. I am sure</p>\n<p>there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense</p>\n<p>enough to get hold of it and make it do</p>\n<p>things for us--like electricity and horses and steam.\"</p>\n<p>This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited</p>\n<p>and really could not keep still.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, aye, sir,\" he said and he began to stand</p>",
        "<p>up quite straight.</p>\n<p>\"When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,\" the</p>\n<p>orator proceeded. \"Then something began pushing things up out of</p>\n<p>the soil and making things out of nothing. One day</p>\n<p>things weren't there and another they were. I had never</p>\n<p>watched things before and it made me feel very curious.</p>\n<p>Scientific people are always curious and I am going to</p>",
        "<p>be scientific. I keep saying to myself, 'What is it?</p>\n<p>What is it?' It's something. It can't be nothing! I</p>\n<p>don't know its name so I call it Magic. I</p>\n<p>have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon</p>\n<p>have and from what they tell me I am sure</p>\n<p>that is Magic too. Something pushes it up and draws</p>\n<p>it. Sometimes since I've been in the garden I've looked</p>",
        "<p>up through the trees at the sky and I have</p>\n<p>had a strange feeling of being happy as if something</p>\n<p>were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me</p>\n<p>breathe fast. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making</p>\n<p>things out of nothing. Everything is made out of Magic,</p>\n<p>leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and</p>\n<p>squirrels and people. So it must be all around us.</p>",
        "<p>In this garden--in all the places. The Magic in this</p>\n<p>garden has made me stand up and know I am</p>\n<p>going to live to be a man. I am going</p>\n<p>to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some</p>\n<p>and put it in myself and make it push and</p>\n<p>draw me and make me strong. I don't know how</p>\n<p>to do it but I think that if you keep</p>",
        "<p>thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come.</p>\n<p>Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it.</p>\n<p>When I was going to try to stand that first</p>\n<p>time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as she</p>\n<p>could, 'You can do it! You can do it!' and</p>\n<p>I did. I had to try myself at the same</p>\n<p>time, of course, but her Magic helped me--and so did</p>",
        "<p>Dickon's. Every morning and evening and as often in the</p>\n<p>daytime as I can remember I am going to say,</p>\n<p>'Magic is in me! Magic is making me well! I</p>\n<p>am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong</p>\n<p>as Dickon!' And you must all do it, too. That</p>\n<p>is my experiment. Will you help, Ben Weatherstaff?\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, aye, sir!\" said Ben Weatherstaff. \"Aye, aye!\"</p>",
        "<p>\"If you keep doing it every day as regularly as</p>\n<p>soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen</p>\n<p>and find out if the experiment succeeds. You learn things</p>\n<p>by saying them over and over and thinking about them</p>\n<p>until they stay in your mind forever and I think</p>\n<p>it will be the same with Magic. If you keep</p>\n<p>calling it to come to you and help you it</p>",
        "<p>will get to be part of you and it will</p>\n<p>stay and do things.\"</p>\n<p>\"I once heard an officer in India tell my mother</p>\n<p>that there were fakirs who said words over and over</p>\n<p>thousands of times,\" said Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I've heard Jem Fettleworth's wife say th' same thing over</p>\n<p>thousands o' times--callin' Jem a drunken brute,\" said Ben Weatherstaff</p>",
        "<p>dryly. \"Summat allus come o' that, sure enough. He gave</p>\n<p>her a good hidin' an' went to th' Blue Lion</p>\n<p>an' got as drunk as a lord.\"</p>\n<p>Colin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Then he cheered up.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" he said, \"you see something did come of it.</p>\n<p>She used the wrong Magic until she made him beat</p>",
        "<p>her. If she'd used the right Magic and had said</p>\n<p>something nice perhaps he wouldn't have got as drunk as</p>\n<p>a lord and perhaps--perhaps he might have bought her a</p>\n<p>new bonnet.\"</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his</p>\n<p>little old eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Tha'rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one,</p>",
        "<p>Mester Colin,\" he said. \"Next time I see Bess Fettleworth</p>\n<p>I'll give her a bit of a hint o' what</p>\n<p>Magic will do for her. She'd be rare an' pleased</p>\n<p>if th' sinetifik 'speriment worked--an' so 'ud Jem.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes</p>\n<p>shining with curious delight. Nut and Shell were on his</p>\n<p>shoulders and he held a long-eared white rabbit in his</p>",
        "<p>arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid</p>\n<p>its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.</p>\n<p>\"Do you think the experiment will work?\" Colin asked him,</p>\n<p>wondering what he was thinking. He so often wondered what</p>\n<p>Dickon was thinking when he saw him looking at him</p>\n<p>or at one of his \"creatures\" with his happy wide</p>\n<p>smile.</p>",
        "<p>He smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.</p>\n<p>\"Aye,\" he answered, \"that I do. It'll work same as</p>\n<p>th' seeds do when th' sun shines on 'em. It'll</p>\n<p>work for sure. Shall us begin it now?\"</p>\n<p>Colin was delighted and so was Mary. Fired by recollections</p>\n<p>of fakirs and devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they</p>\n<p>should all sit cross-legged under the tree which made a</p>",
        "<p>canopy.</p>\n<p>\"It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,\"</p>\n<p>said Colin. \"I'm rather tired and I want to sit</p>\n<p>down.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" said Dickon, \"tha' musn't begin by sayin' tha'rt tired.</p>\n<p>Tha' might spoil th' Magic.\"</p>\n<p>Colin turned and looked at him--into his innocent round eyes.</p>",
        "<p>\"That's true,\" he said slowly. \"I must only think of</p>\n<p>the Magic.\"</p>\n<p>It all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat</p>\n<p>down in their circle. Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he</p>\n<p>had somehow been led into appearing at a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily</p>\n<p>he was very fixed in being what he called \"agen'</p>\n<p>prayer-meetin's\" but this being the Rajah's affair he did not</p>",
        "<p>resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at</p>\n<p>being called upon to assist. Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured.</p>\n<p>Dickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he</p>\n<p>made some charmer's signal no one heard, for when he</p>\n<p>sat down, cross-legged like the rest, the crow, the fox,</p>\n<p>the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made</p>\n<p>part of the circle, settling each into a place of</p>",
        "<p>rest as if of their own desire.</p>\n<p>\"The 'creatures' have come,\" said Colin gravely. \"They want to</p>\n<p>help us.\"</p>\n<p>Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought. He held his</p>\n<p>head high as if he felt like a sort of</p>\n<p>priest and his strange eyes had a wonderful look in</p>\n<p>them. The light shone on him through the tree canopy.</p>",
        "<p>\"Now we will begin,\" he said. \"Shall we sway backward</p>\n<p>and forward, Mary, as if we were dervishes?\"</p>\n<p>\"I canna' do no swayin' back'ard and for'ard,\" said Ben</p>\n<p>Weatherstaff. \"I've got th' rheumatics.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Magic will take them away,\" said Colin in a</p>\n<p>High Priest tone, \"but we won't sway until it has</p>\n<p>done it. We will only chant.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I canna' do no chantin',\" said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle</p>\n<p>testily. \"They turned me out o' th' church choir th'</p>\n<p>only time I ever tried it.\"</p>\n<p>No one smiled. They were all too much in earnest.</p>\n<p>Colin's face was not even crossed by a shadow. He</p>\n<p>was thinking only of the Magic.</p>\n<p>\"Then I will chant,\" he said. And he began, looking</p>",
        "<p>like a strange boy spirit. \"The sun is shining--the sun</p>\n<p>is shining. That is the Magic. The flowers are growing--the</p>\n<p>roots are stirring. That is the Magic. Being alive is</p>\n<p>the Magic--being strong is the Magic. The Magic is in</p>\n<p>me--the Magic is in me. It is in me--it is</p>\n<p>in me. It's in every one of us. It's in</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff's back. Magic! Magic! Come and help!\"</p>",
        "<p>He said it a great many times--not a thousand times</p>\n<p>but quite a goodly number. Mary listened entranced. She felt</p>\n<p>as if it were at once queer and beautiful and</p>\n<p>she wanted him to go on and on. Ben Weatherstaff</p>\n<p>began to feel soothed into a sort of dream which</p>\n<p>was quite agreeable. The humming of the bees in the</p>\n<p>blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into</p>",
        "<p>a doze. Dickon sat cross-legged with his rabbit asleep on</p>\n<p>his arm and a hand resting on the lamb's back.</p>\n<p>Soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to</p>\n<p>him on his shoulder, the gray film dropped over his</p>\n<p>eyes. At last Colin stopped.</p>\n<p>\"Now I am going to walk round the garden,\" he</p>\n<p>announced.</p>",
        "<p>Ben Weatherstaff's head had just dropped forward and he lifted</p>\n<p>it with a jerk.</p>\n<p>\"You have been asleep,\" said Colin.</p>\n<p>\"Nowt o' th' sort,\" mumbled Ben. \"Th' sermon was good</p>\n<p>enow--but I'm bound to get out afore th' collection.\"</p>\n<p>He was not quite awake yet.</p>\n<p>\"You're not in church,\" said Colin.</p>",
        "<p>\"Not me,\" said Ben, straightening himself. \"Who said I were?</p>\n<p>I heard every bit of it. You said th' Magic</p>\n<p>was in my back. Th' doctor calls it rheumatics.\"</p>\n<p>The Rajah waved his hand.</p>\n<p>\"That was the wrong Magic,\" he said. \"You will get</p>\n<p>better. You have my permission to go to your work.</p>\n<p>But come back to-morrow.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I'd like to see thee walk round the garden,\" grunted</p>\n<p>Ben.</p>\n<p>It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a</p>\n<p>grunt. In fact, being a stubborn old party and not</p>\n<p>having entire faith in Magic he had made up his</p>\n<p>mind that if he were sent away he would climb</p>\n<p>his ladder and look over the wall so that he</p>",
        "<p>might be ready to hobble back if there were any</p>\n<p>stumbling.</p>\n<p>The Rajah did not object to his staying and so</p>\n<p>the procession was formed. It really did look like a</p>\n<p>procession. Colin was at its head with Dickon on one</p>\n<p>side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walked behind,</p>\n<p>and the \"creatures\" trailed after them, the lamb and the</p>",
        "<p>fox cub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping</p>\n<p>along or stopping to nibble and Soot following with the</p>\n<p>solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge.</p>\n<p>It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity.</p>\n<p>Every few yards it stopped to rest. Colin leaned on</p>\n<p>Dickon's arm and privately Ben Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout,</p>\n<p>but now and then Colin took his hand from its</p>",
        "<p>support and walked a few steps alone. His head was</p>\n<p>held up all the time and he looked very grand.</p>\n<p>\"The Magic is in me!\" he kept saying. \"The Magic</p>\n<p>is making me strong! I can feel it! I can</p>\n<p>feel it!\"</p>\n<p>It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting</p>\n<p>him. He sat on the seats in the alcoves, and</p>",
        "<p>once or twice he sat down on the grass and</p>\n<p>several times he paused in the path and leaned on</p>\n<p>Dickon, but he would not give up until he had</p>\n<p>gone all round the garden. When he returned to the</p>\n<p>canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked triumphant.</p>\n<p>\"I did it! The Magic worked!\" he cried. \"That is</p>\n<p>my first scientific discovery.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"What will Dr. Craven say?\" broke out Mary.</p>\n<p>\"He won't say anything,\" Colin answered, \"because he will not</p>\n<p>be told. This is to be the biggest secret of</p>\n<p>all. No one is to know anything about it until</p>\n<p>I have grown so strong that I can walk and</p>\n<p>run like any other boy. I shall come here every</p>\n<p>day in my chair and I shall be taken back</p>",
        "<p>in it. I won't have people whispering and asking questions</p>\n<p>and I won't let my father hear about it until</p>\n<p>the experiment has quite succeeded. Then sometime when he comes</p>\n<p>back to Misselthwaite I shall just walk into his study</p>\n<p>and say 'Here I am; I am like any other</p>\n<p>boy. I am quite well and I shall live to</p>\n<p>be a man. It has been done by a scientific</p>",
        "<p>experiment.'\"</p>\n<p>\"He will think he is in a dream,\" cried Mary.</p>\n<p>\"He won't believe his eyes.\"</p>\n<p>Colin flushed triumphantly. He had made himself believe that he</p>\n<p>was going to get well, which was really more than</p>\n<p>half the battle, if he had been aware of it.</p>\n<p>And the thought which stimulated him more than any other</p>",
        "<p>was this imagining what his father would look like when</p>\n<p>he saw that he had a son who was as</p>\n<p>straight and strong as other fathers' sons. One of his</p>\n<p>darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had been</p>\n<p>his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father</p>\n<p>was afraid to look at him.</p>\n<p>\"He'll be obliged to believe them,\" he said. \"One of</p>",
        "<p>the things I am going to do, after the Magic</p>\n<p>works and before I begin to make scientific discoveries, is</p>\n<p>to be an athlete.\"</p>\n<p>\"We shall have thee takin' to boxin' in a week</p>\n<p>or so,\" said Ben Weatherstaff. \"Tha'lt end wi' winnin' th'</p>\n<p>Belt an' bein' champion prize-fighter of all England.\"</p>\n<p>Colin fixed his eyes on him sternly.</p>",
        "<p>\"Weatherstaff,\" he said, \"that is disrespectful. You must not take</p>\n<p>liberties because you are in the secret. However much the</p>\n<p>Magic works I shall not be a prize-fighter. I shall</p>\n<p>be a Scientific Discoverer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ax pardon--ax pardon, sir,\" answered Ben, touching his forehead in</p>\n<p>salute. \"I ought to have seed it wasn't a jokin'</p>\n<p>matter,\" but his eyes twinkled and secretly he was immensely</p>",
        "<p>pleased. He really did not mind being snubbed since the</p>\n<p>snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strength and spirit.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>\n<p>\"LET THEM LAUGH\"</p>\n<p>The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked</p>\n<p>in. Round the cottage on the moor there was a</p>\n<p>piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough</p>\n<p>stones. Early in the morning and late in the fading</p>\n<p>twilight and on all the days Colin and Mary did</p>\n<p>not see him, Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes</p>",
        "<p>and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother.</p>\n<p>In the company of his \"creatures\" he did wonders there</p>\n<p>and was never tired of doing them, it seemed. While</p>\n<p>he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of</p>\n<p>Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain or</p>\n<p>the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.</p>\n<p>\"We'd never get on as comfortable as we do,\" Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Sowerby said, \"if it wasn't for Dickon's garden. Anything'll grow</p>\n<p>for him. His 'taters and cabbages is twice th' size</p>\n<p>of any one else's an' they've got a flavor with</p>\n<p>'em as nobody's has.\"</p>\n<p>When she found a moment to spare she liked to</p>\n<p>go out and talk to him. After supper there was</p>\n<p>still a long clear twilight to work in and that</p>",
        "<p>was her quiet time. She could sit upon the low</p>\n<p>rough wall and look on and hear stories of the</p>\n<p>day. She loved this time. There were not only vegetables</p>\n<p>in this garden. Dickon had bought penny packages of flower</p>\n<p>seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among</p>\n<p>gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of</p>\n<p>mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he</p>",
        "<p>could save year after year or whose roots would bloom</p>\n<p>each spring and spread in time into fine clumps. The</p>\n<p>low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire</p>\n<p>because he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress</p>\n<p>and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and</p>\n<p>there glimpses of the stones were to be seen.</p>\n<p>\"All a chap's got to do to make 'em thrive,</p>",
        "<p>mother,\" he would say, \"is to be friends with 'em</p>\n<p>for sure. They're just like th' 'creatures.' If they're thirsty</p>\n<p>give 'em a drink and if they're hungry give 'em</p>\n<p>a bit o' food. They want to live same as</p>\n<p>we do. If they died I should feel as if</p>\n<p>I'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.\"</p>\n<p>It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard</p>",
        "<p>of all that happened at Misselthwaite Manor. At first she</p>\n<p>was only told that \"Mester Colin\" had taken a fancy</p>\n<p>to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and</p>\n<p>that it was doing him good. But it was not</p>\n<p>long before it was agreed between the two children that</p>\n<p>Dickon's mother might \"come into the secret.\" Somehow it was</p>\n<p>not doubted that she was \"safe for sure.\"</p>",
        "<p>So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story,</p>\n<p>with all the thrilling details of the buried key and</p>\n<p>the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like</p>\n<p>deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to</p>\n<p>reveal. The coming of Dickon and how it had been</p>\n<p>told to him, the doubt of Mester Colin and the</p>\n<p>final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain, combined</p>",
        "<p>with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's angry face peering over</p>\n<p>the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant strength, made Mrs.</p>\n<p>Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color several times.</p>\n<p>\"My word!\" she said. \"It was a good thing that</p>\n<p>little lass came to th' Manor. It's been th' makin'</p>\n<p>o' her an' th' savin' o' him. Standin' on his</p>\n<p>feet! An' us all thinkin' he was a poor half-witted</p>",
        "<p>lad with not a straight bone in him.\"</p>\n<p>She asked a great many questions and her blue eyes</p>\n<p>were full of deep thinking.</p>\n<p>\"What do they make of it at th' Manor--him being</p>\n<p>so well an' cheerful an' never complainin'?\" she inquired.</p>\n<p>\"They don't know what to make of it,\" answered Dickon.</p>\n<p>\"Every day as comes round his face looks different. It's</p>",
        "<p>fillin' out and doesn't look so sharp an' th' waxy</p>\n<p>color is goin'. But he has to do his bit</p>\n<p>o' complainin',\" with a highly entertained grin.</p>\n<p>\"What for, i' Mercy's name?\" asked Mrs. Sowerby.</p>\n<p>Dickon chuckled.</p>\n<p>\"He does it to keep them from guessin' what's happened.</p>\n<p>If the doctor knew he'd found out he could stand</p>",
        "<p>on his feet he'd likely write and tell Mester Craven.</p>\n<p>Mester Colin's savin' th' secret to tell himself. He's goin'</p>\n<p>to practise his Magic on his legs every day till</p>\n<p>his father comes back an' then he's goin' to march</p>\n<p>into his room an' show him he's as straight as</p>\n<p>other lads. But him an' Miss Mary thinks it's best</p>\n<p>plan to do a bit o' groanin' an' frettin' now</p>",
        "<p>an' then to throw folk off th' scent.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before</p>\n<p>he had finished his last sentence.</p>\n<p>\"Eh!\" she said, \"that pair's enjoyin' theirselves, I'll warrant. They'll</p>\n<p>get a good bit o' play actin' out of it</p>\n<p>an' there's nothin' children likes as much as play actin'.</p>\n<p>Let's hear what they do, Dickon lad.\"</p>",
        "<p>Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to</p>\n<p>tell her. His eyes were twinkling with fun.</p>\n<p>\"Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time</p>\n<p>he goes out,\" he explained. \"An' he flies out at</p>\n<p>John, th' footman, for not carryin' him careful enough. He</p>\n<p>makes himself as helpless lookin' as he can an' never</p>\n<p>lifts his head until we're out o' sight o' th'</p>",
        "<p>house. An' he grunts an' frets a good bit when</p>\n<p>he's bein' settled into his chair. Him an' Miss Mary's</p>\n<p>both got to enjoyin' it an' when he groans an'</p>\n<p>complains she'll say, 'Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so</p>\n<p>much? Are you so weak as that, poor Colin?'--but th'</p>\n<p>trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin'</p>\n<p>out laughin'. When we get safe into the garden they</p>",
        "<p>laugh till they've no breath left to laugh with. An'</p>\n<p>they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colin's cushions</p>\n<p>to keep the gardeners from hearin', if any of 'em's</p>\n<p>about.\"</p>\n<p>\"Th' more they laugh th' better for 'em!\" said Mrs.</p>\n<p>Sowerby, still laughing herself. \"Good healthy child laughin's better than</p>\n<p>pills any day o' th' year. That pair'll plump up</p>",
        "<p>for sure.\"</p>\n<p>\"They are plumpin' up,\" said Dickon. \"They're that hungry they</p>\n<p>don't know how to get enough to eat without makin'</p>\n<p>talk. Mester Colin says if he keeps sendin' for more</p>\n<p>food they won't believe he's an invalid at all. Miss</p>\n<p>Mary says she'll let him eat her share, but he</p>\n<p>says that if she goes hungry she'll get thin an'</p>",
        "<p>they mun both get fat at once.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this</p>\n<p>difficulty, that she quite rocked backward and forward in her</p>\n<p>blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with her.</p>\n<p>\"I'll tell thee what, lad,\" Mrs. Sowerby said when she</p>\n<p>could speak. \"I've thought of a way to help 'em.</p>\n<p>When tha' goes to 'em in th' mornin's tha' shall</p>",
        "<p>take a pail o' good new milk an' I'll bake</p>\n<p>'em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns wi' currants</p>\n<p>in 'em, same as you children like. Nothin's so good</p>\n<p>as fresh milk an' bread. Then they could take off</p>\n<p>th' edge o' their hunger while they were in their</p>\n<p>garden an' th' fine food they get indoors 'ud polish</p>\n<p>off th' corners.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Eh! mother!\" said Dickon admiringly, \"what a wonder tha' art!</p>\n<p>Tha' always sees a way out o' things. They was</p>\n<p>quite in a pother yesterday. They didn't see how they</p>\n<p>was to manage without orderin' up more food--they felt that</p>\n<p>empty inside.\"</p>\n<p>\"They're two young 'uns growin' fast, an' health's comin' back</p>\n<p>to both of 'em. Children like that feels like young</p>",
        "<p>wolves an' food's flesh an' blood to 'em,\" said Mrs.</p>\n<p>Sowerby. Then she smiled Dickon's own curving smile. \"Eh! but</p>\n<p>they're enjoyin' theirselves for sure,\" she said.</p>\n<p>She was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature--and she</p>\n<p>had never been more so than when she said their</p>\n<p>\"play actin'\" would be their joy. Colin and Mary found</p>\n<p>it one of their most thrilling sources of entertainment. The</p>",
        "<p>idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been unconsciously suggested</p>\n<p>to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven himself.</p>\n<p>\"Your appetite is improving very much, Master Colin,\" the nurse</p>\n<p>had said one day. \"You used to eat nothing, and</p>\n<p>so many things disagreed with you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing disagrees with me now,\" replied Colin, and then seeing</p>",
        "<p>the nurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that</p>\n<p>perhaps he ought not to appear too well just yet.</p>\n<p>\"At least things don't so often disagree with me. It's</p>\n<p>the fresh air.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps it is,\" said the nurse, still looking at him</p>\n<p>with a mystified expression. \"But I must talk to Dr.</p>\n<p>Craven about it.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"How she stared at you!\" said Mary when she went</p>\n<p>away. \"As if she thought there must be something to</p>\n<p>find out.\"</p>\n<p>\"I won't have her finding out things,\" said Colin. \"No</p>\n<p>one must begin to find out yet.\" When Dr. Craven</p>\n<p>came that morning he seemed puzzled, also. He asked a</p>\n<p>number of questions, to Colin's great annoyance.</p>",
        "<p>\"You stay out in the garden a great deal,\" he</p>\n<p>suggested. \"Where do you go?\"</p>\n<p>Colin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to</p>\n<p>opinion.</p>\n<p>\"I will not let any one know where I go,\"</p>\n<p>he answered. \"I go to a place I like. Every</p>\n<p>one has orders to keep out of the way. I</p>",
        "<p>won't be watched and stared at. You know that!\"</p>\n<p>\"You seem to be out all day but I do</p>\n<p>not think it has done you harm--I do not think</p>\n<p>so. The nurse says that you eat much more than</p>\n<p>you have ever done before.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps,\" said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, \"perhaps it</p>\n<p>is an unnatural appetite.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I do not think so, as your food seems to</p>\n<p>agree with you,\" said Dr. Craven. \"You are gaining flesh</p>\n<p>rapidly and your color is better.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps--perhaps I am bloated and feverish,\" said Colin, assuming a</p>\n<p>discouraging air of gloom. \"People who are not going to</p>\n<p>live are often--different.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven shook his head. He was holding Colin's wrist</p>",
        "<p>and he pushed up his sleeve and felt his arm.</p>\n<p>\"You are not feverish,\" he said thoughtfully, \"and such flesh</p>\n<p>as you have gained is healthy. If we can keep</p>\n<p>this up, my boy, we need not talk of dying.</p>\n<p>Your father will be very happy to hear of this</p>\n<p>remarkable improvement.\"</p>\n<p>\"I won't have him told!\" Colin broke forth fiercely. \"It</p>",
        "<p>will only disappoint him if I get worse again--and I</p>\n<p>may get worse this very night. I might have a</p>\n<p>raging fever. I feel as if I might be beginning</p>\n<p>to have one now. I won't have letters written to</p>\n<p>my father--I won't--I won't! You are making me angry and</p>\n<p>you know that is bad for me. I feel hot</p>\n<p>already. I hate being written about and being talked over</p>",
        "<p>as much as I hate being stared at!\"</p>\n<p>\"Hush-h! my boy,\" Dr. Craven soothed him. \"Nothing shall be</p>\n<p>written without your permission. You are too sensitive about things.</p>\n<p>You must not undo the good which has been done.\"</p>\n<p>He said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and</p>\n<p>when he saw the nurse he privately warned her that</p>\n<p>such a possibility must not be mentioned to the patient.</p>",
        "<p>\"The boy is extraordinarily better,\" he said. \"His advance seems</p>\n<p>almost abnormal. But of course he is doing now of</p>\n<p>his own free will what we could not make him</p>\n<p>do before. Still, he excites himself very easily and nothing</p>\n<p>must be said to irritate him.\"</p>\n<p>Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously.</p>\n<p>From this time dated their plan of \"play actin'.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I may be obliged to have a tantrum,\" said Colin</p>\n<p>regretfully. \"I don't want to have one and I'm not</p>\n<p>miserable enough now to work myself into a big one.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I couldn't have one at all. That lump doesn't</p>\n<p>come in my throat now and I keep thinking of</p>\n<p>nice things instead of horrible ones. But if they talk</p>\n<p>about writing to my father I shall have to do</p>",
        "<p>something.\"</p>\n<p>He made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately</p>\n<p>it was not possible to carry out this brilliant idea</p>\n<p>when he wakened each morning with an amazing appetite and</p>\n<p>the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast</p>\n<p>of home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam</p>\n<p>and clotted cream. Mary always breakfasted with him and when</p>",
        "<p>they found themselves at the table--particularly if there were delicate</p>\n<p>slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under</p>\n<p>a hot silver cover--they would look into each other's eyes</p>\n<p>in desperation.</p>\n<p>\"I think we shall have to eat it all this</p>\n<p>morning, Mary,\" Colin always ended by saying. \"We can send</p>\n<p>away some of the lunch and a great deal of</p>",
        "<p>the dinner.\"</p>\n<p>But they never found they could send away anything and</p>\n<p>the highly polished condition of the empty plates returned to</p>\n<p>the pantry awakened much comment.</p>\n<p>\"I do wish,\" Colin would say also, \"I do wish</p>\n<p>the slices of ham were thicker, and one muffin each</p>\n<p>is not enough for any one.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"It's enough for a person who is going to die,\"</p>\n<p>answered Mary when first she heard this, \"but it's not</p>\n<p>enough for a person who is going to live. I</p>\n<p>sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those</p>\n<p>nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come</p>\n<p>pouring in at the open window.\"</p>\n<p>The morning that Dickon--after they had been enjoying themselves in</p>",
        "<p>the garden for about two hours--went behind a big rose-bush</p>\n<p>and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that one</p>\n<p>was full of rich new milk with cream on the</p>\n<p>top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant</p>\n<p>buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns</p>\n<p>so carefully tucked in that they were still hot, there</p>\n<p>was a riot of surprised joyfulness. What a wonderful thing</p>",
        "<p>for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind, clever</p>\n<p>woman she must be! How good the buns were! And</p>\n<p>what delicious fresh milk!</p>\n<p>\"Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,\"</p>\n<p>said Colin. \"It makes her think of ways to do</p>\n<p>things--nice things. She is a Magic person. Tell her we</p>\n<p>are grateful, Dickon--extremely grateful.\"</p>",
        "<p>He was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times.</p>\n<p>He enjoyed them. He liked this so much that he</p>\n<p>improved upon it.</p>\n<p>\"Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude</p>\n<p>is extreme.\"</p>\n<p>And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed</p>\n<p>himself with buns and drank milk out of the pail</p>",
        "<p>in copious draughts in the manner of any hungry little</p>\n<p>boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathing in</p>\n<p>moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours</p>\n<p>behind him.</p>\n<p>This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the</p>\n<p>same kind. They actually awoke to the fact that as</p>\n<p>Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen people to provide food for she</p>",
        "<p>might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every</p>\n<p>day. So they asked her to let them send some</p>\n<p>of their shillings to buy things.</p>\n<p>Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in</p>\n<p>the park outside the garden where Mary had first found</p>\n<p>him piping to the wild creatures there was a deep</p>\n<p>little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny</p>",
        "<p>oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it.</p>\n<p>Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot</p>\n<p>potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit</p>\n<p>for a woodland king--besides being deliciously satisfying. You could buy</p>\n<p>both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you</p>\n<p>liked without feeling as if you were taking food out</p>\n<p>of the mouths of fourteen people.</p>",
        "<p>Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic</p>\n<p>circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening</p>\n<p>green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended. After the</p>\n<p>ceremony Colin always took his walking exercise and throughout the</p>\n<p>day he exercised his newly found power at intervals. Each</p>\n<p>day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and</p>\n<p>cover more ground. And each day his belief in the</p>",
        "<p>Magic grew stronger--as well it might. He tried one experiment</p>\n<p>after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it</p>\n<p>was Dickon who showed him the best things of all.</p>\n<p>\"Yesterday,\" he said one morning after an absence, \"I went</p>\n<p>to Thwaite for mother an' near th' Blue Cow Inn</p>\n<p>I seed Bob Haworth. He's the strongest chap on th'</p>\n<p>moor. He's the champion wrestler an' he can jump higher</p>",
        "<p>than any other chap an' throw th' hammer farther. He's</p>\n<p>gone all th' way to Scotland for th' sports some</p>\n<p>years. He's knowed me ever since I was a little</p>\n<p>'un an' he's a friendly sort an' I axed him</p>\n<p>some questions. Th' gentry calls him a athlete and I</p>\n<p>thought o' thee, Mester Colin, and I says, 'How did</p>\n<p>tha' make tha' muscles stick out that way, Bob? Did</p>",
        "<p>tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?' An'</p>\n<p>he says 'Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man</p>\n<p>in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me</p>\n<p>how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every muscle</p>\n<p>in my body.' An' I says, 'Could a delicate chap</p>\n<p>make himself stronger with 'em, Bob?' an' he laughed an'</p>\n<p>says, 'Art tha' th' delicate chap?' an' I says, 'No,</p>",
        "<p>but I knows a young gentleman that's gettin' well of</p>\n<p>a long illness an' I wish I knowed some o'</p>\n<p>them tricks to tell him about.' I didn't say no</p>\n<p>names an' he didn't ask none. He's friendly same as</p>\n<p>I said an' he stood up an' showed me good-natured</p>\n<p>like, an' I imitated what he did till I knowed</p>\n<p>it by heart.\"</p>",
        "<p>Colin had been listening excitedly.</p>\n<p>\"Can you show me?\" he cried. \"Will you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, to be sure,\" Dickon answered, getting up. \"But he</p>\n<p>says tha' mun do 'em gentle at first an' be</p>\n<p>careful not to tire thysel'. Rest in between times an'</p>\n<p>take deep breaths an' don't overdo.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll be careful,\" said Colin. \"Show me! Show me! Dickon,</p>",
        "<p>you are the most Magic boy in the world!\"</p>\n<p>Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through</p>\n<p>a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises. Colin</p>\n<p>watched them with widening eyes. He could do a few</p>\n<p>while he was sitting down. Presently he did a few</p>\n<p>gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet. Mary</p>\n<p>began to do them also. Soot, who was watching the</p>",
        "<p>performance, became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped</p>\n<p>about restlessly because he could not do them too.</p>\n<p>From that time the exercises were part of the day's</p>\n<p>duties as much as the Magic was. It became possible</p>\n<p>for both Colin and Mary to do more of them</p>\n<p>each time they tried, and such appetites were the results</p>\n<p>that but for the basket Dickon put down behind the</p>",
        "<p>bush each morning when he arrived they would have been</p>\n<p>lost. But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the</p>\n<p>nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again. You can trifle</p>\n<p>with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if</p>\n<p>you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and</p>\n<p>potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oat-cakes and buns</p>",
        "<p>and heather honey and clotted cream.</p>\n<p>\"They are eating next to nothing,\" said the nurse. \"They'll</p>\n<p>die of starvation if they can't be persuaded to take</p>\n<p>some nourishment. And yet see how they look.\"</p>\n<p>\"Look!\" exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. \"Eh! I'm moithered to death</p>\n<p>with them. They're a pair of young Satans. Bursting their</p>\n<p>jackets one day and the next turning up their noses</p>",
        "<p>at the best meals Cook can tempt them with. Not</p>\n<p>a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce</p>\n<p>did they set a fork into yesterday--and the poor woman</p>\n<p>fair _invented_ a pudding for them--and back it's sent. She</p>\n<p>almost cried. She's afraid she'll be blamed if they starve</p>\n<p>themselves into their graves.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully.</p>",
        "<p>He wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked</p>\n<p>with him and showed him the almost untouched tray of</p>\n<p>breakfast she had saved for him to look at--but it</p>\n<p>was even more worried when he sat down by Colin's</p>\n<p>sofa and examined him. He had been called to London</p>\n<p>on business and had not seen the boy for nearly</p>\n<p>two weeks. When young things begin to gain health they</p>",
        "<p>gain it rapidly. The waxen tinge had left Colin's skin</p>\n<p>and a warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes</p>\n<p>were clear and the hollows under them and in his</p>\n<p>cheeks and temples had filled out. His once dark, heavy</p>\n<p>locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily</p>\n<p>from his forehead and were soft and warm with life.</p>\n<p>His lips were fuller and of a normal color. In</p>",
        "<p>fact as an imitation of a boy who was a</p>\n<p>confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held</p>\n<p>his chin in his hand and thought him over.</p>\n<p>\"I am sorry to hear that you do not eat</p>\n<p>anything,\" he said. \"That will not do. You will lose</p>\n<p>all you have gained--and you have gained amazingly. You ate</p>\n<p>so well a short time ago.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"I told you it was an unnatural appetite,\" answered Colin.</p>\n<p>Mary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly</p>\n<p>made a very queer sound which she tried so violently</p>\n<p>to repress that she ended by almost choking.</p>\n<p>\"What is the matter?\" said Dr. Craven, turning to look</p>\n<p>at her.</p>\n<p>Mary became quite severe in her manner.</p>",
        "<p>\"It was something between a sneeze and a cough,\" she</p>\n<p>replied with reproachful dignity, \"and it got into my throat.\"</p>\n<p>\"But\" she said afterward to Colin, \"I couldn't stop myself.</p>\n<p>It just burst out because all at once I couldn't</p>\n<p>help remembering that last big potato you ate and the</p>\n<p>way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick</p>\n<p>lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Is there any way in which those children can get</p>\n<p>food secretly?\" Dr. Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.</p>\n<p>\"There's no way unless they dig it out of the</p>\n<p>earth or pick it off the trees,\" Mrs. Medlock answered.</p>\n<p>\"They stay out in the grounds all day and see</p>\n<p>no one but each other. And if they want anything</p>\n<p>different to eat from what's sent up to them they</p>",
        "<p>need only ask for it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said Dr. Craven, \"so long as going without food</p>\n<p>agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves. The boy</p>\n<p>is a new creature.\"</p>\n<p>\"So is the girl,\" said Mrs. Medlock. \"She's begun to</p>\n<p>be downright pretty since she's filled out and lost her</p>\n<p>ugly little sour look. Her hair's grown thick and healthy</p>",
        "<p>looking and she's got a bright color. The glummest, ill-natured</p>\n<p>little thing she used to be and now her and</p>\n<p>Master Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young</p>\n<p>ones. Perhaps they're growing fat on that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps they are,\" said Dr. Craven. \"Let them laugh.\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>\n<p>THE CURTAIN</p>\n<p>And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning</p>\n<p>revealed new miracles. In the robin's nest there were Eggs</p>\n<p>and the robin's mate sat upon them keeping them warm</p>\n<p>with her feathery little breast and careful wings. At first</p>\n<p>she was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly</p>\n<p>watchful. Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown corner</p>",
        "<p>in those days, but waited until by the quiet working</p>\n<p>of some mysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to</p>\n<p>the soul of the little pair that in the garden</p>\n<p>there was nothing which was not quite like themselves--nothing which</p>\n<p>did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to</p>\n<p>them--the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs.</p>\n<p>If there had been one person in that garden who</p>",
        "<p>had not known through all his or her innermost being</p>\n<p>that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the</p>\n<p>whole world would whirl round and crash through space and</p>\n<p>come to an end--if there had been even one who</p>\n<p>did not feel it and act accordingly there could have</p>\n<p>been no happiness even in that golden springtime air. But</p>\n<p>they all knew it and felt it and the robin</p>",
        "<p>and his mate knew they knew it.</p>\n<p>At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp</p>\n<p>anxiety. For some mysterious reason he knew he need not</p>\n<p>watch Dickon. The first moment he set his dew-bright black</p>\n<p>eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger</p>\n<p>but a sort of robin without beak or feathers. He</p>\n<p>could speak robin (which is a quite distinct language not</p>",
        "<p>to be mistaken for any other). To speak robin to</p>\n<p>a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman. Dickon</p>\n<p>always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer</p>\n<p>gibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not</p>\n<p>matter in the least. The robin thought he spoke this</p>\n<p>gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough to</p>\n<p>understand feathered speech. His movements also were robin. They never</p>",
        "<p>startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or</p>\n<p>threatening. Any robin could understand Dickon, so his presence was</p>\n<p>not even disturbing.</p>\n<p>But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on</p>\n<p>guard against the other two. In the first place the</p>\n<p>boy creature did not come into the garden on his</p>\n<p>legs. He was pushed in on a thing with wheels</p>",
        "<p>and the skins of wild animals were thrown over him.</p>\n<p>That in itself was doubtful. Then when he began to</p>\n<p>stand up and move about he did it in a</p>\n<p>queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to</p>\n<p>help him. The robin used to secrete himself in a</p>\n<p>bush and watch this anxiously, his head tilted first on</p>\n<p>one side and then on the other. He thought that</p>",
        "<p>the slow movements might mean that he was preparing to</p>\n<p>pounce, as cats do. When cats are preparing to pounce</p>\n<p>they creep over the ground very slowly. The robin talked</p>\n<p>this over with his mate a great deal for a</p>\n<p>few days but after that he decided not to speak</p>\n<p>of the subject because her terror was so great that</p>\n<p>he was afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.</p>",
        "<p>When the boy began to walk by himself and even</p>\n<p>to move more quickly it was an immense relief. But</p>\n<p>for a long time--or it seemed a long time to</p>\n<p>the robin--he was a source of some anxiety. He did</p>\n<p>not act as the other humans did. He seemed very</p>\n<p>fond of walking but he had a way of sitting</p>\n<p>or lying down for a while and then getting up</p>",
        "<p>in a disconcerting manner to begin again.</p>\n<p>One day the robin remembered that when he himself had</p>\n<p>been made to learn to fly by his parents he</p>\n<p>had done much the same sort of thing. He had</p>\n<p>taken short flights of a few yards and then had</p>\n<p>been obliged to rest. So it occurred to him that</p>\n<p>this boy was learning to fly--or rather to walk. He</p>",
        "<p>mentioned this to his mate and when he told her</p>\n<p>that the Eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same</p>\n<p>way after they were fledged she was quite comforted and</p>\n<p>even became eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching</p>\n<p>the boy over the edge of her nest--though she always</p>\n<p>thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer and learn</p>\n<p>more quickly. But then she said indulgently that humans were</p>",
        "<p>always more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of</p>\n<p>them never seemed really to learn to fly at all.</p>\n<p>You never met them in the air or on tree-tops.</p>\n<p>After a while the boy began to move about as</p>\n<p>the others did, but all three of the children at</p>\n<p>times did unusual things. They would stand under the trees</p>\n<p>and move their arms and legs and heads about in</p>",
        "<p>a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting</p>\n<p>down. They went through these movements at intervals every day</p>\n<p>and the robin was never able to explain to his</p>\n<p>mate what they were doing or trying to do. He</p>\n<p>could only say that he was sure that the Eggs</p>\n<p>would never flap about in such a manner; but as</p>\n<p>the boy who could speak robin so fluently was doing</p>",
        "<p>the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that</p>\n<p>the actions were not of a dangerous nature. Of course</p>\n<p>neither the robin nor his mate had ever heard of</p>\n<p>the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his exercises for making</p>\n<p>the muscles stand out like lumps. Robins are not like</p>\n<p>human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first</p>\n<p>and so they develop themselves in a natural manner. If</p>",
        "<p>you have to fly about to find every meal you</p>\n<p>eat, your muscles do not become atrophied (atrophied means wasted</p>\n<p>away through want of use).</p>\n<p>When the boy was walking and running about and digging</p>\n<p>and weeding like the others, the nest in the corner</p>\n<p>was brooded over by a great peace and content. Fears</p>\n<p>for the Eggs became things of the past. Knowing that</p>",
        "<p>your Eggs were as safe as if they were locked</p>\n<p>in a bank vault and the fact that you could</p>\n<p>watch so many curious things going on made setting a</p>\n<p>most entertaining occupation. On wet days the Eggs' mother sometimes</p>\n<p>felt even a little dull because the children did not</p>\n<p>come into the garden.</p>\n<p>But even on wet days it could not be said</p>",
        "<p>that Mary and Colin were dull. One morning when the</p>\n<p>rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin was beginning to feel</p>\n<p>a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on</p>\n<p>his sofa because it was not safe to get up</p>\n<p>and walk about, Mary had an inspiration.</p>\n<p>\"Now that I am a real boy,\" Colin had said,</p>\n<p>\"my legs and arms and all my body are so</p>",
        "<p>full of Magic that I can't keep them still. They</p>\n<p>want to be doing things all the time. Do you</p>\n<p>know that when I waken in the morning, Mary, when</p>\n<p>it's quite early and the birds are just shouting outside</p>\n<p>and everything seems just shouting for joy--even the trees and</p>\n<p>things we can't really hear--I feel as if I must</p>\n<p>jump out of bed and shout myself. And if I</p>",
        "<p>did it, just think what would happen!\"</p>\n<p>Mary giggled inordinately.</p>\n<p>\"The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come</p>\n<p>running and they would be sure you had gone crazy</p>\n<p>and they'd send for the doctor,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Colin giggled himself. He could see how they would all</p>\n<p>look--how horrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see</p>",
        "<p>him standing upright.</p>\n<p>\"I wish my father would come home,\" he said. \"I</p>\n<p>want to tell him myself. I'm always thinking about it--but</p>\n<p>we couldn't go on like this much longer. I can't</p>\n<p>stand lying still and pretending, and besides I look too</p>\n<p>different. I wish it wasn't raining to-day.\"</p>\n<p>It was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.</p>",
        "<p>\"Colin,\" she began mysteriously, \"do you know how many rooms</p>\n<p>there are in this house?\"</p>\n<p>\"About a thousand, I suppose,\" he answered.</p>\n<p>\"There's about a hundred no one ever goes into,\" said</p>\n<p>Mary. \"And one rainy day I went and looked into</p>\n<p>ever so many of them. No one ever knew, though</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out. I lost my way</p>",
        "<p>when I was coming back and I stopped at the</p>\n<p>end of your corridor. That was the second time I</p>\n<p>heard you crying.\"</p>\n<p>Colin started up on his sofa.</p>\n<p>\"A hundred rooms no one goes into,\" he said. \"It</p>\n<p>sounds almost like a secret garden. Suppose we go and</p>\n<p>look at them. You could wheel me in my chair</p>",
        "<p>and nobody would know where we went.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's what I was thinking,\" said Mary. \"No one would</p>\n<p>dare to follow us. There are galleries where you could</p>\n<p>run. We could do our exercises. There is a little</p>\n<p>Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory</p>\n<p>elephants. There are all sorts of rooms.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ring the bell,\" said Colin.</p>",
        "<p>When the nurse came in he gave his orders.</p>\n<p>\"I want my chair,\" he said. \"Miss Mary and I</p>\n<p>are going to look at the part of the house</p>\n<p>which is not used. John can push me as far</p>\n<p>as the picture-gallery because there are some stairs. Then he</p>\n<p>must go away and leave us alone until I send</p>\n<p>for him again.\"</p>",
        "<p>Rainy days lost their terrors that morning. When the footman</p>\n<p>had wheeled the chair into the picture-gallery and left the</p>\n<p>two together in obedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked</p>\n<p>at each other delighted. As soon as Mary had made</p>\n<p>sure that John was really on his way back to</p>\n<p>his own quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his</p>\n<p>chair.</p>",
        "<p>\"I am going to run from one end of the</p>\n<p>gallery to the other,\" he said, \"and then I am</p>\n<p>going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth's</p>\n<p>exercises.\"</p>\n<p>And they did all these things and many others. They</p>\n<p>looked at the portraits and found the plain little girl</p>\n<p>dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on her</p>",
        "<p>finger.</p>\n<p>\"All these,\" said Colin, \"must be my relations. They lived</p>\n<p>a long time ago. That parrot one, I believe, is</p>\n<p>one of my great, great, great, great aunts. She looks</p>\n<p>rather like you, Mary--not as you look now but as</p>\n<p>you looked when you came here. Now you are a</p>\n<p>great deal fatter and better looking.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"So are you,\" said Mary, and they both laughed.</p>\n<p>They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with</p>\n<p>the ivory elephants. They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and</p>\n<p>the hole in the cushion the mouse had left but</p>\n<p>the mice had grown up and run away and the</p>\n<p>hole was empty. They saw more rooms and made more</p>\n<p>discoveries than Mary had made on her first pilgrimage. They</p>",
        "<p>found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and</p>\n<p>new old pictures they liked and weird old things they</p>\n<p>did not know the use of. It was a curiously</p>\n<p>entertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the</p>\n<p>same house with other people but at the same time</p>\n<p>feeling as if one were miles away from them was</p>\n<p>a fascinating thing.</p>",
        "<p>\"I'm glad we came,\" Colin said. \"I never knew I</p>\n<p>lived in such a big queer old place. I like</p>\n<p>it. We will ramble about every rainy day. We shall</p>\n<p>always be finding new queer corners and things.\"</p>\n<p>That morning they had found among other things such good</p>\n<p>appetites that when they returned to Colin's room it was</p>\n<p>not possible to send the luncheon away untouched.</p>",
        "<p>When the nurse carried the tray down-stairs she slapped it</p>\n<p>down on the kitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the</p>\n<p>cook, could see the highly polished dishes and plates.</p>\n<p>\"Look at that!\" she said. \"This is a house of</p>\n<p>mystery, and those two children are the greatest mysteries in</p>\n<p>it.\"</p>\n<p>\"If they keep that up every day,\" said the strong</p>",
        "<p>young footman John, \"there'd be small wonder that he weighs</p>\n<p>twice as much to-day as he did a month ago.</p>\n<p>I should have to give up my place in time,</p>\n<p>for fear of doing my muscles an injury.\"</p>\n<p>That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in</p>\n<p>Colin's room. She had noticed it the day before but</p>\n<p>had said nothing because she thought the change might have</p>",
        "<p>been made by chance. She said nothing to-day but she</p>\n<p>sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel.</p>\n<p>She could look at it because the curtain had been</p>\n<p>drawn aside. That was the change she noticed.</p>\n<p>\"I know what you want me to tell you,\" said</p>\n<p>Colin, after she had stared a few minutes. \"I always</p>\n<p>know when you want me to tell you something. You</p>",
        "<p>are wondering why the curtain is drawn back. I am</p>\n<p>going to keep it like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" asked Mary.</p>\n<p>\"Because it doesn't make me angry any more to see</p>\n<p>her laughing. I wakened when it was bright moonlight two</p>\n<p>nights ago and felt as if the Magic was filling</p>\n<p>the room and making everything so splendid that I couldn't</p>",
        "<p>lie still. I got up and looked out of the</p>\n<p>window. The room was quite light and there was a</p>\n<p>patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made</p>\n<p>me go and pull the cord. She looked right down</p>\n<p>at me as if she were laughing because she was</p>\n<p>glad I was standing there. It made me like to</p>\n<p>look at her. I want to see her laughing like</p>",
        "<p>that all the time. I think she must have been</p>\n<p>a sort of Magic person perhaps.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are so like her now,\" said Mary, \"that sometimes</p>\n<p>I think perhaps you are her ghost made into a</p>\n<p>boy.\"</p>\n<p>That idea seemed to impress Colin. He thought it over</p>\n<p>and then answered her slowly.</p>",
        "<p>\"If I were her ghost--my father would be fond of</p>\n<p>me,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Do you want him to be fond of you?\" inquired</p>\n<p>Mary.</p>\n<p>\"I used to hate it because he was not fond</p>\n<p>of me. If he grew fond of me I think</p>\n<p>I should tell him about the Magic. It might make</p>",
        "<p>him more cheerful.\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>\n<p>\"IT'S MOTHER!\"</p>\n<p>Their belief in the Magic was an abiding thing. After</p>\n<p>the morning's incantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.</p>\n<p>\"I like to do it,\" he explained, \"because when I</p>\n<p>grow up and make great scientific discoveries I shall be</p>\n<p>obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise.</p>\n<p>I can only give short lectures now because I am</p>",
        "<p>very young, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if</p>\n<p>he was in church and he would go to sleep.\"</p>\n<p>\"Th' best thing about lecturin',\" said Ben, \"is that a</p>\n<p>chap can get up an' say aught he pleases an'</p>\n<p>no other chap can answer him back. I wouldn't be</p>\n<p>agen' lecturin' a bit mysel' sometimes.\"</p>\n<p>But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben</p>",
        "<p>fixed devouring eyes on him and kept them there. He</p>\n<p>looked him over with critical affection. It was not so</p>\n<p>much the lecture which interested him as the legs which</p>\n<p>looked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which</p>\n<p>held itself up so well, the once sharp chin and</p>\n<p>hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the</p>\n<p>eyes which had begun to hold the light he remembered</p>",
        "<p>in another pair. Sometimes when Colin felt Ben's earnest gaze</p>\n<p>meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he</p>\n<p>was reflecting on and once when he had seemed quite</p>\n<p>entranced he questioned him.</p>\n<p>\"What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"I was thinkin',\" answered Ben, \"as I'd warrant tha's gone</p>\n<p>up three or four pound this week. I was lookin'</p>",
        "<p>at tha' calves an' tha' shoulders. I'd like to get</p>\n<p>thee on a pair o' scales.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's the Magic and--and Mrs. Sowerby's buns and milk and</p>\n<p>things,\" said Colin. \"You see the scientific experiment has succeeded.\"</p>\n<p>That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture.</p>\n<p>When he came he was ruddy with running and his</p>\n<p>funny face looked more twinkling than usual. As they had</p>",
        "<p>a good deal of weeding to do after the rains</p>\n<p>they fell to work. They always had plenty to do</p>\n<p>after a warm deep sinking rain. The moisture which was</p>\n<p>good for the flowers was also good for the weeds</p>\n<p>which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of</p>\n<p>leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took</p>\n<p>too firm hold. Colin was as good at weeding as</p>",
        "<p>any one in these days and he could lecture while</p>\n<p>he was doing it.</p>\n<p>\"The Magic works best when you work yourself,\" he said</p>\n<p>this morning. \"You can feel it in your bones and</p>\n<p>muscles. I am going to read books about bones and</p>\n<p>muscles, but I am going to write a book about</p>\n<p>Magic. I am making it up now. I keep finding</p>",
        "<p>out things.\"</p>\n<p>It was not very long after he had said this</p>\n<p>that he laid down his trowel and stood up on</p>\n<p>his feet. He had been silent for several minutes and</p>\n<p>they had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as</p>\n<p>he often did. When he dropped his trowel and stood</p>\n<p>upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon as if a</p>",
        "<p>sudden strong thought had made him do it. He stretched</p>\n<p>himself out to his tallest height and he threw out</p>\n<p>his arms exultantly. Color glowed in his face and his</p>\n<p>strange eyes widened with joyfulness. All at once he had</p>\n<p>realized something to the full.</p>\n<p>\"Mary! Dickon!\" he cried. \"Just look at me!\"</p>\n<p>They stopped their weeding and looked at him.</p>",
        "<p>\"Do you remember that first morning you brought me in</p>\n<p>here?\" he demanded.</p>\n<p>Dickon was looking at him very hard. Being an animal</p>\n<p>charmer he could see more things than most people could</p>\n<p>and many of them were things he never talked about.</p>\n<p>He saw some of them now in this boy.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that we do,\" he answered.</p>",
        "<p>Mary looked hard too, but she said nothing.</p>\n<p>\"Just this minute,\" said Colin, \"all at once I remembered</p>\n<p>it myself--when I looked at my hand digging with the</p>\n<p>trowel--and I had to stand up on my feet to</p>\n<p>see if it was real. And it _is_ real! I'm</p>\n<p>_well_--I'm _well_!\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that tha' art!\" said Dickon.</p>",
        "<p>\"I'm well! I'm well!\" said Colin again, and his face</p>\n<p>went quite red all over.</p>\n<p>He had known it before in a way, he had</p>\n<p>hoped it and felt it and thought about it, but</p>\n<p>just at that minute something had rushed all through him--a</p>\n<p>sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been</p>\n<p>so strong that he could not help calling out.</p>",
        "<p>\"I shall live forever and ever and ever!\" he cried</p>\n<p>grandly. \"I shall find out thousands and thousands of things.</p>\n<p>I shall find out about people and creatures and everything</p>\n<p>that grows--like Dickon--and I shall never stop making Magic. I'm</p>\n<p>well! I'm well! I feel--I feel as if I want</p>\n<p>to shout out something--something thankful, joyful!\"</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced</p>",
        "<p>round at him.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' might sing th' Doxology,\" he suggested in his dryest</p>\n<p>grunt. He had no opinion of the Doxology and he</p>\n<p>did not make the suggestion with any particular reverence.</p>\n<p>But Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew</p>\n<p>nothing about the Doxology.</p>\n<p>\"What is that?\" he inquired.</p>",
        "<p>\"Dickon can sing it for thee, I'll warrant,\" replied Ben</p>\n<p>Weatherstaff.</p>\n<p>Dickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer's smile.</p>\n<p>\"They sing it i' church,\" he said. \"Mother says she</p>\n<p>believes th' skylarks sings it when they gets up i'</p>\n<p>th' mornin'.\"</p>\n<p>\"If she says that, it must be a nice song,\"</p>",
        "<p>Colin answered. \"I've never been in a church myself. I</p>\n<p>was always too ill. Sing it, Dickon. I want to</p>\n<p>hear it.\"</p>\n<p>Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it. He understood</p>\n<p>what Colin felt better than Colin did himself. He understood</p>\n<p>by a sort of instinct so natural that he did</p>\n<p>not know it was understanding. He pulled off his cap</p>",
        "<p>and looked round still smiling.</p>\n<p>\"Tha' must take off tha' cap,\" he said to Colin,</p>\n<p>\"an' so mun tha', Ben--an' tha' mun stand up, tha'</p>\n<p>knows.\"</p>\n<p>Colin took off his cap and the sun shone on</p>\n<p>and warmed his thick hair as he watched Dickon intently.</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his knees and bared his</p>",
        "<p>head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look on</p>\n<p>his old face as if he didn't know exactly why</p>\n<p>he was doing this remarkable thing.</p>\n<p>Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began</p>\n<p>to sing in quite a simple matter-of-fact way and in</p>\n<p>a nice strong boy voice:</p>\n<p>\"Praise God from whom all blessings flow, Praise Him all</p>",
        "<p>creatures here below, Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host, Praise</p>\n<p>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.\"</p>\n<p>When he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still</p>\n<p>with his jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look</p>\n<p>in his eyes fixed on Colin. Colin's face was thoughtful</p>\n<p>and appreciative.</p>\n<p>\"It is a very nice song,\" he said. \"I like</p>",
        "<p>it. Perhaps it means just what I mean when I</p>\n<p>want to shout out that I am thankful to the</p>\n<p>Magic.\" He stopped and thought in a puzzled way. \"Perhaps</p>\n<p>they are both the same thing. How can we know</p>\n<p>the exact names of everything? Sing it again, Dickon. Let</p>\n<p>us try, Mary. I want to sing it, too. It's</p>\n<p>my song. How does it begin? 'Praise God from whom</p>",
        "<p>all blessings flow'?\"</p>\n<p>[Illustration: \"'PRAISE GOD FROM WHOM ALL BLESSINGS FLOW'\"--_Page 344_]</p>\n<p>And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted</p>\n<p>their voices as musically as they could and Dickon's swelled</p>\n<p>quite loud and beautiful--and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff</p>\n<p>raspingly cleared his throat and at the third he joined</p>\n<p>in with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and</p>",
        "<p>when the \"Amen\" came to an end Mary observed that</p>\n<p>the very same thing had happened to him which had</p>\n<p>happened when he found out that Colin was not a</p>\n<p>cripple--his chin was twitching and he was staring and winking</p>\n<p>and his leathery old cheeks were wet.</p>\n<p>\"I never seed no sense in th' Doxology afore,\" he</p>\n<p>said hoarsely, \"but I may change my mind i' time.</p>",
        "<p>I should say tha'd gone up five pound this week,</p>\n<p>Mester Colin--five on 'em!\"</p>\n<p>Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting his</p>\n<p>attention and his expression had become a startled one.</p>\n<p>\"Who is coming in here?\" he said quickly. \"Who is</p>\n<p>it?\"</p>\n<p>The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently</p>",
        "<p>open and a woman had entered. She had come in</p>\n<p>with the last line of their song and she had</p>\n<p>stood still listening and looking at them. With the ivy</p>\n<p>behind her, the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling</p>\n<p>her long blue cloak, and her nice fresh face smiling</p>\n<p>across the greenery she was rather like a softly colored</p>\n<p>illustration in one of Colin's books. She had wonderful affectionate</p>",
        "<p>eyes which seemed to take everything in--all of them, even</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff and the \"creatures\" and every flower that was</p>\n<p>in bloom. Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of</p>\n<p>them felt that she was an intruder at all. Dickon's</p>\n<p>eyes lighted like lamps.</p>\n<p>\"It's Mother--that's who it is!\" he cried and he went</p>\n<p>across the grass at a run.</p>",
        "<p>Colin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went</p>\n<p>with him. They both felt their pulses beat faster.</p>\n<p>\"It's Mother!\" Dickon said again when they met half-way. \"I</p>\n<p>knowed tha' wanted to see her an' I told her</p>\n<p>where th' door was hid.\"</p>\n<p>Colin held out his hand with a sort of flushed</p>\n<p>royal shyness but his eyes quite devoured her face.</p>",
        "<p>\"Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,\"</p>\n<p>he said, \"you and Dickon and the secret garden. I'd</p>\n<p>never wanted to see any one or anything before.\"</p>\n<p>The sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden</p>\n<p>change in her own. She flushed and the corners of</p>\n<p>her mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over</p>\n<p>her eyes.</p>",
        "<p>\"Eh! dear lad!\" she broke out tremulously. \"Eh! dear lad!\"</p>\n<p>as if she had not known she were going to</p>\n<p>say it. She did not say, \"Mester Colin,\" but just</p>\n<p>\"dear lad\" quite suddenly. She might have said it to</p>\n<p>Dickon in the same way if she had seen something</p>\n<p>in his face which touched her. Colin liked it.</p>\n<p>\"Are you surprised because I am so well?\" he asked.</p>",
        "<p>She put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the</p>\n<p>mist out of her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that I am!\" she said; \"but tha'rt so like</p>\n<p>thy mother tha' made my heart jump.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think,\" said Colin a little awkwardly, \"that will</p>\n<p>make my father like me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Aye, for sure, dear lad,\" she answered and she gave</p>",
        "<p>his shoulder a soft quick pat. \"He mun come home--he</p>\n<p>mun come home.\"</p>\n<p>\"Susan Sowerby,\" said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her. \"Look</p>\n<p>at th' lad's legs, wilt tha'? They was like drumsticks</p>\n<p>i' stockin' two month' ago--an' I heard folk tell as</p>\n<p>they was bandy an' knock-kneed both at th' same time.</p>\n<p>Look at 'em now!\"</p>",
        "<p>Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.</p>\n<p>\"They're goin' to be fine strong lad's legs in a</p>\n<p>bit,\" she said. \"Let him go on playin' an' workin'</p>\n<p>in th' garden an' eatin' hearty an' drinkin' plenty o'</p>\n<p>good sweet milk an' there'll not be a finer pair</p>\n<p>i' Yorkshire, thank God for it.\"</p>\n<p>She put both hands on Mistress Mary's shoulders and looked</p>",
        "<p>her little face over in a motherly fashion.</p>\n<p>\"An' thee, too!\" she said. \"Tha'rt grown near as hearty</p>\n<p>as our 'Lizabeth Ellen. I'll warrant tha'rt like thy mother</p>\n<p>too. Our Martha told me as Mrs. Medlock heard she</p>\n<p>was a pretty woman. Tha'lt be like a blush rose</p>\n<p>when tha' grows up, my little lass, bless thee.\"</p>\n<p>She did not mention that when Martha came home on</p>",
        "<p>her \"day out\" and described the plain sallow child she</p>\n<p>had said that she had no confidence whatever in what</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock had heard. \"It doesn't stand to reason that</p>\n<p>a pretty woman could be th' mother o' such a</p>\n<p>fou' little lass,\" she had added obstinately.</p>\n<p>Mary had not had time to pay much attention to</p>\n<p>her changing face. She had only known that she looked</p>",
        "<p>\"different\" and seemed to have a great deal more hair</p>\n<p>and that it was growing very fast. But remembering her</p>\n<p>pleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past</p>\n<p>she was glad to hear that she might some day</p>\n<p>look like her.</p>\n<p>Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was</p>\n<p>told the whole story of it and shown every bush</p>",
        "<p>and tree which had come alive. Colin walked on one</p>\n<p>side of her and Mary on the other. Each of</p>\n<p>them kept looking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly</p>\n<p>curious about the delightful feeling she gave them--a sort of</p>\n<p>warm, supported feeling. It seemed as if she understood them</p>\n<p>as Dickon understood his \"creatures.\" She stooped over the flowers</p>\n<p>and talked about them as if they were children. Soot</p>",
        "<p>followed her and once or twice cawed at her and</p>\n<p>flew upon her shoulder as if it were Dickon's. When</p>\n<p>they told her about the robin and the first flight</p>\n<p>of the young ones she laughed a motherly little mellow</p>\n<p>laugh in her throat.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose learnin' 'em to fly is like learnin' children</p>\n<p>to walk, but I'm feared I should be all in</p>",
        "<p>a worrit if mine had wings instead o' legs,\" she</p>\n<p>said.</p>\n<p>It was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in</p>\n<p>her nice moorland cottage way that at last she was</p>\n<p>told about the Magic.</p>\n<p>\"Do you believe in Magic?\" asked Colin after he had</p>\n<p>explained about Indian fakirs. \"I do hope you do.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"That I do, lad,\" she answered. \"I never knowed it</p>\n<p>by that name but what does th' name matter? I</p>\n<p>warrant they call it a different name i' France an'</p>\n<p>a different one i' Germany. Th' same thing as set</p>\n<p>th' seeds swellin' an' th' sun shinin' made thee a</p>\n<p>well lad an' it's th' Good Thing. It isn't like</p>\n<p>us poor fools as think it matters if us is</p>",
        "<p>called out of our names. Th' Big Good Thing doesn't</p>\n<p>stop to worrit, bless thee. It goes on makin' worlds</p>\n<p>by th' million--worlds like us. Never thee stop believin' in</p>\n<p>th' Big Good Thing an' knowin' th' world's full of</p>\n<p>it--an' call it what tha' likes. Tha' wert singin' to</p>\n<p>it when I come into th' garden.\"</p>\n<p>\"I felt so joyful,\" said Colin, opening his beautiful strange</p>",
        "<p>eyes at her. \"Suddenly I felt how different I was--how</p>\n<p>strong my arms and legs were, you know--and how I</p>\n<p>could dig and stand--and I jumped up and wanted to</p>\n<p>shout out something to anything that would listen.\"</p>\n<p>\"Th' Magic listened when tha' sung th' Doxology. It would</p>\n<p>ha' listened to anything tha'd sung. It was th' joy</p>\n<p>that mattered. Eh! lad, lad--what's names to th' Joy Maker,\"</p>",
        "<p>and she gave his shoulders a quick soft pat again.</p>\n<p>She had packed a basket which held a regular feast</p>\n<p>this morning, and when the hungry hour came and Dickon</p>\n<p>brought it out from its hiding place, she sat down</p>\n<p>with them under their tree and watched them devour their</p>\n<p>food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites. She was</p>\n<p>full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts</p>",
        "<p>of odd things. She told them stories in broad Yorkshire</p>\n<p>and taught them new words. She laughed as if she</p>\n<p>could not help it when they told her of the</p>\n<p>increasing difficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still</p>\n<p>a fretful invalid.</p>\n<p>\"You see we can't help laughing nearly all the time</p>\n<p>when we are together,\" explained Colin. \"And it doesn't sound</p>",
        "<p>ill at all. We try to choke it back but</p>\n<p>it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.\"</p>\n<p>\"There's one thing that comes into my mind so often,\"</p>\n<p>said Mary, \"and I can scarcely ever hold in when</p>\n<p>I think of it suddenly. I keep thinking suppose Colin's</p>\n<p>face should get to look like a full moon. It</p>\n<p>isn't like one yet but he gets a tiny bit</p>",
        "<p>fatter every day--and suppose some morning it should look like</p>\n<p>one--what should we do!\"</p>\n<p>\"Bless us all, I can see tha' has a good</p>\n<p>bit o' play actin' to do,\" said Susan Sowerby. \"But</p>\n<p>tha' won't have to keep it up much longer. Mester</p>\n<p>Craven'll come home.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think he will?\" asked Colin. \"Why?\"</p>",
        "<p>Susan Sowerby chuckled softly.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose it 'ud nigh break thy heart if he</p>\n<p>found out before tha' told him in tha' own way,\"</p>\n<p>she said. \"Tha's laid awake nights plannin' it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't bear any one else to tell him,\" said</p>\n<p>Colin. \"I think about different ways every day. I think</p>\n<p>now I just want to run into his room.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"That'd be a fine start for him,\" said Susan Sowerby.</p>\n<p>\"I'd like to see his face, lad. I would that!</p>\n<p>He mun come back--that he mun.\"</p>\n<p>One of the things they talked of was the visit</p>\n<p>they were to make to her cottage. They planned it</p>\n<p>all. They were to drive over the moor and lunch</p>\n<p>out of doors among the heather. They would see all</p>",
        "<p>the twelve children and Dickon's garden and would not come</p>\n<p>back until they were tired.</p>\n<p>Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the</p>\n<p>house and Mrs. Medlock. It was time for Colin to</p>\n<p>be wheeled back also. But before he got into his</p>\n<p>chair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his</p>\n<p>eyes on her with a kind of bewildered adoration and</p>",
        "<p>he suddenly caught hold of the fold of her blue</p>\n<p>cloak and held it fast.</p>\n<p>\"You are just what I--what I wanted,\" he said. \"I</p>\n<p>wish you were my mother--as well as Dickon's!\"</p>\n<p>All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him</p>\n<p>with her warm arms close against the bosom under the</p>\n<p>blue cloak--as if he had been Dickon's brother. The quick</p>",
        "<p>mist swept over her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Eh! dear lad!\" she said. \"Thy own mother's in this</p>\n<p>'ere very garden, I do believe. She couldna' keep out</p>\n<p>of it. Thy father mun come back to thee--he mun!\"</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>\n<p>IN THE GARDEN</p>\n<p>In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful</p>\n<p>things have been discovered.

At first people refuse to believe</p>\n<p>that a strange new thing can be done, then they</p>",
        "<p>begin to hope it can be done, then they see</p>\n<p>it can be done--then it is done and all the</p>\n<p>world wonders why it was not done centuries ago. One</p>\n<p>of the new things people began to find out in</p>\n<p>the last century was that thoughts--just mere thoughts--are as powerful</p>\n<p>as electric batteries--as good for one as sunlight is, or</p>\n<p>as bad for one as poison. To let a sad</p>",
        "<p>thought or a bad one get into your mind is</p>\n<p>as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into</p>\n<p>your body. If you let it stay there after it</p>\n<p>has got in you may never get over it as</p>\n<p>long as you live.</p>\n<p>So long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable</p>\n<p>thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and</p>",
        "<p>her determination not to be pleased by or interested in</p>\n<p>anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child.</p>\n<p>Circumstances, however, were very kind to her, though she was</p>\n<p>not at all aware of it. They began to push</p>\n<p>her about for her own good. When her mind gradually</p>\n<p>filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children,</p>\n<p>with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids,</p>",
        "<p>with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by</p>\n<p>day, and also with a moor boy and his \"creatures,\"</p>\n<p>there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which</p>\n<p>affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow</p>\n<p>and tired.</p>\n<p>So long as Colin shut himself up in his room</p>\n<p>and thought only of his fears and weakness and his</p>",
        "<p>detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly</p>\n<p>on humps and early death, he was a hysterical half-crazy</p>\n<p>little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the</p>\n<p>spring and also did not know that he could get</p>\n<p>well and could stand upon his feet if he tried</p>\n<p>to do it. When new beautiful thoughts began to push</p>\n<p>out the old hideous ones, life began to come back</p>",
        "<p>to him, his blood ran healthily through his veins and</p>\n<p>strength poured into him like a flood. His scientific experiment</p>\n<p>was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird</p>\n<p>about it at all. Much more surprising things can happen</p>\n<p>to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought</p>\n<p>comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember</p>\n<p>in time and push it out by putting in an</p>",
        "<p>agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in one</p>\n<p>place.</p>\n<p>\"Where you tend a rose, my lad, A thistle cannot</p>\n<p>grow.\"</p>\n<p>While the secret garden was coming alive and two children</p>\n<p>were coming alive with it, there was a man wandering</p>\n<p>about certain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and</p>",
        "<p>the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he was a</p>\n<p>man who for ten years had kept his mind filled</p>\n<p>with dark and heart-broken thinking. He had not been courageous;</p>\n<p>he had never tried to put any other thoughts in</p>\n<p>the place of the dark ones. He had wandered by</p>\n<p>blue lakes and thought them; he had lain on mountain-sides</p>\n<p>with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him</p>",
        "<p>and flower breaths filling all the air and he had</p>\n<p>thought them. A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when</p>\n<p>he had been happy and he had let his soul</p>\n<p>fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow</p>\n<p>any rift of light to pierce through. He had forgotten</p>\n<p>and deserted his home and his duties. When he traveled</p>\n<p>about, darkness so brooded over him that the sight of</p>",
        "<p>him was a wrong done to other people because it</p>\n<p>was as if he poisoned the air about him with</p>\n<p>gloom. Most strangers thought he must be either half mad</p>\n<p>or a man with some hidden crime on his soul.</p>\n<p>He was a tall man with a drawn face and</p>\n<p>crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel</p>\n<p>registers was, \"Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.\"</p>",
        "<p>He had traveled far and wide since the day he</p>\n<p>saw Mistress Mary in his study and told her she</p>\n<p>might have her \"bit of earth.\" He had been in</p>\n<p>the most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained</p>\n<p>nowhere more than a few days. He had chosen the</p>\n<p>quietest and remotest spots. He had been on the tops</p>\n<p>of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had</p>",
        "<p>looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and</p>\n<p>touched them with such light as made it seem as</p>\n<p>if the world were just being born.</p>\n<p>But the light had never seemed to touch himself until</p>\n<p>one day when he realized that for the first time</p>\n<p>in ten years a strange thing had happened. He was</p>\n<p>in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he</p>",
        "<p>had been walking alone through such beauty as might have</p>\n<p>lifted any man's soul out of shadow. He had walked</p>\n<p>a long way and it had not lifted his. But</p>\n<p>at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself</p>\n<p>down to rest on a carpet of moss by a</p>\n<p>stream. It was a clear little stream which ran quite</p>\n<p>merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp</p>",
        "<p>greenness. Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low</p>\n<p>laughter as it bubbled over and round stones. He saw</p>\n<p>birds come and dip their heads to drink in it</p>\n<p>and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed</p>\n<p>like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made</p>\n<p>the stillness seem deeper. The valley was very, very still.</p>\n<p>As he sat gazing into the clear running of the</p>",
        "<p>water, Archibald Craven gradually felt his mind and body both</p>\n<p>grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself. He wondered</p>\n<p>if he were going to sleep, but he was not.</p>\n<p>He sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his</p>\n<p>eyes began to see things growing at its edge. There</p>\n<p>was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close</p>\n<p>to the stream that its leaves were wet and at</p>",
        "<p>these he found himself looking as he remembered he had</p>\n<p>looked at such things years ago. He was actually thinking</p>\n<p>tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue</p>\n<p>its hundreds of little blossoms were. He did not know</p>\n<p>that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind--filling</p>\n<p>and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.</p>\n<p>It was as if a sweet clear spring had begun</p>",
        "<p>to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and</p>\n<p>risen until at last it swept the dark water away.</p>\n<p>But of course he did not think of this himself.</p>\n<p>He only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter</p>\n<p>and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright</p>\n<p>delicate blueness. He did not know how long he sat</p>\n<p>there or what was happening to him, but at last</p>",
        "<p>he moved as if he were awakening and he got</p>\n<p>up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a</p>\n<p>long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself. Something seemed</p>\n<p>to have been unbound and released in him, very quietly.</p>\n<p>\"What is it?\" he said, almost in a whisper, and</p>\n<p>he passed his hand over his forehead. \"I almost feel</p>\n<p>as if--I were alive!\"</p>",
        "<p>I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered</p>\n<p>things to be able to explain how this had happened</p>\n<p>to him. Neither does any one else yet. He did</p>\n<p>not understand at all himself--but he remembered this strange hour</p>\n<p>months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he</p>\n<p>found out quite by accident that on this very day</p>\n<p>Colin had cried out as he went into the secret</p>",
        "<p>garden:</p>\n<p>\"I am going to live forever and ever and ever!\"</p>\n<p>The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the</p>\n<p>evening and he slept a new reposeful sleep; but it</p>\n<p>was not with him very long. He did not know</p>\n<p>that it could be kept. By the next night he</p>\n<p>had opened the doors wide to his dark thoughts and</p>",
        "<p>they had come trooping and rushing back. He left the</p>\n<p>valley and went on his wandering way again. But, strange</p>\n<p>as it seemed to him, there were minutes--sometimes half-hours--when, without</p>\n<p>his knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself</p>\n<p>again and he knew he was a living man and</p>\n<p>not a dead one. Slowly--slowly--for no reason that he knew</p>\n<p>of--he was \"coming alive\" with the garden.</p>",
        "<p>As the golden summer changed into the deeper golden autumn</p>\n<p>he went to the Lake of Como. There he found</p>\n<p>the loveliness of a dream. He spent his days upon</p>\n<p>the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back</p>\n<p>into the soft thick verdure of the hills and tramped</p>\n<p>until he was tired so that he might sleep. But</p>\n<p>by this time he had begun to sleep better, he</p>",
        "<p>knew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror</p>\n<p>to him.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps,\" he thought, \"my body is growing stronger.\"</p>\n<p>It was growing stronger but--because of the rare peaceful hours</p>\n<p>when his thoughts were changed--his soul was slowly growing stronger,</p>\n<p>too. He began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if</p>\n<p>he should not go home. Now and then he wondered</p>",
        "<p>vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should</p>\n<p>feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted</p>\n<p>bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white</p>\n<p>face while it slept and the black lashes rimmed so</p>\n<p>startlingly the close-shut eyes. He shrank from it.</p>\n<p>One marvel of a day he had walked so far</p>\n<p>that when he returned the moon was high and full</p>",
        "<p>and all the world was purple shadow and silver. The</p>\n<p>stillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful</p>\n<p>that he did not go into the villa he lived</p>\n<p>in. He walked down to a little bowered terrace at</p>\n<p>the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed</p>\n<p>in all the heavenly scents of the night. He felt</p>\n<p>the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew deeper</p>",
        "<p>and deeper until he fell asleep.</p>\n<p>He did not know when he fell asleep and when</p>\n<p>he began to dream; his dream was so real that</p>\n<p>he did not feel as if he were dreaming. He</p>\n<p>remembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had</p>\n<p>thought he was. He thought that as he sat and</p>\n<p>breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened</p>",
        "<p>to the lapping of the water at his feet he</p>\n<p>heard a voice calling. It was sweet and clear and</p>\n<p>happy and far away. It seemed very far, but he</p>\n<p>heard it as distinctly as if it had been at</p>\n<p>his very side.</p>\n<p>\"Archie! Archie! Archie!\" it said, and then again, sweeter and</p>\n<p>clearer than before, \"Archie! Archie!\"</p>",
        "<p>He thought he sprang to his feet not even startled.</p>\n<p>It was such a real voice and it seemed so</p>\n<p>natural that he should hear it.</p>\n<p>\"Lilias! Lilias!\" he answered. \"Lilias! where are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"In the garden,\" it came back like a sound from</p>\n<p>a golden flute. \"In the garden!\"</p>\n<p>And then the dream ended. But he did not awaken.</p>",
        "<p>He slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night.</p>\n<p>When he did awake at last it was brilliant morning</p>\n<p>and a servant was standing staring at him. He was</p>\n<p>an Italian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants</p>\n<p>of the villa were, to accepting without question any strange</p>\n<p>thing his foreign master might do. No one ever knew</p>\n<p>when he would go out or come in or where</p>",
        "<p>he would choose to sleep or if he would roam</p>\n<p>about the garden or lie in the boat on the</p>\n<p>lake all night. The man held a salver with some</p>\n<p>letters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven</p>\n<p>took them. When he had gone away Mr. Craven sat</p>\n<p>a few moments holding them in his hand and looking</p>\n<p>at the lake. His strange calm was still upon him</p>",
        "<p>and something more--a lightness as if the cruel thing which</p>\n<p>had been done had not happened as he thought--as if</p>\n<p>something had changed. He was remembering the dream--the real--real dream.</p>\n<p>\"In the garden!\" he said, wondering at himself. \"In the</p>\n<p>garden! But the door is locked and the key is</p>\n<p>buried deep.\"</p>\n<p>When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later</p>",
        "<p>he saw that the one lying at the top of</p>\n<p>the rest was an English letter and came from Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it</p>\n<p>was not a hand he knew. He opened it, scarcely</p>\n<p>thinking of the writer, but the first words attracted his</p>\n<p>attention at once.</p>\n<p>\"_Dear Sir:_</p>",
        "<p>\"I am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to</p>\n<p>you once on the moor. It was about Miss Mary</p>\n<p>I spoke. I will make bold to speak again. Please,</p>\n<p>sir, I would come home if I was you. I</p>\n<p>think you would be glad to come and--if you will</p>\n<p>excuse me, sir--I think your lady would ask you to</p>\n<p>come if she was here.</p>",
        "<p>\"Your obedient servant, \"SUSAN SOWERBY.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it</p>\n<p>back in its envelope. He kept thinking about the dream.</p>\n<p>\"I will go back to Misselthwaite,\" he said. \"Yes, I'll</p>\n<p>go at once.\"</p>\n<p>And he went through the garden to the villa and</p>\n<p>ordered Pitcher to prepare for his return to England.</p>",
        "<p>* * * * *</p>\n<p>In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and</p>\n<p>on his long railroad journey he found himself thinking of</p>\n<p>his boy as he had never thought in all the</p>\n<p>ten years past. During those years he had only wished</p>\n<p>to forget him. Now, though he did not intend to</p>\n<p>think about him, memories of him constantly drifted into his</p>",
        "<p>mind. He remembered the black days when he had raved</p>\n<p>like a madman because the child was alive and the</p>\n<p>mother was dead. He had refused to see it, and</p>\n<p>when he had gone to look at it at last</p>\n<p>it had been such a weak wretched thing that every</p>\n<p>one had been sure it would die in a few</p>\n<p>days. But to the surprise of those who took care</p>",
        "<p>of it the days passed and it lived and then</p>\n<p>every one believed it would be a deformed and crippled</p>\n<p>creature.</p>\n<p>He had not meant to be a bad father, but</p>\n<p>he had not felt like a father at all. He</p>\n<p>had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had</p>\n<p>shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had</p>",
        "<p>buried himself in his own misery. The first time after</p>\n<p>a year's absence he returned to Misselthwaite and the small</p>\n<p>miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his face</p>\n<p>the great gray eyes with black lashes round them, so</p>\n<p>like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he</p>\n<p>had adored, he could not bear the sight of them</p>\n<p>and turned away pale as death. After that he scarcely</p>",
        "<p>ever saw him except when he was asleep, and all</p>\n<p>he knew of him was that he was a confirmed</p>\n<p>invalid, with a vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper. He could only</p>\n<p>be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being given</p>\n<p>his own way in every detail.</p>\n<p>All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but</p>\n<p>as the train whirled him through mountain passes and golden</p>",
        "<p>plains the man who was \"coming alive\" began to think</p>\n<p>in a new way and he thought long and steadily</p>\n<p>and deeply.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,\" he</p>\n<p>said to himself. \"Ten years is a long time. It</p>\n<p>may be too late to do anything--quite too late. What</p>\n<p>have I been thinking of!\"</p>",
        "<p>Of course this was the wrong Magic--to begin by saying</p>\n<p>\"too late.\" Even Colin could have told him that. But</p>\n<p>he knew nothing of Magic--either black or white. This he</p>\n<p>had yet to learn. He wondered if Susan Sowerby had</p>\n<p>taken courage and written to him only because the motherly</p>\n<p>creature had realized that the boy was much worse--was fatally</p>\n<p>ill. If he had not been under the spell of</p>",
        "<p>the curious calmness which had taken possession of him he</p>\n<p>would have been more wretched than ever. But the calm</p>\n<p>had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.</p>\n<p>Instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he</p>\n<p>actually found he was trying to believe in better things.</p>\n<p>\"Could it be possible that she sees that I may</p>\n<p>be able to do him good and control him?\" he</p>",
        "<p>thought. \"I will go and see her on my way</p>\n<p>to Misselthwaite.\"</p>\n<p>But when on his way across the moor he stopped</p>\n<p>the carriage at the cottage, seven or eight children who</p>\n<p>were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing seven</p>\n<p>or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him that their</p>\n<p>mother had gone to the other side of the moor</p>",
        "<p>early in the morning to help a woman who had</p>\n<p>a new baby. \"Our Dickon,\" they volunteered, was over at</p>\n<p>the Manor working in one of the gardens where he</p>\n<p>went several days each week.</p>\n<p>Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies</p>\n<p>and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own</p>\n<p>particular way, and he awoke to the fact that they</p>",
        "<p>were a healthy likable lot. He smiled at their friendly</p>\n<p>grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and</p>\n<p>gave it to \"our 'Lizabeth Ellen\" who was the oldest.</p>\n<p>\"If you divide that into eight parts there will be</p>\n<p>half a crown for each of you,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he</p>\n<p>drove away, leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps</p>",
        "<p>of joy behind.</p>\n<p>The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a</p>\n<p>soothing thing. Why did it seem to give him a</p>\n<p>sense of home-coming which he had been sure he could</p>\n<p>never feel again--that sense of the beauty of land and</p>\n<p>sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of</p>\n<p>the heart at drawing nearer to the great old house</p>",
        "<p>which had held those of his blood for six hundred</p>\n<p>years? How he had driven away from it the last</p>\n<p>time, shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the</p>\n<p>boy lying in the four-posted bed with the brocaded hangings.</p>\n<p>Was it possible that perhaps he might find him changed</p>\n<p>a little for the better and that he might overcome</p>\n<p>his shrinking from him? How real that dream had been--how</p>",
        "<p>wonderful and clear the voice which called back to him,</p>\n<p>\"In the garden--In the garden!\"</p>\n<p>\"I will try to find the key,\" he said. \"I</p>\n<p>will try to open the door. I must--though I don't</p>\n<p>know why.\"</p>\n<p>When he arrived at the Manor the servants who received</p>\n<p>him with the usual ceremony noticed that he looked better</p>",
        "<p>and that he did not go to the remote rooms</p>\n<p>where he usually lived attended by Pitcher. He went into</p>\n<p>the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock. She came to</p>\n<p>him somewhat excited and curious and flustered.</p>\n<p>\"How is Master Colin, Medlock?\" he inquired.</p>\n<p>\"Well, sir,\" Mrs. Medlock answered, \"he's--he's different, in a manner</p>\n<p>of speaking.\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Worse?\" he suggested.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock really was flushed.</p>\n<p>\"Well, you see, sir,\" she tried to explain, \"neither Dr.</p>\n<p>Craven, nor the nurse, nor me can exactly make him</p>\n<p>out.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why is that?\"</p>\n<p>\"To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better</p>",
        "<p>and he might be changing for the worse. His appetite,</p>\n<p>sir, is past understanding--and his ways--\"</p>\n<p>\"Has he become more--more peculiar?\" her master asked, knitting his</p>\n<p>brows anxiously.</p>\n<p>\"That's it, sir. He's growing very peculiar--when you compare him</p>\n<p>with what he used to be. He used to eat</p>\n<p>nothing and then suddenly he began to eat something enormous--and</p>",
        "<p>then he stopped again all at once and the meals</p>\n<p>were sent back just as they used to be. You</p>\n<p>never knew, sir, perhaps, that out of doors he never</p>\n<p>would let himself be taken. The things we've gone through</p>\n<p>to get him to go out in his chair would</p>\n<p>leave a body trembling like a leaf. He'd throw himself</p>\n<p>into such a state that Dr. Craven said he couldn't</p>",
        "<p>be responsible for forcing him. Well, sir, just without warning--not</p>\n<p>long after one of his worst tantrums he suddenly insisted</p>\n<p>on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and</p>\n<p>Susan Sowerby's boy Dickon that could push his chair. He</p>\n<p>took a fancy to both Miss Mary and Dickon, and</p>\n<p>Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if you'll credit it,</p>\n<p>sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until</p>",
        "<p>night.\"</p>\n<p>\"How does he look?\" was the next question.</p>\n<p>\"If he took his food natural, sir, you'd think he</p>\n<p>was putting on flesh--but we're afraid it may be a</p>\n<p>sort of bloat. He laughs sometimes in a queer way</p>\n<p>when he's alone with Miss Mary. He never used to</p>\n<p>laugh at all. Dr. Craven is coming to see you</p>",
        "<p>at once, if you'll allow him. He never was as</p>\n<p>puzzled in his life.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where is Master Colin now?\" Mr. Craven asked.</p>\n<p>\"In the garden, sir. He's always in the garden--though not</p>\n<p>a human creature is allowed to go near for fear</p>\n<p>they'll look at him.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.</p>",
        "<p>\"In the garden,\" he said, and after he had sent</p>\n<p>Mrs. Medlock away he stood and repeated it again and</p>\n<p>again. \"In the garden!\"</p>\n<p>He had to make an effort to bring himself back</p>\n<p>to the place he was standing in and when he</p>\n<p>felt he was on earth again he turned and went</p>\n<p>out of the room. He took his way, as Mary</p>",
        "<p>had done, through the door in the shrubbery and among</p>\n<p>the laurels and the fountain beds. The fountain was playing</p>\n<p>now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.</p>\n<p>He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk</p>\n<p>by the ivied walls. He did not walk quickly, but</p>\n<p>slowly, and his eyes were on the path. He felt</p>\n<p>as if he were being drawn back to the place</p>",
        "<p>he had so long forsaken, and he did not know</p>\n<p>why. As he drew near to it his step became</p>\n<p>still more slow. He knew where the door was even</p>\n<p>though the ivy hung thick over it--but he did not</p>\n<p>know exactly where it lay--that buried key.</p>\n<p>So he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and</p>\n<p>almost the moment after he had paused he started and</p>",
        "<p>listened--asking himself if he were walking in a dream.</p>\n<p>The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was</p>\n<p>buried under the shrubs, no human being had passed that</p>\n<p>portal for ten lonely years--and yet inside the garden there</p>\n<p>were sounds. They were the sounds of running scuffling feet</p>\n<p>seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they</p>\n<p>were strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices--exclamations and smothered joyous</p>",
        "<p>cries. It seemed actually like the laughter of young things,</p>\n<p>the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to</p>\n<p>be heard but who in a moment or so--as their</p>\n<p>excitement mounted--would burst forth. What in heaven's name was he</p>\n<p>dreaming of--what in heaven's name did he hear? Was he</p>\n<p>losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were</p>\n<p>not for human ears? Was it that the far clear</p>",
        "<p>voice had meant?</p>\n<p>And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the</p>\n<p>sounds forgot to hush themselves. The feet ran faster and</p>\n<p>faster--they were nearing the garden door--there was quick strong young</p>\n<p>breathing and a wild outbreak of laughing shouts which could</p>\n<p>not be contained--and the door in the wall was flung</p>\n<p>wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back, and a</p>",
        "<p>boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing</p>\n<p>the outsider, dashed almost into his arms.</p>\n<p>Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save</p>\n<p>him from falling as a result of his unseeing dash</p>\n<p>against him, and when he held him away to look</p>\n<p>at him in amazement at his being there he truly</p>\n<p>gasped for breath.</p>",
        "<p>He was a tall boy and a handsome one. He</p>\n<p>was glowing with life and his running had sent splendid</p>\n<p>color leaping to his face. He threw the thick hair</p>\n<p>back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange</p>\n<p>gray eyes--eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black</p>\n<p>lashes like a fringe. It was the eyes which made</p>\n<p>Mr. Craven gasp for breath.</p>",
        "<p>\"Who--What? Who!\" he stammered.</p>\n<p>This was not what Colin had expected--this was not what</p>\n<p>he had planned. He had never thought of such a</p>\n<p>meeting. And yet to come dashing out--winning a race--perhaps it</p>\n<p>was even better. He drew himself up to his very</p>\n<p>tallest. Mary, who had been running with him and had</p>\n<p>dashed through the door too, believed that he managed to</p>",
        "<p>make himself look taller than he had ever looked before--inches</p>\n<p>taller.</p>\n<p>\"Father,\" he said, \"I'm Colin. You can't believe it. I</p>\n<p>scarcely can myself. I'm Colin.\"</p>\n<p>Like Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father</p>\n<p>meant when he said hurriedly:</p>\n<p>\"In the garden! In the garden!\"</p>",
        "<p>\"Yes,\" hurried on Colin. \"It was the garden that did</p>\n<p>it--and Mary and Dickon and the creatures--and the Magic. No</p>\n<p>one knows. We kept it to tell you when you</p>\n<p>came. I'm well, I can beat Mary in a race.</p>\n<p>I'm going to be an athlete.\"</p>\n<p>He said it all so like a healthy boy--his face</p>\n<p>flushed, his words tumbling over each other in his eagerness--that</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Craven's soul shook with unbelieving joy.</p>\n<p>Colin put out his hand and laid it on his</p>\n<p>father's arm.</p>\n<p>\"Aren't you glad, Father?\" he ended.</p>\n<p>\"Aren't you glad? I'm going to live forever and ever</p>\n<p>and ever!\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Craven put his hands on both the boy's shoulders</p>",
        "<p>and held him still. He knew he dared not even</p>\n<p>try to speak for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"Take me into the garden, my boy,\" he said at</p>\n<p>last. \"And tell me all about it.\"</p>\n<p>And so they led him in.</p>\n<p>The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple</p>\n<p>and violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side</p>",
        "<p>were sheaves of late lilies standing together--lilies which were white</p>\n<p>or white and ruby. He remembered well when the first</p>\n<p>of them had been planted that just at this season</p>\n<p>of the year their late glories should reveal themselves. Late</p>\n<p>roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening</p>\n<p>the hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that</p>\n<p>one stood in an embowered temple of gold. The newcomer</p>",
        "<p>stood silent just as the children had done when they</p>\n<p>came into its grayness. He looked round and round.</p>\n<p>\"I thought it would be dead,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Mary thought so at first,\" said Colin. \"But it came</p>\n<p>alive.\"</p>\n<p>Then they sat down under their tree--all but Colin, who</p>\n<p>wanted to stand while he told the story.</p>",
        "<p>It was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald</p>\n<p>Craven thought, as it was poured forth in headlong boy</p>\n<p>fashion. Mystery and Magic and wild creatures, the weird midnight</p>\n<p>meeting--the coming of the spring--the passion of insulted pride which</p>\n<p>had dragged the young Rajah to his feet to defy</p>\n<p>old Ben Weatherstaff to his face. The odd companionship, the</p>\n<p>play acting, the great secret so carefully kept. The listener</p>",
        "<p>laughed until tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears</p>\n<p>came into his eyes when he was not laughing. The</p>\n<p>Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable,</p>\n<p>healthy young human thing.</p>\n<p>\"Now,\" he said at the end of the story, \"it</p>\n<p>need not be a secret any more. I dare say</p>\n<p>it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see</p>",
        "<p>me--but I am never going to get into the chair</p>\n<p>again. I shall walk back with you, Father--to the house.\"</p>\n<p>* * * * *</p>\n<p>Ben Weatherstaff's duties rarely took him away from the gardens,</p>\n<p>but on this occasion he made an excuse to carry</p>\n<p>some vegetables to the kitchen and being invited into the</p>\n<p>servants' hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a glass of</p>",
        "<p>beer he was on the spot--as he had hoped to</p>\n<p>be--when the most dramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during</p>\n<p>the present generation actually took place.</p>\n<p>One of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also</p>\n<p>a glimpse of the lawn. Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had</p>\n<p>come from the gardens, hoped that he might have caught</p>\n<p>sight of his master and even by chance of his</p>",
        "<p>meeting with Master Colin.</p>\n<p>\"Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>Ben took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his</p>\n<p>lips with the back of his hand.</p>\n<p>\"Aye, that I did,\" he answered with a shrewdly significant</p>\n<p>air.</p>\n<p>\"Both of them?\" suggested Mrs. Medlock.</p>",
        "<p>\"Both of 'em,\" returned Ben Weatherstaff. \"Thank ye kindly, ma'am,</p>\n<p>I could sup up another mug of it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Together?\" said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in her</p>\n<p>excitement.</p>\n<p>\"Together, ma'am,\" and Ben gulped down half of his new</p>\n<p>mug at one gulp.</p>\n<p>\"Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did</p>",
        "<p>they say to each other?\"</p>\n<p>\"I didna' hear that,\" said Ben, \"along o' only bein'</p>\n<p>on th' step-ladder lookin' over th' wall. But I'll tell</p>\n<p>thee this. There's been things goin' on outside as you</p>\n<p>house people knows nowt about. An' what tha'll find out</p>\n<p>tha'll find out soon.\"</p>\n<p>And it was not two minutes before he swallowed the</p>",
        "<p>last of his beer and waved his mug solemnly toward</p>\n<p>the window which took in through the shrubbery a piece</p>\n<p>of the lawn.</p>\n<p>\"Look there,\" he said, \"if tha's curious. Look what's comin'</p>\n<p>across th' grass.\"</p>\n<p>When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and</p>\n<p>gave a little shriek and every man and woman servant</p>",
        "<p>within hearing bolted across the servants' hall and stood looking</p>\n<p>through the window with their eyes almost starting out of</p>\n<p>their heads.</p>\n<p>Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he</p>\n<p>looked as many of them had never seen him. And</p>\n<p>by his side with his head up in the air</p>\n<p>and his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and</p>",
