        "<h3>Chapter I.]</h3>\n<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession</p>\n<p>of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</p>\n<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his</p>\n<p>first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds</p>\n<p>of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful</p>\n<p>property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>",
        "<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that</p>\n<p>Netherfield Park is let at last?”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>\n<p>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she</p>\n<p>told me all about it.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>\n<p>“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.</p>",
        "<p>“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”</p>\n<p>“He came down to see the place”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>This was invitation enough.</p>\n<p>“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken</p>\n<p>by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came</p>\n<p>down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much</p>",
        "<p>delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is</p>\n<p>to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be</p>\n<p>in the house by the end of next week.”</p>\n<p>“What is his name?”</p>\n<p>“Bingley.”</p>\n<p>“Is he married or single?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or</p>",
        "<p>five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</p>\n<p>“How so? how can it affect them?”</p>\n<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You</p>\n<p>must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</p>\n<p>“Is that his design in settling here?”</p>\n<p>“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he</p>\n<p>_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as</p>",
        "<p>soon as he comes.”</p>\n<p>“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send</p>\n<p>them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are</p>\n<p>as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the</p>\n<p>party.”</p>\n<p>“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but</p>\n<p>I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five</p>",
        "<p>grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”</p>\n<p>“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</p>\n<p>“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into</p>\n<p>the neighbourhood.”</p>\n<p>“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”</p>\n<p>“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would</p>\n<p>be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,</p>",
        "<p>merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new</p>\n<p>comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit</p>\n<p>him, if you do not.”</p>\n<p>“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very</p>\n<p>glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my</p>\n<p>hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though</p>\n<p>I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”</p>",
        "<p>“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the</p>\n<p>others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so</p>\n<p>good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”</p>\n<p>“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are</p>\n<p>all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of</p>\n<p>quickness than her sisters.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take</p>",
        "<p>delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”</p>\n<p>“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They</p>\n<p>are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration</p>\n<p>these twenty years at least.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”</p>\n<p>“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four</p>\n<p>thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”</p>",
        "<p>“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not</p>\n<p>visit them.”</p>\n<p>“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them</p>\n<p>all.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,</p>\n<p>reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had</p>\n<p>been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind</p>",
        "<p>was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,</p>\n<p>little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she</p>\n<p>fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her</p>\n<p>daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>\n<p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He</p>\n<p>had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his</p>\n<p>wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was</p>\n<p>paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following</p>\n<p>manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he</p>\n<p>suddenly addressed her with,--</p>",
        "<p>“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”</p>\n<p>“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,</p>\n<p>resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”</p>\n<p>“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the</p>\n<p>assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”</p>\n<p>“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces</p>\n<p>of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion</p>",
        "<p>of her.”</p>\n<p>“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do</p>\n<p>not depend on her serving you.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain</p>\n<p>herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</p>\n<p>“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little</p>\n<p>compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”</p>",
        "<p>“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times</p>\n<p>them ill.”</p>\n<p>“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When</p>\n<p>is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”</p>\n<p>“To-morrow fortnight.”</p>\n<p>“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till</p>\n<p>the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for</p>",
        "<p>she will not know him herself.”</p>\n<p>“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley to _her_.”</p>\n<p>“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him</p>\n<p>myself; how can you be so teasing?”</p>\n<p>“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly</p>\n<p>very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a</p>",
        "<p>fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after</p>\n<p>all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,</p>\n<p>as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I</p>\n<p>will take it on myself.”</p>\n<p>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,</p>\n<p>nonsense!”</p>\n<p>“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do</p>",
        "<p>you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on</p>\n<p>them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,</p>\n<p>Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read</p>\n<p>great books, and make extracts.”</p>\n<p>Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.</p>\n<p>“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.</p>\n<p>Bingley.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.</p>\n<p>“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I</p>\n<p>had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on</p>\n<p>him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we</p>\n<p>cannot escape the acquaintance now.”</p>\n<p>The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy</p>",
        "<p>was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the</p>\n<p>while.</p>\n<p>“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should</p>\n<p>persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to</p>\n<p>neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a</p>\n<p>good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a</p>\n<p>word about it till now.”</p>",
        "<p>“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,</p>\n<p>as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.</p>\n<p>“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was</p>\n<p>shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;</p>\n<p>or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so</p>\n<p>pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but</p>\n<p>for your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_</p>",
        "<p>the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next</p>\n<p>ball.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the</p>\n<p>youngest, I’m the tallest.”</p>\n<p>The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would</p>\n<p>return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to</p>\n<p>dinner.</p>",
        "<p>“He rode a black horse”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>\n<p>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five</p>\n<p>daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her</p>\n<p>husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him</p>\n<p>in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and</p>\n<p>distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at</p>\n<p>last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,</p>",
        "<p>Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been</p>\n<p>delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely</p>\n<p>agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly</p>\n<p>with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of</p>\n<p>dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively</p>\n<p>hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.</p>\n<p>“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”</p>",
        "<p>said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well</p>\n<p>married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”</p>\n<p>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten</p>\n<p>minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being</p>\n<p>admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard</p>\n<p>much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more</p>\n<p>fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper</p>",
        "<p>window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.</p>\n<p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her</p>\n<p>housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley</p>\n<p>was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to</p>\n<p>accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite</p>\n<p>disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town</p>",
        "<p>so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that</p>\n<p>he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never</p>\n<p>settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a</p>\n<p>little by starting the idea of his</p>\n<p>“When the Party entered”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a</p>",
        "<p>report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and</p>\n<p>seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a</p>\n<p>number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing</p>\n<p>that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,</p>\n<p>his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the</p>\n<p>assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his</p>\n<p>two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant</p>\n<p>countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,</p>\n<p>with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely</p>\n<p>looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention</p>\n<p>of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and</p>\n<p>the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after</p>\n<p>his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen</p>",
        "<p>pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was</p>\n<p>much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great</p>\n<p>admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust</p>\n<p>which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be</p>\n<p>proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his</p>\n<p>large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,</p>\n<p>disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his</p>",
        "<p>friend.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal</p>\n<p>people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,</p>\n<p>was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one</p>\n<p>himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for</p>\n<p>themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced</p>\n<p>only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being</p>",
        "<p>introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in</p>\n<p>walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.</p>\n<p>His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in</p>\n<p>the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.</p>\n<p>Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of</p>\n<p>his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his</p>\n<p>having slighted one of her daughters.</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit</p>\n<p>down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been</p>\n<p>standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his</p>\n<p>friend to join it.</p>\n<p>“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you</p>\n<p>standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better</p>",
        "<p>dance.”</p>\n<p>“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am</p>\n<p>particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it</p>\n<p>would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not</p>\n<p>another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to</p>\n<p>stand up with.”</p>\n<p>“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a</p>",
        "<p>kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my</p>\n<p>life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,</p>\n<p>uncommonly pretty.”</p>\n<p>“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</p>\n<p>“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one</p>\n<p>of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I</p>",
        "<p>dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”</p>\n<p>“She is tolerable”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,</p>\n<p>“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no</p>\n<p>humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted</p>",
        "<p>by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her</p>\n<p>smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth</p>\n<p>remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,</p>\n<p>however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,</p>\n<p>playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.</p>\n<p>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield</p>\n<p>party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been</p>\n<p>distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her</p>\n<p>mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s</p>\n<p>pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most</p>\n<p>accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been</p>\n<p>fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they</p>",
        "<p>had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good</p>\n<p>spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they</p>\n<p>were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a</p>\n<p>book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a</p>\n<p>good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised</p>\n<p>such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s</p>\n<p>views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he</p>",
        "<p>had a very different story to hear.</p>\n<p>“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most</p>\n<p>delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.</p>\n<p>Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well</p>\n<p>she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with</p>\n<p>her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her</p>\n<p>twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second</p>",
        "<p>time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand</p>\n<p>up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody</p>\n<p>can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going</p>\n<p>down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and</p>\n<p>asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss</p>\n<p>King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane</p>\n<p>again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”</p>",
        "<p>“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,</p>\n<p>“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of</p>\n<p>his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He</p>\n<p>is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never</p>\n<p>in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the</p>\n<p>lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”</p>",
        "<p>Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any</p>\n<p>description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch</p>\n<p>of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some</p>\n<p>exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</p>\n<p>“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not</p>\n<p>suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at</p>\n<p>all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring</p>",
        "<p>him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very</p>\n<p>great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my</p>\n<p>dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>\n<p>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in</p>\n<p>her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much</p>\n<p>she admired him.</p>\n<p>“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,</p>\n<p>good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,</p>\n<p>with such perfect good breeding!”</p>",
        "<p>“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought</p>\n<p>likewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”</p>\n<p>“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I</p>\n<p>did not expect such a compliment.”</p>\n<p>“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between</p>\n<p>us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What</p>\n<p>could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help</p>",
        "<p>seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in</p>\n<p>the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is</p>\n<p>very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a</p>\n<p>stupider person.”</p>\n<p>“Dear Lizzy!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.</p>\n<p>You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable</p>",
        "<p>in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”</p>\n<p>“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak</p>\n<p>what I think.”</p>\n<p>“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_</p>\n<p>good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of</p>\n<p>others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it</p>\n<p>everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the</p>",
        "<p>good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing</p>\n<p>of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,</p>\n<p>too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you</p>\n<p>converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep</p>\n<p>his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming</p>\n<p>neighbour in her.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at</p>\n<p>the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more</p>\n<p>quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and</p>\n<p>with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was</p>\n<p>very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine</p>\n<p>ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the</p>\n<p>power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.</p>",
        "<p>They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private</p>\n<p>seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the</p>\n<p>habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people</p>\n<p>of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of</p>\n<p>themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in</p>\n<p>the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their</p>\n<p>memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been</p>",
        "<p>acquired by trade.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred</p>\n<p>thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,</p>\n<p>but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and</p>\n<p>sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a</p>\n<p>good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those</p>\n<p>who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the</p>",
        "<p>remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to</p>\n<p>purchase.</p>\n<p>His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but</p>\n<p>though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no</p>\n<p>means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had</p>\n<p>married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider</p>\n<p>his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of</p>",
        "<p>age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to</p>\n<p>look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an</p>\n<p>hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied</p>\n<p>with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.</p>\n<p>Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a</p>\n<p>great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the</p>\n<p>easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition</p>",
        "<p>could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he</p>\n<p>never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley</p>\n<p>had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In</p>\n<p>understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means</p>\n<p>deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,</p>\n<p>reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not</p>\n<p>inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley</p>",
        "<p>was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually</p>\n<p>giving offence.</p>\n<p>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently</p>\n<p>characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier</p>\n<p>girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;</p>\n<p>there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted</p>\n<p>with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel</p>",
        "<p>more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people</p>\n<p>in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had</p>\n<p>felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or</p>\n<p>pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too</p>\n<p>much.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired</p>\n<p>her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom</p>",
        "<p>they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore</p>\n<p>established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such</p>\n<p>commendation to think of her as he chose.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>\n<p>Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets</p>\n<p>were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade</p>\n<p>in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the</p>\n<p>honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The</p>\n<p>distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a</p>\n<p>disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;</p>",
        "<p>and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about</p>\n<p>a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he</p>\n<p>could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by</p>\n<p>business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,</p>\n<p>though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the</p>\n<p>contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,</p>\n<p>friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him</p>",
        "<p>courteous.</p>\n<p>Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a</p>\n<p>valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest</p>\n<p>of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s intimate friend.</p>\n<p>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a</p>\n<p>ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly</p>",
        "<p>brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.</p>\n<p>“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil</p>\n<p>self-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”</p>\n<p>“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be</p>\n<p>sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he</p>\n<p>_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something</p>",
        "<p>about Mr. Robinson.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not</p>\n<p>I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton</p>\n<p>assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty</p>\n<p>women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his</p>\n<p>answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,</p>\n<p>beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”</p>",
        "<p>“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as</p>\n<p>if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”</p>\n<p>“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said</p>\n<p>Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,</p>\n<p>is he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”</p>\n<p>“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his</p>\n<p>ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite</p>",
        "<p>a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he</p>\n<p>sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.</p>\n<p>“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”</p>\n<p>“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he</p>\n<p>could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being</p>",
        "<p>spoke to.”</p>\n<p>“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless</p>\n<p>among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably</p>\n<p>agreeable.”</p>\n<p>“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very</p>\n<p>agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it</p>\n<p>was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had</p>",
        "<p>heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come</p>\n<p>to the ball in a hack chaise.”</p>\n<p>“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I</p>\n<p>wish he had danced with Eliza.”</p>\n<p>“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,</p>\n<p>if I were you.”</p>\n<p>“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”</p>",
        "<p>“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride</p>\n<p>often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so</p>\n<p>very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,</p>\n<p>should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_</p>\n<p>to be proud.”</p>\n<p>“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive</p>\n<p>_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”</p>",
        "<p>“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her</p>\n<p>reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have</p>\n<p>ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human</p>\n<p>nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us</p>\n<p>who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some</p>\n<p>quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different</p>\n<p>things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be</p>",
        "<p>proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of</p>\n<p>ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”</p>\n<p>“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his</p>\n<p>sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of</p>\n<p>foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”</p>\n<p>“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle</p>",
        "<p>directly.”</p>\n<p>The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she</p>\n<p>would; and the argument ended only with the visit.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>\n<p>The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit</p>\n<p>was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the</p>\n<p>good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was</p>\n<p>found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,</p>\n<p>a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the</p>\n<p>two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest</p>",
        "<p>pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of</p>\n<p>everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;</p>\n<p>though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,</p>\n<p>in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It</p>\n<p>was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and</p>\n<p>to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference</p>\n<p>which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a</p>",
        "<p>way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it</p>\n<p>was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane</p>\n<p>united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an</p>\n<p>uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the</p>\n<p>suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss</p>\n<p>Lucas.</p>\n<p>“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose</p>",
        "<p>on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be</p>\n<p>so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill</p>\n<p>from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and</p>\n<p>it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the</p>\n<p>dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every</p>\n<p>attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all</p>\n<p>_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are</p>",
        "<p>very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without</p>\n<p>encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_</p>\n<p>affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he</p>\n<p>may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”</p>\n<p>“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can</p>\n<p>perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to</p>\n<p>discover it too.”</p>",
        "<p>“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”</p>\n<p>“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal</p>\n<p>it, he must find it out.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane</p>\n<p>meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they</p>\n<p>always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that</p>\n<p>every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should</p>",
        "<p>therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his</p>\n<p>attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling</p>\n<p>in love as much as she chooses.”</p>\n<p>“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in</p>\n<p>question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined</p>\n<p>to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But</p>\n<p>these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she</p>",
        "<p>cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its</p>\n<p>reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four</p>\n<p>dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,</p>\n<p>and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite</p>\n<p>enough to make her understand his character.”</p>\n<p>“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might</p>\n<p>only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must</p>",
        "<p>remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four</p>\n<p>evenings may do a great deal.”</p>\n<p>“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both</p>\n<p>like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other</p>\n<p>leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if</p>\n<p>she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a</p>",
        "<p>chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a</p>\n<p>twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If</p>\n<p>the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or</p>\n<p>ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the</p>\n<p>least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to</p>\n<p>have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as</p>\n<p>possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your</p>",
        "<p>life.”</p>\n<p>“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not</p>\n<p>sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”</p>\n<p>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth</p>\n<p>was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some</p>\n<p>interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely</p>\n<p>allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the</p>",
        "<p>ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no</p>\n<p>sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had</p>\n<p>hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered</p>\n<p>uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To</p>\n<p>this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had</p>\n<p>detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry</p>\n<p>in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and</p>",
        "<p>pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those</p>\n<p>of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of</p>\n<p>this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made</p>\n<p>himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough</p>\n<p>to dance with.</p>\n<p>He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing</p>\n<p>with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so</p>",
        "<p>drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were</p>\n<p>assembled.</p>\n<p>“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my</p>\n<p>conversation with Colonel Forster?”</p>\n<p>“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”</p>\n<p>“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see</p>\n<p>what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by</p>",
        "<p>being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”</p>\n<p>Allen._]]</p>\n<p>On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have</p>\n<p>any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such</p>\n<p>a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she</p>\n<p>turned to him and said,--</p>\n<p>“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well</p>",
        "<p>just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at</p>\n<p>Meryton?”</p>\n<p>“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady</p>\n<p>energetic.”</p>\n<p>“You are severe on us.”</p>\n<p>“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going</p>\n<p>to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”</p>",
        "<p>“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me</p>\n<p>to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a</p>\n<p>musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would</p>\n<p>really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of</p>\n<p>hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,</p>\n<p>she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing</p>\n<p>at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is</p>",
        "<p>of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and</p>\n<p>I shall keep mine to swell my song.”</p>\n<p>Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song</p>\n<p>or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she</p>\n<p>would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her</p>\n<p>sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in</p>\n<p>the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always</p>",
        "<p>impatient for display.</p>\n<p>Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her</p>\n<p>application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited</p>\n<p>manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she</p>\n<p>had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with</p>\n<p>much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the</p>\n<p>end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by</p>",
        "<p>Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with</p>\n<p>some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in</p>\n<p>dancing at one end of the room.</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of</p>\n<p>passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too</p>\n<p>much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas</p>\n<p>was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--</p>",
        "<p>“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is</p>\n<p>nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first</p>\n<p>refinements of polished societies.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst</p>\n<p>the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”</p>\n<p>Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he</p>\n<p>continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt</p>",
        "<p>not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”</p>\n<p>“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do</p>\n<p>you often dance at St. James’s?”</p>\n<p>“Never, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”</p>\n<p>“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”</p>",
        "<p>“You have a house in town, I conclude?”</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy bowed.</p>\n<p>“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of</p>\n<p>superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of</p>\n<p>London would agree with Lady Lucas.”</p>\n<p>He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to</p>\n<p>make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was</p>",
        "<p>struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to</p>\n<p>her,--</p>\n<p>“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow</p>\n<p>me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You</p>\n<p>cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”</p>\n<p>And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though</p>\n<p>extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly</p>",
        "<p>drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--</p>\n<p>“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you</p>\n<p>not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of</p>\n<p>her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at</p>\n<p>all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.</p>\n<p>“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me</p>",
        "<p>the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the</p>\n<p>amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us</p>\n<p>for one half hour.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.</p>\n<p>“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we</p>\n<p>cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a</p>\n<p>partner?”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured</p>\n<p>her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some</p>\n<p>complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--</p>\n<p>“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”</p>\n<p>“I should imagine not.”</p>\n<p>“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many</p>\n<p>evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of</p>",
        "<p>your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the</p>\n<p>noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these</p>\n<p>people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”</p>\n<p>“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more</p>\n<p>agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure</p>\n<p>which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he</p>",
        "<p>would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--</p>\n<p>“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”</p>\n<p>“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.</p>\n<p>How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you</p>\n<p>joy?”</p>\n<p>“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s</p>",
        "<p>imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love</p>\n<p>to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”</p>\n<p>“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as</p>\n<p>absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and</p>\n<p>of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”</p>\n<p>He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to</p>\n<p>entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her</p>",
        "<p>that all was safe, her wit flowed along.</p>\n<p>“A note for Miss Bennet”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>\n<p>Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two</p>\n<p>thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,</p>\n<p>in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s</p>\n<p>fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply</p>\n<p>the deficiency of his.

        "<p>She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their</p>\n<p>father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in</p>\n<p>London in a respectable line of trade.</p>\n<p>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most</p>\n<p>convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted</p>\n<p>thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and</p>\n<p>to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,</p>",
        "<p>Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:</p>\n<p>their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing</p>\n<p>better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning</p>\n<p>hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of</p>\n<p>news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn</p>\n<p>some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both</p>\n<p>with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in</p>",
        "<p>the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was</p>\n<p>the head-quarters.</p>\n<p>Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting</p>\n<p>intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the</p>\n<p>officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,</p>\n<p>and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips</p>\n<p>visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity</p>",
        "<p>unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.</p>\n<p>Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their</p>\n<p>mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of</p>\n<p>an ensign.</p>\n<p>After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.</p>\n<p>Bennet coolly observed,--</p>\n<p>“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two</p>",
        "<p>of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but</p>\n<p>I am now convinced.”</p>\n<p>Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect</p>\n<p>indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and</p>\n<p>her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the</p>\n<p>next morning to London.</p>\n<p>“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so</p>",
        "<p>ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly</p>\n<p>of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”</p>\n<p>“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”</p>\n<p>“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”</p>\n<p>“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I</p>\n<p>had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must</p>\n<p>so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly</p>",
        "<p>foolish.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of</p>\n<p>their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will</p>\n<p>not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I</p>\n<p>liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my</p>\n<p>heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,</p>\n<p>should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought</p>",
        "<p>Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in</p>\n<p>his regimentals.”</p>\n<p>“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain</p>\n<p>Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first</p>\n<p>came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a</p>\n<p>note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited</p>",
        "<p>for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was</p>\n<p>eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--</p>\n<p>“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,</p>\n<p>Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”</p>\n<p>“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.</p>\n<p>/* NIND “My dear friend, */</p>\n<p>“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and</p>",
        "<p>me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our</p>\n<p>lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never</p>\n<p>end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of</p>\n<p>this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.</p>\n<p>Yours ever,</p>\n<p>“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”</p>\n<p>“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of</p>",
        "<p>_that_.”</p>\n<p>“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”</p>\n<p>“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.</p>\n<p>“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to</p>\n<p>rain; and then you must stay all night.”</p>\n<p>“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that</p>\n<p>they would not offer to send her home.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;</p>\n<p>and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”</p>\n<p>“I had much rather go in the coach.”</p>\n<p>“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are</p>\n<p>wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”</p>\n<p>“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”</p>\n<p>“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose</p>",
        "<p>will be answered.”</p>\n<p>She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses</p>\n<p>were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her</p>\n<p>mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad</p>\n<p>day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it</p>\n<p>rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was</p>\n<p>delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;</p>",
        "<p>Jane certainly could not come back.</p>\n<p>“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than</p>\n<p>once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next</p>\n<p>morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her</p>\n<p>contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield</p>\n<p>brought the following note for Elizabeth:--</p>\n<p>/* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */</p>",
        "<p>“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be</p>\n<p>imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will</p>\n<p>not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on</p>\n<p>my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear</p>\n<p>of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a</p>\n<p>headache, there is not much the matter with me.</p>\n<p>“Yours, etc.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note</p>\n<p>aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she</p>\n<p>should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little</p>\n<p>trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays</p>\n<p>there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the</p>",
        "<p>carriage.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the</p>\n<p>carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was</p>\n<p>her only alternative. She declared her resolution.</p>\n<p>“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a</p>\n<p>thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get</p>\n<p>there.”</p>",
        "<p>“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”</p>\n<p>“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the</p>\n<p>horses?”</p>\n<p>“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,</p>\n<p>when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”</p>\n<p>“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every</p>\n<p>impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,</p>",
        "<p>exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”</p>\n<p>“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n<p>“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may</p>\n<p>see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”</p>\n<p>In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one</p>",
        "<p>of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing</p>\n<p>field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing</p>\n<p>over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last</p>\n<p>within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face</p>\n<p>glowing with the warmth of exercise.</p>\n<p>She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were</p>\n<p>assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.</p>",
        "<p>That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such</p>\n<p>dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt</p>\n<p>for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their</p>\n<p>brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was</p>\n<p>good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst</p>\n<p>nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the</p>",
        "<p>brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to</p>\n<p>the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was</p>\n<p>thinking only of his breakfast.</p>\n<p>Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss</p>\n<p>Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well</p>\n<p>enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her</p>\n<p>immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving</p>",
        "<p>alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed</p>\n<p>for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,</p>\n<p>however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,</p>\n<p>could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the</p>\n<p>extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth</p>",
        "<p>began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and</p>\n<p>solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having</p>\n<p>examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a</p>\n<p>violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;</p>\n<p>advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice</p>\n<p>was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head</p>\n<p>ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were</p>",
        "<p>the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact</p>\n<p>nothing to do elsewhere.</p>\n<p>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very</p>\n<p>unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only</p>\n<p>wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern</p>\n<p>at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer</p>\n<p>of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the</p>",
        "<p>present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was</p>\n<p>despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring</p>\n<p>back a supply of clothes.</p>\n<p>“The Apothecary came”</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>“covering a screen”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>\n<p>At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then</p>\n<p>poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the</p>\n<p>much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very</p>\n<p>favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing</p>\n<p>this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how</p>",
        "<p>shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked</p>\n<p>being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their</p>\n<p>indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored</p>\n<p>Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.</p>\n<p>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could</p>\n<p>regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his</p>\n<p>attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling</p>",
        "<p>herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the</p>\n<p>others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was</p>\n<p>engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.</p>\n<p>Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to</p>\n<p>eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain</p>\n<p>dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.</p>\n<p>When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley</p>",
        "<p>began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were</p>\n<p>pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:</p>\n<p>she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst</p>\n<p>thought the same, and added,--</p>\n<p>“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent</p>\n<p>walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really</p>\n<p>looked almost wild.”</p>",
        "<p>“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very</p>\n<p>nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the</p>\n<p>country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep</p>\n<p>in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to</p>\n<p>hide it not doing its office.”</p>\n<p>“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was</p>",
        "<p>all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well</p>\n<p>when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite</p>\n<p>escaped my notice.”</p>\n<p>“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am</p>\n<p>inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such</p>\n<p>an exhibition.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly not.”</p>",
        "<p>“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,</p>\n<p>above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by</p>\n<p>it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,</p>\n<p>a most country-town indifference to decorum.”</p>\n<p>“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said</p>\n<p>Bingley.</p>\n<p>“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,</p>",
        "<p>“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine</p>\n<p>eyes.”</p>\n<p>“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A</p>\n<p>short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--</p>\n<p>“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet</p>\n<p>girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such</p>\n<p>a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no</p>",
        "<p>chance of it.”</p>\n<p>“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in</p>\n<p>Meryton?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”</p>\n<p>“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.</p>\n<p>“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it</p>\n<p>would not make them one jot less agreeable.”</p>",
        "<p>“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any</p>\n<p>consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.</p>\n<p>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their</p>\n<p>hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of</p>\n<p>their dear friend’s vulgar relations.</p>\n<p>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on</p>\n<p>leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.</p>",
        "<p>She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till</p>\n<p>late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and</p>\n<p>when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go</p>\n<p>down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole</p>\n<p>party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting</p>\n<p>them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the</p>\n<p>excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay</p>",
        "<p>below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.</p>\n<p>“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”</p>\n<p>“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great</p>\n<p>reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”</p>\n<p>“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I</p>\n<p>am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”</p>\n<p>“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and</p>",
        "<p>I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table</p>\n<p>where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her</p>\n<p>others; all that his library afforded.</p>\n<p>“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own</p>\n<p>credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more</p>\n<p>than I ever looked into.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those</p>\n<p>in the room.</p>\n<p>“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left</p>\n<p>so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at</p>\n<p>Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”</p>\n<p>“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many</p>\n<p>generations.”</p>",
        "<p>“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying</p>\n<p>books.”</p>\n<p>“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as</p>\n<p>these.”</p>\n<p>“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of</p>\n<p>that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be</p>\n<p>half as delightful as Pemberley.”</p>",
        "<p>“I wish it may.”</p>\n<p>“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that</p>\n<p>neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a</p>\n<p>finer county in England than Derbyshire.”</p>\n<p>“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”</p>\n<p>“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”</p>\n<p>“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get</p>",
        "<p>Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little</p>\n<p>attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near</p>\n<p>the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest</p>\n<p>sister, to observe the game.</p>\n<p>“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will</p>\n<p>she be as tall as I am?”</p>",
        "<p>“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or</p>\n<p>rather taller.”</p>\n<p>“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me</p>\n<p>so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished</p>\n<p>for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”</p>\n<p>“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience</p>\n<p>to be so very accomplished as they all are.”</p>",
        "<p>“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and</p>\n<p>net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am</p>\n<p>sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without</p>\n<p>being informed that she was very accomplished.”</p>\n<p>“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has</p>\n<p>too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no</p>",
        "<p>otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very</p>\n<p>far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I</p>\n<p>cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my</p>\n<p>acquaintance that are really accomplished.”</p>\n<p>“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.</p>\n<p>“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your</p>\n<p>idea of an accomplished woman.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really</p>\n<p>esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met</p>\n<p>with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,</p>\n<p>dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all</p>\n<p>this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of</p>\n<p>walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word</p>",
        "<p>will be but half deserved.”</p>\n<p>“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add</p>\n<p>something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive</p>\n<p>reading.”</p>\n<p>“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.</p>\n<p>I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”</p>\n<p>“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all</p>",
        "<p>this?”</p>\n<p>“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and</p>\n<p>application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her</p>\n<p>implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who</p>\n<p>answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with</p>\n<p>bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all</p>",
        "<p>conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is</p>\n<p>one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other</p>\n<p>sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it</p>\n<p>succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”</p>\n<p>“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,</p>",
        "<p>“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend</p>\n<p>to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is</p>\n<p>despicable.”</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to</p>\n<p>continue the subject.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and</p>\n<p>that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for</p>",
        "<p>immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could</p>\n<p>be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most</p>\n<p>eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so</p>\n<p>unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled</p>\n<p>that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet</p>\n<p>were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters</p>\n<p>declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,</p>",
        "<p>however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to</p>\n<p>his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every</p>\n<p>possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.</p>\n<p>M^{rs} Bennet and her two youngest girls</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the</p>\n<p>morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the</p>\n<p>inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,</p>\n<p>and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his</p>\n<p>sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a</p>\n<p>note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her</p>",
        "<p>own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and</p>\n<p>its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her</p>\n<p>two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.</p>\n<p>Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been</p>\n<p>very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was</p>\n<p>not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her</p>\n<p>restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She</p>",
        "<p>would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried</p>\n<p>home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think</p>\n<p>it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss</p>\n<p>Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all</p>\n<p>attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes</p>\n<p>that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.</p>\n<p>“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be</p>",
        "<p>moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass</p>\n<p>a little longer on your kindness.”</p>\n<p>“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am</p>\n<p>sure, will not hear of her removal.”</p>\n<p>“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,</p>\n<p>“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she</p>\n<p>remains with us.”</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.</p>\n<p>“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not</p>\n<p>know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a</p>\n<p>vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is</p>\n<p>always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest</p>\n<p>temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to</p>\n<p>_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect</p>",
        "<p>over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is</p>\n<p>equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I</p>\n<p>hope, though you have but a short lease.”</p>\n<p>“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I</p>\n<p>should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five</p>\n<p>minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”</p>\n<p>“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.</p>",
        "<p>“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.</p>\n<p>“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”</p>\n<p>“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen</p>\n<p>through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”</p>\n<p>“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,</p>\n<p>intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”</p>\n<p>“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in</p>",
        "<p>the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”</p>\n<p>“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were</p>\n<p>a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”</p>\n<p>“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at</p>\n<p>least that advantage.”</p>\n<p>“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for</p>\n<p>such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and</p>",
        "<p>unvarying society.”</p>\n<p>“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be</p>\n<p>observed in them for ever.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a</p>\n<p>country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_</p>\n<p>going on in the country as in town.”</p>\n<p>Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,</p>",
        "<p>turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete</p>\n<p>victory over him, continued her triumph,--</p>\n<p>“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for</p>\n<p>my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal</p>\n<p>pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”</p>\n<p>“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and</p>\n<p>when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their</p>",
        "<p>advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”</p>\n<p>“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that</p>\n<p>gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing</p>\n<p>at all.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her</p>\n<p>mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not</p>\n<p>such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which</p>",
        "<p>you must acknowledge to be true.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with</p>\n<p>many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few</p>\n<p>neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”</p>\n<p>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his</p>\n<p>countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of</p>",
        "<p>saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if</p>\n<p>Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.</p>\n<p>“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir</p>\n<p>William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so</p>\n<p>genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_</p>\n<p>is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very</p>\n<p>important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”</p>",
        "<p>“Did Charlotte dine with you?”</p>\n<p>“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For</p>\n<p>my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own</p>\n<p>work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to</p>\n<p>judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I</p>\n<p>assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think</p>\n<p>Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”</p>",
        "<p>“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.</p>\n<p>“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself</p>\n<p>has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast</p>\n<p>of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody</p>\n<p>better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own</p>\n<p>partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my</p>\n<p>brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my</p>",
        "<p>sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.</p>\n<p>But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he</p>\n<p>wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”</p>\n<p>“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has</p>\n<p>been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first</p>\n<p>discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”</p>\n<p>“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.</p>",
        "<p>“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is</p>\n<p>strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I</p>\n<p>am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”</p>\n<p>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth</p>\n<p>tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to</p>\n<p>speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to</p>",
        "<p>Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was</p>\n<p>unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be</p>\n<p>civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,</p>\n<p>indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and</p>\n<p>soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of</p>\n<p>her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to</p>\n<p>each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the</p>",
        "<p>youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming</p>\n<p>into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</p>\n<p>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion</p>\n<p>and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose</p>\n<p>affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high</p>\n<p>animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the</p>\n<p>attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her</p>",
        "<p>own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was</p>\n<p>very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the</p>\n<p>ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be</p>\n<p>the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer</p>\n<p>to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.</p>\n<p>“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when</p>\n<p>your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of</p>",
        "<p>the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”</p>\n<p>Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to</p>\n<p>wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter</p>\n<p>would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she</p>\n<p>added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel</p>\n<p>Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned</p>",
        "<p>instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the</p>\n<p>remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,</p>\n<p>could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of</p>\n<p>all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>\n<p>The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss</p>\n<p>Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who</p>\n<p>continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined</p>\n<p>their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching</p>\n<p>the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by</p>",
        "<p>messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and</p>\n<p>Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in</p>\n<p>attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual</p>\n<p>commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness</p>\n<p>of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern</p>\n<p>with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was</p>",
        "<p>exactly in unison with her opinion of each.</p>\n<p>“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”</p>\n<p>He made no answer.</p>\n<p>“You write uncommonly fast.”</p>\n<p>“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”</p>\n<p>“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a</p>\n<p>year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”</p>",
        "<p>“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”</p>\n<p>“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”</p>\n<p>“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”</p>\n<p>“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend</p>\n<p>pens remarkably well.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”</p>\n<p>“How can you contrive to write so even?”</p>",
        "<p>He was silent.</p>\n<p>“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,</p>\n<p>and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful</p>\n<p>little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss</p>\n<p>Grantley’s.”</p>\n<p>“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At</p>\n<p>present I have not room to do them justice.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you</p>\n<p>always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”</p>\n<p>“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me</p>\n<p>to determine.”</p>\n<p>“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with</p>\n<p>ease cannot write ill.”</p>\n<p>“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her</p>",
        "<p>brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much</p>\n<p>for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”</p>\n<p>“My style of writing is very different from yours.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way</p>\n<p>imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”</p>\n<p>“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which</p>\n<p>means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”</p>",
        "<p>“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”</p>\n<p>“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of</p>\n<p>humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an</p>\n<p>indirect boast.”</p>\n<p>“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”</p>\n<p>“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in</p>\n<p>writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of</p>",
        "<p>thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you</p>\n<p>think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with</p>\n<p>quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any</p>\n<p>attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield</p>\n<p>you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of</p>\n<p>panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very</p>",
        "<p>laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business</p>\n<p>undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”</p>\n<p>“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the</p>\n<p>foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I</p>\n<p>believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this</p>\n<p>moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless</p>\n<p>precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”</p>",
        "<p>“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you</p>\n<p>would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as</p>\n<p>dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were</p>\n<p>mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay</p>\n<p>till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not</p>\n<p>go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”</p>\n<p>“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did</p>",
        "<p>not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much</p>\n<p>more than he did himself.”</p>\n<p>“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my</p>\n<p>friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am</p>\n<p>afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means</p>\n<p>intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a</p>\n<p>circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I</p>",
        "<p>could.”</p>\n<p>“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention</p>\n<p>as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”</p>\n<p>“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for</p>\n<p>himself.”</p>\n<p>“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,</p>\n<p>but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to</p>",
        "<p>stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,</p>\n<p>that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and</p>\n<p>the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering</p>\n<p>one argument in favour of its propriety.”</p>\n<p>“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit</p>\n<p>with you.”</p>\n<p>“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of</p>",
        "<p>either.”</p>\n<p>“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of</p>\n<p>friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make</p>\n<p>one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason</p>\n<p>one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have</p>\n<p>supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the</p>\n<p>circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour</p>",
        "<p>thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,</p>\n<p>where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no</p>\n<p>very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying</p>\n<p>with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”</p>\n<p>“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange</p>\n<p>with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to</p>\n<p>appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting</p>",
        "<p>between the parties?”</p>\n<p>“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not</p>\n<p>forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more</p>\n<p>weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure</p>\n<p>you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with</p>\n<p>myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not</p>\n<p>know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in</p>",
        "<p>particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,</p>\n<p>when he has nothing to do.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was</p>\n<p>rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly</p>\n<p>resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her</p>\n<p>brother for talking such nonsense.</p>\n<p>“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,</p>",
        "<p>and want to silence this.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss</p>\n<p>Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very</p>\n<p>thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”</p>\n<p>“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy had much better finish his letter.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.</p>",
        "<p>When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth</p>\n<p>for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to</p>\n<p>the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the</p>\n<p>way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she</p>\n<p>seated herself.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books</p>",
        "<p>that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed</p>\n<p>on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of</p>\n<p>admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because</p>\n<p>he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,</p>\n<p>at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her</p>\n<p>more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in</p>\n<p>any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked</p>",
        "<p>him too little to care for his approbation.</p>\n<p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a</p>\n<p>lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, said to her,--</p>\n<p>“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an</p>\n<p>opportunity of dancing a reel?”</p>\n<p>She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some</p>",
        "<p>surprise at her silence.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately</p>\n<p>determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’</p>\n<p>that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always</p>\n<p>delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of</p>\n<p>their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell</p>\n<p>you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you</p>",
        "<p>dare.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed I do not dare.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his</p>\n<p>gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her</p>\n<p>manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had</p>\n<p>never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really</p>\n<p>believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he</p>",
        "<p>should be in some danger.</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great</p>\n<p>anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some</p>\n<p>assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of</p>\n<p>their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.</p>\n<p>“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the</p>",
        "<p>next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this</p>\n<p>desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;</p>\n<p>and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after</p>\n<p>the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to</p>\n<p>check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,</p>\n<p>which your lady possesses.”</p>\n<p>“No, no; stay where you are”</p>",
        "<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”</p>\n<p>“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed</p>\n<p>in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the</p>\n<p>judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different</p>\n<p>lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it</p>\n<p>taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”</p>",
        "<p>“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their</p>\n<p>colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be</p>\n<p>copied.”</p>\n<p>At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth herself.</p>\n<p>“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some</p>\n<p>confusion, lest they had been overheard.</p>",
        "<p>“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without</p>\n<p>telling us that you were coming out.”</p>\n<p>Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk</p>\n<p>by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,</p>\n<p>and immediately said,--</p>\n<p>“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the</p>\n<p>avenue.”</p>",
        "<p>But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,</p>\n<p>laughingly answered,--</p>\n<p>“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to</p>\n<p>uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a</p>\n<p>fourth. Good-bye.”</p>\n<p>She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of</p>\n<p>being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered</p>",
        "<p>as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.</p>\n<p>“Piling up the fire”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>\n<p>When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and</p>\n<p>seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,</p>\n<p>where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of</p>\n<p>pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were</p>\n<p>during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers</p>\n<p>of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment</p>",
        "<p>with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their</p>\n<p>acquaintance with spirit.</p>\n<p>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had</p>\n<p>something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed</p>\n<p>himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst</p>\n<p>also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness</p>",
        "<p>and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and</p>\n<p>attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she</p>\n<p>should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,</p>\n<p>to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the</p>\n<p>door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great</p>\n<p>delight.</p>",
        "<p>When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the</p>\n<p>card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open</p>\n<p>petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the</p>\n<p>silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.</p>\n<p>Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the</p>\n<p>sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;</p>",
        "<p>and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and</p>\n<p>rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss</p>\n<p>Bennet.</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was</p>\n<p>perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She</p>\n<p>could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her</p>",
        "<p>question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be</p>\n<p>amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the</p>\n<p>second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it</p>\n<p>is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no</p>\n<p>enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a</p>\n<p>book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not</p>\n<p>an excellent library.”</p>",
        "<p>No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and</p>\n<p>cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing</p>\n<p>her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly</p>\n<p>towards him and said,--</p>\n<p>“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at</p>\n<p>Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult</p>\n<p>the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not</p>",
        "<p>some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a</p>\n<p>pleasure.”</p>\n<p>“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he</p>\n<p>chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled</p>\n<p>thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send</p>\n<p>round my cards.”</p>\n<p>“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were</p>",
        "<p>carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably</p>\n<p>tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much</p>\n<p>more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the</p>\n<p>day.”</p>\n<p>“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be</p>\n<p>near so much like a ball.”</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about</p>",
        "<p>the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at</p>\n<p>whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the</p>\n<p>desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,</p>\n<p>turning to Elizabeth, said,--</p>\n<p>“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a</p>\n<p>turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so</p>\n<p>long in one attitude.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley</p>\n<p>succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked</p>\n<p>up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as</p>\n<p>Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was</p>\n<p>directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that</p>\n<p>he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down</p>\n<p>the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would</p>",
        "<p>interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his</p>\n<p>meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.</p>\n<p>“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be</p>\n<p>severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask</p>\n<p>nothing about it.”</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in</p>\n<p>anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his</p>",
        "<p>two motives.</p>\n<p>“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon</p>\n<p>as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing</p>\n<p>the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret</p>\n<p>affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures</p>\n<p>appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be</p>\n<p>completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better</p>",
        "<p>as I sit by the fire.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so</p>\n<p>abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We</p>\n<p>can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate</p>\n<p>as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”</p>\n<p>“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not</p>",
        "<p>yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,</p>\n<p>no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose</p>\n<p>ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy may hug himself.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an</p>\n<p>uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would</p>\n<p>be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a</p>",
        "<p>laugh.”</p>\n<p>“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The</p>\n<p>wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may</p>\n<p>be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a</p>\n<p>joke.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am</p>\n<p>not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies</p>",
        "<p>and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I</p>\n<p>laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what</p>\n<p>you are without.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of</p>\n<p>my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong</p>\n<p>understanding to ridicule.”</p>\n<p>“Such as vanity and pride.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real</p>\n<p>superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.</p>\n<p>“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;</p>\n<p>“and pray what is the result?”</p>\n<p>“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it</p>\n<p>himself without disguise.”</p>",
        "<p>“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,</p>\n<p>but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch</p>\n<p>for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the</p>\n<p>convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of</p>\n<p>others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My</p>\n<p>feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper</p>\n<p>would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for</p>",
        "<p>ever.”</p>\n<p>“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment</p>\n<p>_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I</p>\n<p>really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”</p>\n<p>“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular</p>\n<p>evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”</p>\n<p>“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”</p>",
        "<p>“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a</p>\n<p>conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my</p>\n<p>waking Mr. Hurst.”</p>\n<p>Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was</p>\n<p>opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for</p>",
        "<p>it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>\n<p>In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the</p>\n<p>next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for</p>\n<p>them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on</p>\n<p>her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which</p>\n<p>would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive</p>\n<p>them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at</p>",
        "<p>least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage</p>\n<p>before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley</p>\n<p>and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very</p>\n<p>well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively</p>\n<p>resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the</p>\n<p>contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,</p>",
        "<p>she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at</p>\n<p>length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield</p>\n<p>that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.</p>\n<p>The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was</p>\n<p>said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on</p>\n<p>Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was</p>\n<p>then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike</p>",
        "<p>of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.</p>\n<p>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so</p>\n<p>soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be</p>\n<p>safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where</p>\n<p>she felt herself to be right.</p>\n<p>To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at</p>\n<p>Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss</p>",
        "<p>Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He</p>\n<p>wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration</p>\n<p>should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of</p>\n<p>influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been</p>\n<p>suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight</p>\n<p>in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke</p>\n<p>ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at</p>",
        "<p>one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most</p>\n<p>conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost</p>\n<p>all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last</p>\n<p>very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,</p>\n<p>after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to</p>\n<p>see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most</p>",
        "<p>tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of</p>\n<p>the whole party in the liveliest spirits.</p>\n<p>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet</p>\n<p>wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much</p>\n<p>trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their</p>\n<p>father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really</p>\n<p>glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The</p>",
        "<p>evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its</p>\n<p>animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human</p>\n<p>nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of</p>\n<p>threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information</p>\n<p>for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said</p>",
        "<p>in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers</p>\n<p>had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it</p>\n<p>had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>\n<p>“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at</p>\n<p>breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,</p>\n<p>because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”</p>\n<p>“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,</p>\n<p>unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners</p>\n<p>are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”</p>",
        "<p>“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.</p>\n<p>Bingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly</p>\n<p>thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.</p>\n<p>But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got</p>\n<p>to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this</p>\n<p>moment.”</p>",
        "<p>“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I</p>\n<p>never saw in the whole course of my life.”</p>\n<p>This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being</p>\n<p>eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.</p>\n<p>After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus</p>\n<p>explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a</p>\n<p>fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,</p>",
        "<p>and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,</p>\n<p>when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he</p>\n<p>pleases.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.</p>\n<p>Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing</p>\n<p>in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own</p>\n<p>children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago</p>",
        "<p>to do something or other about it.”</p>\n<p>Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.</p>\n<p>They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail</p>\n<p>bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of</p>\n<p>five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.</p>\n<p>“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and</p>",
        "<p>nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.</p>\n<p>But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little</p>\n<p>softened by his manner of expressing himself.”</p>\n<p>“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of</p>\n<p>him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false</p>\n<p>friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father</p>\n<p>did before him?”</p>",
        "<p>“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that</p>\n<p>head, as you will hear.”</p>\n<p>/* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */</p>\n<p>“Dear Sir,</p>\n<p>“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured</p>\n<p>father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the</p>\n<p>misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the</p>",
        "<p>breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,</p>\n<p>fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be</p>\n<p>on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be</p>\n<p>at variance.”--‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’--“My mind, however, is now</p>\n<p>made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,</p>\n<p>I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of</p>\n<p>the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis</p>",
        "<p>de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the</p>\n<p>valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest</p>\n<p>endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her</p>\n<p>Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies</p>\n<p>which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,</p>\n<p>moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing</p>\n<p>of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on</p>",
        "<p>these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of</p>\n<p>good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my</p>\n<p>being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly</p>\n<p>overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered</p>\n<p>olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the</p>\n<p>means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to</p>\n<p>apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make</p>",
        "<p>them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should</p>\n<p>have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself</p>\n<p>the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,</p>\n<p>November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your</p>\n<p>hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do</p>\n<p>without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting</p>\n<p>to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other</p>",
        "<p>clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir,</p>\n<p>with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your</p>\n<p>well-wisher and friend,</p>\n<p>“WILLIAM COLLINS.”</p>\n<p>“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”</p>\n<p>said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most</p>\n<p>conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will</p>",
        "<p>prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so</p>\n<p>indulgent as to let him come to us again.”</p>\n<p>“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if</p>\n<p>he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to</p>\n<p>discourage him.”</p>\n<p>“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean</p>\n<p>to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his</p>",
        "<p>credit.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying</p>\n<p>his parishioners whenever it were required.</p>\n<p>“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There</p>\n<p>is something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by</p>\n<p>apologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would</p>",
        "<p>help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”</p>\n<p>“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the</p>\n<p>reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his</p>\n<p>letter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”</p>\n<p>“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem</p>\n<p>defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I</p>\n<p>think it is well expressed.”</p>",
        "<p>To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any</p>\n<p>degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should</p>\n<p>come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had</p>\n<p>received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for</p>\n<p>their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,</p>\n<p>and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which</p>\n<p>astonished her husband and daughters.</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great</p>\n<p>politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the</p>\n<p>ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need</p>\n<p>of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,</p>\n<p>heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and</p>\n<p>stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated</p>\n<p>before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of</p>",
        "<p>daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this</p>\n<p>instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not</p>\n<p>doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This</p>\n<p>gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--</p>\n<p>“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may</p>\n<p>prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so</p>",
        "<p>oddly.”</p>\n<p>“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you</p>\n<p>must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,</p>\n<p>I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates</p>\n<p>will go when once they come to be entailed.”</p>\n<p>“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and</p>",
        "<p>could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing</p>\n<p>forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come</p>\n<p>prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,</p>\n<p>when we are better acquainted----”</p>\n<p>He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each</p>\n<p>other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The</p>\n<p>hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;</p>",
        "<p>and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s</p>\n<p>heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his</p>\n<p>own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;</p>\n<p>and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its</p>\n<p>cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured</p>\n<p>him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good</p>\n<p>cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged</p>",
        "<p>pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared</p>\n<p>herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a</p>\n<p>quarter of an hour.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>\n<p>During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants</p>\n<p>were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his</p>\n<p>guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to</p>\n<p>shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his</p>\n<p>comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen</p>",
        "<p>better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him</p>\n<p>to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect</p>\n<p>he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a</p>\n<p>person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself</p>\n<p>experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to</p>\n<p>approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of</p>\n<p>preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,</p>",
        "<p>and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of</p>\n<p>quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many</p>\n<p>people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.</p>\n<p>She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she</p>\n<p>made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the</p>\n<p>neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or</p>\n<p>two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to</p>",
        "<p>marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had</p>\n<p>once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly</p>\n<p>approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed</p>\n<p>to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.</p>\n<p>“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I</p>\n<p>dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies</p>\n<p>in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”</p>",
        "<p>“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane</p>\n<p>from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”</p>\n<p>“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”</p>\n<p>“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very</p>\n<p>extensive property.”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than</p>\n<p>many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”</p>",
        "<p>“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says</p>\n<p>that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the</p>\n<p>handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks</p>\n<p>the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly</p>\n<p>constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many</p>\n<p>accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am</p>\n<p>informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still</p>",
        "<p>resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends</p>\n<p>to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”</p>\n<p>“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at</p>\n<p>court.”</p>\n<p>“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;</p>\n<p>and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived</p>\n<p>the British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased</p>",
        "<p>with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to</p>\n<p>offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to</p>\n<p>ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her</p>\n<p>charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most</p>\n<p>elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by</p>\n<p>her. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and</p>\n<p>it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to</p>",
        "<p>pay.”</p>\n<p>“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you</p>\n<p>that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask</p>\n<p>whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the</p>\n<p>moment, or are the result of previous study?”</p>\n<p>“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I</p>\n<p>sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant</p>",
        "<p>compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to</p>\n<p>give them as unstudied an air as possible.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd</p>\n<p>as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,</p>\n<p>maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,</p>\n<p>and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner</p>\n<p>in his pleasure.</p>",
        "<p>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad</p>\n<p>to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,</p>\n<p>glad to invite him</p>\n<p>“Protested</p>\n<p>that he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book</p>",
        "<p>was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be</p>\n<p>from a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,</p>\n<p>protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia</p>\n<p>exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he</p>\n<p>chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and</p>\n<p>before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she</p>\n<p>interrupted him with,--</p>",
        "<p>“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away</p>\n<p>Richard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me</p>\n<p>so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more</p>\n<p>about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”</p>\n<p>Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--</p>\n<p>“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books</p>",
        "<p>of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes</p>\n<p>me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to</p>\n<p>them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”</p>\n<p>Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at</p>\n<p>backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted</p>\n<p>very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s</p>",
        "<p>interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would</p>\n<p>resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his</p>\n<p>young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any</p>\n<p>affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared</p>\n<p>for backgammon.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>\n<p>Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had</p>\n<p>been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of</p>\n<p>his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and</p>\n<p>miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he</p>\n<p>had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful</p>\n<p>acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had</p>",
        "<p>given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good</p>\n<p>deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in</p>\n<p>retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected</p>\n<p>prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de</p>\n<p>Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he</p>\n<p>felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,</p>\n<p>mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a</p>",
        "<p>clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of</p>\n<p>pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.</p>\n<p>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to</p>\n<p>marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had</p>\n<p>a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found</p>\n<p>them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.</p>\n<p>This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s</p>",
        "<p>estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and</p>\n<p>suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own</p>\n<p>part.</p>\n<p>His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face</p>\n<p>confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what</p>\n<p>was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled</p>\n<p>choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter</p>",
        "<p>of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a</p>\n<p>conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally</p>\n<p>to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at</p>\n<p>Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general</p>\n<p>encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to</p>\n<p>her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could</p>\n<p>not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her</p>",
        "<p>_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to</p>\n<p>hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon</p>\n<p>done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally</p>\n<p>next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have</p>\n<p>two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of</p>",
        "<p>the day before, was now high in her good graces.</p>\n<p>Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister</p>\n<p>except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,</p>\n<p>at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,</p>\n<p>and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed</p>\n<p>him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with</p>\n<p>one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such</p>\n<p>doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been</p>\n<p>always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the</p>\n<p>house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,</p>\n<p>was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their</p>\n<p>walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker</p>",
        "<p>than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and</p>\n<p>go.</p>\n<p>In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his</p>\n<p>cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of</p>\n<p>the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes</p>\n<p>were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and</p>\n<p>nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in</p>",
        "<p>a shop window, could recall them.</p>\n<p>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom</p>\n<p>they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking</p>\n<p>with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very</p>\n<p>Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and</p>\n<p>he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all</p>\n<p>wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible</p>",
        "<p>to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting</p>\n<p>something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the</p>\n<p>pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same</p>\n<p>spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to</p>\n<p>introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day</p>\n<p>before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in</p>\n<p>their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted</p>",
        "<p>only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was</p>\n<p>greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine</p>\n<p>countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction</p>\n<p>was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a</p>\n<p>readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the</p>\n<p>whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,</p>\n<p>when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were</p>",
        "<p>seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group</p>\n<p>the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual</p>\n<p>civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the</p>\n<p>principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on</p>\n<p>purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and</p>\n<p>was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they</p>\n<p>were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth</p>",
        "<p>happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,</p>\n<p>was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,</p>\n<p>one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,</p>\n<p>touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.</p>\n<p>What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was</p>\n<p>impossible not to long to know.</p>\n<p>In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what</p>",
        "<p>passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.</p>\n<p>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of</p>\n<p>Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s</p>\n<p>pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.</p>\n<p>Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the</p>\n<p>invitation.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from</p>",
        "<p>their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly</p>\n<p>expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own</p>\n<p>carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if</p>\n<p>she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had</p>\n<p>told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,</p>\n<p>because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed</p>\n<p>towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with</p>",
        "<p>her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,</p>\n<p>apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with</p>\n<p>her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be</p>\n<p>justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to</p>\n<p>her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good</p>\n<p>breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to</p>\n<p>by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she</p>",
        "<p>could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had</p>\n<p>brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s</p>\n<p>commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,</p>\n<p>she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham</p>\n<p>appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;</p>\n<p>but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the</p>\n<p>officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,</p>",
        "<p>disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the</p>\n<p>next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.</p>\n<p>Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn</p>\n<p>would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips</p>\n<p>protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery</p>\n<p>tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such</p>\n<p>delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,</p>\n<p>with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.</p>\n<p>As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass</p>\n<p>between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or</p>\n<p>both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such</p>\n<p>behaviour than her sister.</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Philips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for</p>\n<p>she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even</p>\n<p>pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although</p>\n<p>utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be</p>\n<p>attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so</p>\n<p>much attention in the whole course of his life.</p>"

        "<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>\n<p>As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their</p>\n<p>aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for</p>\n<p>a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach</p>\n<p>conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the</p>\n<p>girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,</p>\n<p>that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in</p>",
        "<p>the house.</p>\n<p>When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much</p>\n<p>struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he</p>\n<p>might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour</p>\n<p>at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much</p>\n<p>gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings</p>",
        "<p>was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the</p>\n<p>description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found</p>\n<p>that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all</p>\n<p>the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison</p>\n<p>with the housekeeper’s room.</p>\n<p>In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,</p>\n<p>with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the</p>",
        "<p>improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the</p>\n<p>gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive</p>\n<p>listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she</p>\n<p>heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as</p>\n<p>soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,</p>\n<p>and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine</p>\n<p>their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the</p>",
        "<p>interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.</p>\n<p>The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,</p>\n<p>Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking</p>\n<p>of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The</p>\n<p>officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,</p>\n<p>gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but</p>\n<p>Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and</p>",
        "<p>walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,</p>\n<p>breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.</p>\n<p>“The officers of the ----shire”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was</p>\n<p>turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated</p>\n<p>himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into</p>",
        "<p>conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the</p>\n<p>probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,</p>\n<p>dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the</p>\n<p>skill of the speaker.</p>\n<p>With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the</p>\n<p>officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young</p>\n<p>ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind</p>",
        "<p>listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly</p>\n<p>supplied with coffee and muffin.</p>\n<p>When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,</p>\n<p>in return, by sitting down to whist.</p>\n<p>“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to</p>\n<p>improve myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very</p>\n<p>thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he</p>\n<p>received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there</p>\n<p>seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most</p>\n<p>determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,</p>\n<p>she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets</p>\n<p>and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.</p>\n<p>Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore</p>",
        "<p>at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,</p>\n<p>though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,</p>\n<p>the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even</p>\n<p>mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly</p>\n<p>relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far</p>\n<p>Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in</p>\n<p>a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.</p>",
        "<p>“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject</p>\n<p>drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I</p>\n<p>understand.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten</p>\n<p>thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of</p>\n<p>giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been</p>\n<p>connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth could not but look surprised.</p>\n<p>“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after</p>\n<p>seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting</p>\n<p>yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”</p>\n<p>“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent</p>\n<p>four days in the same house with him, and I think him very</p>\n<p>disagreeable.”</p>",
        "<p>“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being</p>\n<p>agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him</p>\n<p>too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to</p>\n<p>be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general</p>\n<p>astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly</p>\n<p>anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”</p>\n<p>“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the</p>",
        "<p>neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in</p>\n<p>Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find</p>\n<p>him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”</p>\n<p>“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short</p>\n<p>interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond</p>\n<p>their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The</p>\n<p>world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his</p>",
        "<p>high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”</p>\n<p>“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an</p>\n<p>ill-tempered man.”</p>\n<p>Wickham only shook his head.</p>\n<p>“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is</p>\n<p>likely to be in this country much longer.”</p>\n<p>“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I</p>",
        "<p>was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will</p>\n<p>not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”</p>\n<p>“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_</p>\n<p>wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,</p>\n<p>and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for</p>\n<p>avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of</p>\n<p>very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.</p>",
        "<p>His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men</p>\n<p>that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be</p>\n<p>in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a</p>\n<p>thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been</p>\n<p>scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and</p>\n<p>everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the</p>\n<p>memory of his father.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with</p>\n<p>all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.</p>\n<p>Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the</p>\n<p>neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he</p>\n<p>had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but</p>\n<p>very intelligible gallantry.</p>\n<p>“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,</p>",
        "<p>“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a</p>\n<p>most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me</p>\n<p>further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great</p>\n<p>attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.</p>\n<p>Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and</p>\n<p>my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.</p>\n<p>A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have</p>",
        "<p>now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I</p>\n<p>was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in</p>\n<p>possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we</p>\n<p>were speaking of just now.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed!”</p>\n<p>“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best</p>\n<p>living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.</p>",
        "<p>I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,</p>\n<p>and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given</p>\n<p>elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his</p>\n<p>will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”</p>\n<p>“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to</p>\n<p>give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the</p>",
        "<p>intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely</p>\n<p>conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim</p>\n<p>to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.</p>\n<p>Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I</p>\n<p>was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no</p>\n<p>less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done</p>\n<p>anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I</p>",
        "<p>may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too</p>\n<p>freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very</p>\n<p>different sort of men, and that he hates me.”</p>\n<p>“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”</p>\n<p>“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I</p>\n<p>can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than</p>",
        "<p>ever as he expressed them.</p>\n<p>“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can</p>\n<p>have induced him to behave so cruelly?”</p>\n<p>“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but</p>\n<p>attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me</p>\n<p>less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon</p>\n<p>attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had</p>",
        "<p>not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort</p>\n<p>of preference which was often given me.”</p>\n<p>“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked</p>\n<p>him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be</p>\n<p>despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of</p>\n<p>descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as</p>\n<p>this!”</p>",
        "<p>After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_</p>\n<p>remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of</p>\n<p>his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition</p>\n<p>must be dreadful.”</p>\n<p>“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can</p>\n<p>hardly be just to him.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To</p>",
        "<p>treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his</p>\n<p>father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very</p>\n<p>countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself</p>\n<p>with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from</p>\n<p>childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest</p>\n<p>manner.”</p>\n<p>“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest</p>",
        "<p>part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,</p>\n<p>sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_</p>\n<p>father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,</p>\n<p>appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use</p>\n<p>to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the</p>\n<p>Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most</p>\n<p>intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to</p>",
        "<p>be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;</p>\n<p>and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a</p>\n<p>voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it</p>\n<p>to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”</p>\n<p>“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very</p>\n<p>pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better</p>\n<p>motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for</p>",
        "<p>dishonesty I must call it.”</p>\n<p>“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be</p>\n<p>traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has</p>\n<p>connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none</p>\n<p>of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger</p>\n<p>impulses even than pride.”</p>\n<p>“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money</p>\n<p>freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the</p>\n<p>poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his</p>\n<p>father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to</p>\n<p>degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the</p>\n<p>Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,</p>\n<p>which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and</p>",
        "<p>careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up</p>\n<p>as the most attentive and best of brothers.”</p>\n<p>“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”</p>\n<p>He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to</p>\n<p>speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very</p>\n<p>proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond</p>\n<p>of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is</p>",
        "<p>nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,</p>\n<p>and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her</p>\n<p>home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her</p>\n<p>education.”</p>\n<p>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not</p>\n<p>help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--</p>\n<p>“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,</p>",
        "<p>who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,</p>\n<p>be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you</p>\n<p>know Mr. Bingley?”</p>\n<p>“Not at all.”</p>\n<p>“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy is.”</p>\n<p>“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not</p>",
        "<p>want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth</p>\n<p>his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a</p>\n<p>very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride</p>\n<p>never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,</p>\n<p>sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing</p>\n<p>something for fortune and figure.”</p>\n<p>The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round</p>",
        "<p>the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin</p>\n<p>Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were</p>\n<p>made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;</p>\n<p>but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured</p>\n<p>her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;</p>\n<p>that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not</p>\n<p>make herself uneasy.</p>",
        "<p>“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a</p>\n<p>card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I</p>\n<p>am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There</p>\n<p>are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding</p>\n<p>little matters.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for</p>",
        "<p>a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations</p>\n<p>were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.</p>\n<p>“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a</p>\n<p>living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her</p>\n<p>notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”</p>\n<p>“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy</p>\n<p>were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”</p>",
        "<p>“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s</p>\n<p>connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before</p>\n<p>yesterday.”</p>\n<p>“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is</p>\n<p>believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”</p>\n<p>This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss</p>\n<p>Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her</p>",
        "<p>affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already</p>\n<p>self-destined to another.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her</p>\n<p>daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her</p>\n<p>Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of</p>\n<p>her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”</p>\n<p>“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have</p>",
        "<p>not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked</p>\n<p>her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the</p>\n<p>reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe</p>\n<p>she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from</p>\n<p>her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who</p>\n<p>chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of</p>\n<p>the first class.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and</p>\n<p>they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put</p>\n<p>an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.</p>\n<p>Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of</p>\n<p>Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to</p>\n<p>everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done</p>\n<p>gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could</p>",
        "<p>think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all</p>\n<p>the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as</p>\n<p>they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia</p>\n<p>talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the</p>\n<p>fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and</p>\n<p>Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses</p>\n<p>at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing</p>",
        "<p>that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage</p>\n<p>before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.</p>\n<p>“delighted to see their dear friend again”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.</p>\n<p>Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she</p>\n<p>knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.</p>\n<p>Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the</p>\n<p>veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The</p>\n<p>possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to</p>",
        "<p>interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be</p>\n<p>done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and</p>\n<p>throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be</p>\n<p>otherwise explained.</p>\n<p>“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or</p>\n<p>other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps</p>\n<p>misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to</p>",
        "<p>conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,</p>\n<p>without actual blame on either side.”</p>\n<p>“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in</p>\n<p>behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the</p>\n<p>business? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of</p>\n<p>somebody.”</p>\n<p>“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my</p>",
        "<p>opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light</p>\n<p>it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a</p>\n<p>manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is</p>\n<p>impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his</p>\n<p>character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so</p>\n<p>excessively deceived in him? Oh no.”</p>\n<p>“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last</p>\n<p>night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not</p>\n<p>so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”</p>\n<p>“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to</p>\n<p>think.”</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”</p>\n<p>But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when</p>\n<p>the affair became public.</p>\n<p>The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this</p>\n<p>conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom</p>\n<p>they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their</p>\n<p>personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was</p>\n<p>fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see</p>",
        "<p>their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and</p>\n<p>repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their</p>\n<p>separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;</p>\n<p>avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from</p>\n<p>their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and</p>\n<p>hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.</p>",
        "<p>The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every</p>\n<p>female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in</p>\n<p>compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by</p>\n<p>receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a</p>\n<p>ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the</p>\n<p>society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look</p>\n<p>and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended</p>\n<p>less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they</p>\n<p>each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,</p>\n<p>he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball</p>\n<p>was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she</p>\n<p>had no disinclination for it.</p>",
        "<p>“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I</p>\n<p>think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.</p>\n<p>Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who</p>\n<p>consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for</p>\n<p>everybody.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did</p>\n<p>not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking</p>",
        "<p>him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he</p>\n<p>did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s</p>\n<p>amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no</p>\n<p>scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,</p>\n<p>either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to</p>\n<p>dance.</p>\n<p>“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of</p>",
        "<p>this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can</p>\n<p>have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing</p>\n<p>myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair</p>\n<p>cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of</p>\n<p>soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a</p>\n<p>preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right</p>\n<p>cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being</p>\n<p>engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins</p>\n<p>instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help</p>\n<p>for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce</p>\n<p>delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as</p>\n<p>good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his</p>\n<p>gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first</p>",
        "<p>struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of</p>\n<p>being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a</p>\n<p>quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.</p>\n<p>The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing</p>\n<p>civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a</p>\n<p>compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than</p>\n<p>gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before</p>",
        "<p>her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage</p>\n<p>was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose</p>\n<p>to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the</p>\n<p>consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,</p>\n<p>till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.</p>\n<p>If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the</p>\n<p>younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;</p>",
        "<p>for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was</p>\n<p>such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No</p>\n<p>aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses</p>\n<p>for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some</p>\n<p>trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement</p>\n<p>of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on</p>\n<p>Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday</p>",
        "<p>endurable to Kitty and Lydia.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>\n<p>Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in</p>\n<p>vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a</p>\n<p>doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of</p>\n<p>meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that</p>\n<p>might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than</p>\n<p>usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all</p>",
        "<p>that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than</p>\n<p>might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the</p>\n<p>dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s</p>\n<p>pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this</p>\n<p>was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was</p>\n<p>pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and</p>\n<p>who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business</p>",
        "<p>the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant</p>\n<p>smile,--</p>\n<p>“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if</p>\n<p>he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”</p>\n<p>This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by</p>\n<p>Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for</p>\n<p>Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling</p>",
        "<p>of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate</p>\n<p>disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to</p>\n<p>the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.</p>\n<p>Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She</p>\n<p>was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away</p>\n<p>with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in</p>\n<p>speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.</p>",
        "<p>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect</p>\n<p>of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her</p>\n<p>spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she</p>\n<p>had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary</p>\n<p>transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her</p>\n<p>particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of</p>\n<p>distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and</p>",
        "<p>solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong</p>\n<p>without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a</p>\n<p>disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her</p>\n<p>release from him was ecstasy.</p>\n<p>She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of</p>\n<p>Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances</p>\n<p>were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with</p>",
        "<p>her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took</p>\n<p>her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without</p>\n<p>knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again</p>\n<p>immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of</p>\n<p>mind: Charlotte tried to console her.</p>\n<p>“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”</p>\n<p>“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find</p>",
        "<p>a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an</p>\n<p>evil.”</p>\n<p>When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her</p>\n<p>hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a</p>\n<p>simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant</p>\n<p>in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no</p>\n<p>answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which</p>",
        "<p>she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and</p>\n<p>reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.</p>\n<p>They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to</p>\n<p>imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at</p>\n<p>first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it</p>\n<p>would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,</p>\n<p>she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again</p>",
        "<p>silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,</p>\n<p>with--</p>\n<p>“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the</p>\n<p>dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the</p>\n<p>room, or the number of couples.”</p>\n<p>He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be</p>\n<p>said.</p>",
        "<p>“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I</p>\n<p>may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but</p>\n<p>_now_ we may be silent.”</p>\n<p>“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be</p>\n<p>entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of</p>\n<p>_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the</p>",
        "<p>trouble of saying as little as possible.”</p>\n<p>“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you</p>\n<p>imagine that you are gratifying mine?”</p>\n<p>“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great</p>\n<p>similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,</p>\n<p>taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say</p>\n<p>something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to</p>",
        "<p>posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”</p>\n<p>“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”</p>\n<p>said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_</p>\n<p>think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”</p>\n<p>“I must not decide on my own performance.”</p>\n<p>He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down</p>\n<p>the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often</p>",
        "<p>walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist</p>\n<p>the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just</p>\n<p>been forming a new acquaintance.”</p>\n<p>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his</p>\n<p>features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself</p>\n<p>for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a</p>\n<p>constrained manner said,--</p>",
        "<p>“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his</p>\n<p>_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,</p>\n<p>is less certain.”</p>\n<p>“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all</p>\n<p>his life.”</p>\n<p>Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At</p>",
        "<p>that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass</p>\n<p>through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on</p>\n<p>his dancing and his partner.</p>\n<p>“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very</p>\n<p>superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the</p>\n<p>first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not</p>",
        "<p>disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,</p>\n<p>especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing</p>\n<p>at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will</p>\n<p>then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.</p>\n<p>You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of</p>\n<p>that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”</p>\n<p>“Such very superior dancing is not</p>",
        "<p>often seen.”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir</p>\n<p>William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his</p>\n<p>eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and</p>\n<p>Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,</p>\n<p>he turned to his partner, and said,--</p>",
        "<p>“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking</p>\n<p>of.”</p>\n<p>“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have</p>\n<p>interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for</p>\n<p>themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,</p>\n<p>and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”</p>\n<p>“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.</p>",
        "<p>“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same</p>\n<p>feelings.”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be</p>\n<p>no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”</p>\n<p>“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of</p>\n<p>something else.”</p>\n<p>“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,</p>",
        "<p>with a look of doubt.</p>\n<p>“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her</p>\n<p>thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared</p>\n<p>by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,</p>\n<p>that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was</p>\n<p>unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being</p>\n<p>created_?”</p>",
        "<p>“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.</p>\n<p>“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”</p>\n<p>“I hope not.”</p>\n<p>“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,</p>\n<p>to be secure of judging properly at first.”</p>\n<p>“May I ask to what these questions tend?”</p>\n<p>“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring</p>",
        "<p>to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”</p>\n<p>“And what is your success?”</p>\n<p>She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different</p>\n<p>accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”</p>\n<p>“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary</p>\n<p>greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were</p>\n<p>not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to</p>",
        "<p>fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”</p>\n<p>“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another</p>\n<p>opportunity.”</p>\n<p>“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.</p>\n<p>She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in</p>\n<p>silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for</p>\n<p>in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,</p>",
        "<p>which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against</p>\n<p>another.</p>\n<p>They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,</p>\n<p>with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--</p>\n<p>“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?</p>\n<p>Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand</p>\n<p>questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his</p>",
        "<p>other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give</p>\n<p>implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using</p>\n<p>him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always</p>\n<p>remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a</p>\n<p>most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very</p>\n<p>well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear</p>",
        "<p>to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he</p>\n<p>could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he</p>\n<p>was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.</p>\n<p>His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and</p>\n<p>I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this</p>\n<p>discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his</p>\n<p>descent, one could not expect much better.”</p>",
        "<p>“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”</p>\n<p>said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing</p>\n<p>worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can</p>\n<p>assure you, he informed me himself.”</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.</p>\n<p>“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”</p>\n<p>“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if</p>",
        "<p>you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see</p>\n<p>nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make</p>\n<p>inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of</p>\n<p>such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently</p>\n<p>marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude</p>",
        "<p>for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave</p>\n<p>way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.</p>\n<p>“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her</p>\n<p>sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have</p>\n<p>been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case</p>\n<p>you may be sure of my pardon.”</p>\n<p>“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing</p>",
        "<p>satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his</p>\n<p>history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have</p>\n<p>principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,</p>\n<p>the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that</p>\n<p>Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has</p>\n<p>received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his</p>\n<p>sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am</p>",
        "<p>afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s</p>\n<p>regard.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”</p>\n<p>“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”</p>\n<p>“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am</p>\n<p>perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”</p>\n<p>“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard</p>",
        "<p>them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to</p>\n<p>him _conditionally_ only.”</p>\n<p>“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,</p>\n<p>“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.</p>\n<p>Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but</p>\n<p>since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt</p>\n<p>the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of</p>",
        "<p>both gentlemen as I did before.”</p>\n<p>She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on</p>\n<p>which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with</p>\n<p>delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of</p>\n<p>Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence</p>\n<p>in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew</p>\n<p>to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last</p>",
        "<p>partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,</p>\n<p>and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate</p>\n<p>as to make a most important discovery.</p>\n<p>“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now</p>\n<p>in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the</p>\n<p>gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of</p>\n<p>this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,</p>",
        "<p>Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would</p>\n<p>have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de</p>\n<p>Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made</p>\n<p>in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,</p>\n<p>and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total</p>\n<p>ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”</p>\n<p>“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”</p>",
        "<p>“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.</p>\n<p>I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to</p>\n<p>assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him</p>\n<p>that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as</p>\n<p>an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it</p>\n<p>was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either</p>",
        "<p>side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in</p>\n<p>consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with</p>\n<p>the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased</p>\n<p>speaking, replied thus,--</p>\n<p>“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your</p>\n<p>excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your</p>\n<p>understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference</p>",
        "<p>between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those</p>\n<p>which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider</p>\n<p>the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank</p>\n<p>in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the</p>\n<p>same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the</p>\n<p>dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform</p>\n<p>what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by</p>",
        "<p>your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,</p>\n<p>though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education</p>\n<p>and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like</p>\n<p>yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose</p>\n<p>reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at</p>\n<p>being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with</p>\n<p>a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if</p>",
        "<p>hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”</p>\n<p>“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him</p>\n<p>expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with</p>\n<p>unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,</p>\n<p>replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not</p>\n<p>discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed</p>\n<p>abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the</p>",
        "<p>end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins then returned to Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my</p>\n<p>reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered</p>\n<p>me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,</p>\n<p>that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be</p>\n<p>certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very</p>",
        "<p>handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”</p>\n<p>As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned</p>\n<p>her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the</p>\n<p>train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made</p>\n<p>her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that</p>\n<p>very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could</p>\n<p>bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring</p>",
        "<p>even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly</p>\n<p>saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,</p>\n<p>lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,</p>\n<p>she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within</p>\n<p>one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was</p>\n<p>talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing</p>\n<p>else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable</p>\n<p>of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such</p>\n<p>a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,</p>\n<p>were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a</p>\n<p>comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be</p>\n<p>certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It</p>\n<p>was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as</p>",
        "<p>Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;</p>\n<p>and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to</p>\n<p>consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might</p>\n<p>not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary</p>\n<p>to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such</p>\n<p>occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She</p>",
        "<p>concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally</p>\n<p>fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no</p>\n<p>chance of it.</p>\n<p>In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s</p>\n<p>words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible</p>\n<p>whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the</p>\n<p>chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her</p>",
        "<p>mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.</p>\n<p>“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am</p>\n<p>sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say</p>\n<p>nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”</p>\n<p>“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you</p>\n<p>to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by</p>\n<p>so doing.”</p>",
        "<p>Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would</p>\n<p>talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and</p>\n<p>blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently</p>\n<p>glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what</p>\n<p>she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was</p>\n<p>convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression</p>\n<p>of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and</p>",
        "<p>steady gravity.</p>\n<p>At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who</p>\n<p>had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no</p>\n<p>likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of</p>\n<p>tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she</p>\n<p>had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,</p>",
        "<p>preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent</p>\n<p>entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of</p>\n<p>complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an</p>\n<p>opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and</p>\n<p>she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience</p>\n<p>which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving</p>",
        "<p>amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be</p>\n<p>prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute</p>\n<p>began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;</p>\n<p>her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.</p>\n<p>She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly</p>\n<p>talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making</p>\n<p>signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,</p>",
        "<p>impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his</p>\n<p>interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,</p>\n<p>and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--</p>\n<p>“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.</p>\n<p>Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”</p>\n<p>Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid</p>",
        "<p>her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.</p>\n<p>“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I</p>\n<p>should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an</p>\n<p>air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly</p>\n<p>compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,</p>\n<p>to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to</p>\n<p>music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The</p>",
        "<p>rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such</p>\n<p>an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not</p>\n<p>offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time</p>\n<p>that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care</p>\n<p>and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making</p>\n<p>as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance</p>\n<p>that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards</p>",
        "<p>everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I</p>\n<p>cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who</p>\n<p>should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody</p>\n<p>connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded</p>\n<p>his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the</p>\n<p>room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.</p>\n<p>Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for</p>",
        "<p>having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady</p>\n<p>Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.</p>\n<p>To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to</p>\n<p>expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would</p>\n<p>have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or</p>\n<p>finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister</p>\n<p>that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his</p>",
        "<p>feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he</p>\n<p>must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should</p>\n<p>have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and</p>\n<p>she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or</p>\n<p>the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.</p>\n<p>The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he</p>",
        "<p>could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her</p>\n<p>power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with</p>\n<p>somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the</p>\n<p>room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent</p>\n<p>to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend</p>\n<p>himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining</p>\n<p>close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a</p>",
        "<p>project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who</p>\n<p>often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation</p>\n<p>to herself.</p>\n<p>She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:</p>\n<p>though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite</p>\n<p>disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the</p>\n<p>probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in</p>",
        "<p>it.</p>\n<p>The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a</p>\n<p>manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an</p>\n<p>hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how</p>\n<p>heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her</p>\n<p>sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and</p>\n<p>were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed</p>",
        "<p>every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a</p>\n<p>languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long</p>\n<p>speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his</p>\n<p>sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and</p>\n<p>politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said</p>\n<p>nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the</p>",
        "<p>rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a</p>\n<p>silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too</p>\n<p>much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,</p>\n<p>how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.</p>\n<p>When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly</p>\n<p>civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and</p>\n<p>addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy</p>",
        "<p>he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,</p>\n<p>without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful</p>\n<p>pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of</p>\n<p>waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to</p>\n<p>go the next day for a short time.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the</p>\n<p>delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of</p>",
        "<p>settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly</p>\n<p>see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four</p>\n<p>months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought</p>\n<p>with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the</p>\n<p>man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each</p>\n<p>was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.</p>",
        "<p>“to assure you in the most animated language”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>\n<p>The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his</p>\n<p>declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as</p>\n<p>his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having</p>\n<p>no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the</p>\n<p>moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the</p>\n<p>observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon</p>\n<p>after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--</p>\n<p>“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the</p>\n<p>course of this morning?”</p>\n<p>Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet instantly answered,--</p>",
        "<p>“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure</p>\n<p>she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And</p>\n<p>gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth</p>\n<p>called out,--</p>\n<p>“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse</p>\n<p>me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am</p>\n<p>going away myself.”</p>",
        "<p>“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And</p>\n<p>upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about</p>\n<p>to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s</p>\n<p>consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it</p>\n<p>over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried</p>",
        "<p>to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided</p>\n<p>between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as</p>\n<p>soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--</p>\n<p>“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from</p>\n<p>doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You</p>\n<p>would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little</p>\n<p>unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected</p>",
        "<p>mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport</p>\n<p>of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to</p>\n<p>dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as</p>\n<p>soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my</p>\n<p>future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this</p>\n<p>subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for</p>\n<p>marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design</p>",
        "<p>of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”</p>\n<p>The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away</p>\n<p>with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not</p>\n<p>use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and</p>\n<p>he continued,--</p>\n<p>“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for</p>\n<p>every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example</p>",
        "<p>of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add</p>\n<p>very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to</p>\n<p>have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and</p>\n<p>recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling</p>\n<p>patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked</p>\n<p>too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I</p>\n<p>left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was</p>",
        "<p>arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you</p>\n<p>must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a</p>\n<p>gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,</p>\n<p>useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small</p>\n<p>income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as</p>\n<p>you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the</p>\n<p>way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and</p>",
        "<p>kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the</p>\n<p>advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond</p>\n<p>anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be</p>\n<p>acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect</p>\n<p>which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general</p>\n<p>intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views</p>\n<p>were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I</p>",
        "<p>assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that</p>\n<p>being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured</p>\n<p>father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy</p>\n<p>myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that</p>\n<p>the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy</p>\n<p>event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be</p>\n<p>for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I</p>",
        "<p>flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing</p>\n<p>remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the</p>\n<p>violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and</p>\n<p>shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well</p>\n<p>aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds</p>\n<p>in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s</p>\n<p>decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,</p>",
        "<p>therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that</p>\n<p>no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”</p>\n<p>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.</p>\n<p>“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no</p>\n<p>answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for</p>\n<p>the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of</p>\n<p>your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline</p>",
        "<p>them.”</p>\n<p>“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the</p>\n<p>hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the</p>\n<p>man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their</p>\n<p>favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a</p>\n<p>third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have</p>\n<p>just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”</p>",
        "<p>“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an</p>\n<p>extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not</p>\n<p>one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so</p>\n<p>daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second</p>\n<p>time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_</p>\n<p>happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who</p>\n<p>would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I</p>",
        "<p>am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the</p>\n<p>situation.”</p>\n<p>“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,</p>\n<p>very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all</p>\n<p>disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of</p>\n<p>seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,</p>\n<p>economy, and other amiable qualifications.”</p>",
        "<p>“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must</p>\n<p>give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of</p>\n<p>believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by</p>\n<p>refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.</p>\n<p>In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your</p>\n<p>feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn</p>\n<p>estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be</p>",
        "<p>considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus</p>\n<p>spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus</p>\n<p>addressed her,--</p>\n<p>“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I</p>\n<p>shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given</p>\n<p>me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I</p>\n<p>know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the</p>",
        "<p>first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to</p>\n<p>encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the</p>\n<p>female character.”</p>\n<p>“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me</p>\n<p>exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form</p>\n<p>of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as</p>\n<p>may convince you of its being one.”</p>",
        "<p>“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your</p>\n<p>refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for</p>\n<p>believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand</p>\n<p>is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer</p>\n<p>would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my</p>\n<p>connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your</p>\n<p>own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into</p>",
        "<p>further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is</p>\n<p>by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.</p>\n<p>Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo</p>\n<p>the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,</p>\n<p>therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I</p>\n<p>shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by</p>\n<p>suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”</p>",
        "<p>“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind</p>\n<p>of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would</p>\n<p>rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you</p>\n<p>again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but</p>\n<p>to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect</p>\n<p>forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant</p>\n<p>female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the</p>",
        "<p>truth from her heart.”</p>\n<p>“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward</p>\n<p>gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express</p>\n<p>authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of</p>\n<p>being acceptable.”</p>\n<p>To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no</p>\n<p>reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he</p>",
        "<p>persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering</p>\n<p>encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered</p>\n<p>in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could</p>\n<p>not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>\n<p>Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his</p>\n<p>successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule</p>\n<p>to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the</p>\n<p>door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she</p>\n<p>entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in</p>\n<p>warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins</p>",
        "<p>received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then</p>\n<p>proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result</p>\n<p>of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the</p>\n<p>refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow</p>\n<p>from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.</p>\n<p>This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been</p>\n<p>glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage</p>",
        "<p>him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,</p>\n<p>and could not help saying so.</p>\n<p>“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be</p>\n<p>brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is</p>\n<p>a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but</p>\n<p>I will _make_ her know it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she</p>",
        "<p>is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would</p>\n<p>altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who</p>\n<p>naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she</p>\n<p>actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to</p>\n<p>force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of</p>\n<p>temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”</p>\n<p>“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is</p>",
        "<p>only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as</p>\n<p>good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and</p>\n<p>we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”</p>\n<p>She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her</p>\n<p>husband, called out, as she entered the library,--</p>\n<p>“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.</p>\n<p>You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will</p>",
        "<p>not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and</p>\n<p>not have _her_.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them</p>\n<p>on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by</p>\n<p>her communication.</p>\n<p>“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had</p>\n<p>finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”</p>",
        "<p>“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,</p>\n<p>and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”</p>\n<p>“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”</p>\n<p>“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her</p>\n<p>marrying him.”</p>\n<p>“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the</p>",
        "<p>library.</p>\n<p>“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for</p>\n<p>you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made</p>\n<p>you an offer of marriage. Is it true?”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth replied that it was.</p>\n<p>“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”</p>\n<p>“I have, sir.”</p>",
        "<p>“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your</p>\n<p>accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, or I will never see her again.”</p>\n<p>“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must</p>\n<p>be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you</p>\n<p>again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again</p>\n<p>if you _do_.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;</p>\n<p>but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the</p>\n<p>affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.</p>\n<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me</p>\n<p>to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”</p>\n<p>“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.</p>\n<p>First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the</p>",
        "<p>present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the</p>\n<p>library to myself as soon as may be.”</p>\n<p>Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;</p>\n<p>coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in</p>\n<p>her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined</p>\n<p>interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and</p>",
        "<p>sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner</p>\n<p>varied, however, her determination never did.</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.</p>\n<p>He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin</p>\n<p>could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other</p>\n<p>way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her</p>\n<p>deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.</p>",
        "<p>While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend</p>\n<p>the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to</p>\n<p>her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such</p>\n<p>fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has</p>\n<p>made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”</p>\n<p>“they entered the breakfast room”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<p>Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,</p>\n<p>who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the</p>\n<p>breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on</p>\n<p>the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating</p>\n<p>her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her</p>\n<p>family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;</p>\n<p>“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,</p>",
        "<p>nobody feels for my poor nerves.”</p>\n<p>Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as</p>\n<p>may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she</p>\n<p>can have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it</p>\n<p>into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,</p>\n<p>you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is</p>",
        "<p>to maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep</p>\n<p>you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told</p>\n<p>you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,</p>\n<p>and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking</p>\n<p>to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking</p>\n<p>to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have</p>\n<p>no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it</p>",
        "<p>is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”</p>\n<p>Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any</p>\n<p>attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.</p>\n<p>She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till</p>\n<p>they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately</p>\n<p>than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--</p>\n<p>“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and</p>",
        "<p>let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but</p>\n<p>Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,</p>\n<p>detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after</p>\n<p>herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little</p>\n<p>curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending</p>\n<p>not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected</p>",
        "<p>conversation:--</p>\n<p>“Oh, Mr. Collins!”</p>\n<p>“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.</p>\n<p>Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his</p>\n<p>displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to</p>\n<p>inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man</p>\n<p>who has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I</p>",
        "<p>trust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my</p>\n<p>positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I</p>\n<p>have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the</p>\n<p>blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.</p>\n<p>You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your</p>\n<p>family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your</p>\n<p>daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the</p>",
        "<p>compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.</p>\n<p>My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my</p>\n<p>dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all</p>\n<p>liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.</p>\n<p>My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due</p>\n<p>consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_</p>\n<p>has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>\n<p>The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily</p>\n<p>attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.</p>\n<p>As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not</p>\n<p>by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by</p>\n<p>stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to</p>",
        "<p>her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of</p>\n<p>himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose</p>\n<p>civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and</p>\n<p>especially to her friend.</p>\n<p>The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill</p>\n<p>health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth</p>\n<p>had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did</p>",
        "<p>not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on</p>\n<p>Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.</p>\n<p>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham</p>\n<p>were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.</p>\n<p>He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their</p>\n<p>aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were</p>\n<p>well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged</p>",
        "<p>that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.</p>\n<p>“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so</p>\n<p>many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes</p>\n<p>might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”</p>\n<p>She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full</p>\n<p>discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly</p>",
        "<p>bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with</p>\n<p>them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.</p>\n<p>His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the</p>\n<p>compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an</p>\n<p>occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came</p>",
        "<p>from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a</p>\n<p>sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s</p>\n<p>fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as</p>\n<p>she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.</p>\n<p>Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to</p>\n<p>join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but</p>\n<p>Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention</p>",
        "<p>even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,</p>\n<p>than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they</p>\n<p>had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is</p>\n<p>from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.</p>\n<p>The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way</p>\n<p>to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear</p>\n<p>what she says.”</p>",
        "<p>She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information</p>\n<p>of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,</p>\n<p>and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.</p>\n<p>Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to</p>\n<p>regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my</p>\n<p>dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many</p>\n<p>returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the</p>",
        "<p>meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most</p>\n<p>unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these</p>\n<p>high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of</p>\n<p>distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she</p>\n<p>saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their</p>\n<p>absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as</p>\n<p>to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon</p>",
        "<p>cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.</p>\n<p>“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be</p>\n<p>able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not</p>\n<p>hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks</p>\n<p>forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful</p>\n<p>intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater</p>\n<p>satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by</p>",
        "<p>them.”</p>\n<p>“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into</p>\n<p>Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.</p>\n<p>“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which</p>\n<p>took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we</p>\n<p>are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when</p>\n<p>Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have</p>",
        "<p>determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend</p>\n<p>his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are</p>\n<p>already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest</p>\n<p>friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I</p>\n<p>despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in</p>\n<p>the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux</p>\n<p>will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of</p>",
        "<p>whom we shall deprive you.’</p>\n<p>“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this</p>\n<p>winter.”</p>\n<p>“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”</p>\n<p>“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.</p>\n<p>But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which</p>\n<p>particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is</p>",
        "<p>impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely</p>\n<p>less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has</p>\n<p>her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection</p>\n<p>she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still</p>\n<p>more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being</p>\n<p>hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to</p>\n<p>you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country</p>",
        "<p>without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them</p>\n<p>unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have</p>\n<p>frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her</p>\n<p>relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s</p>\n<p>partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most</p>\n<p>capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to</p>\n<p>favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest</p>",
        "<p>Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness</p>\n<p>of so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said</p>\n<p>Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly</p>\n<p>declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;</p>\n<p>that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that</p>\n<p>if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most</p>\n<p>kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the</p>",
        "<p>subject?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”</p>\n<p>“Most willingly.”</p>\n<p>“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is</p>\n<p>in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to</p>\n<p>town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he</p>\n<p>does not care about you.”</p>",
        "<p>Jane shook her head.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you</p>\n<p>together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she</p>\n<p>is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the</p>\n<p>case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she</p>\n<p>is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion</p>",
        "<p>that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble</p>\n<p>in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I</p>\n<p>dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my</p>\n<p>dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley</p>\n<p>tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest</p>\n<p>degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on</p>\n<p>Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead</p>",
        "<p>of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”</p>\n<p>“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your</p>\n<p>representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the</p>\n<p>foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving</p>\n<p>anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived</p>\n<p>herself.”</p>\n<p>“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you</p>",
        "<p>will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.</p>\n<p>You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”</p>\n<p>“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in</p>\n<p>accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry</p>\n<p>elsewhere?”</p>\n<p>“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature</p>\n<p>deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is</p>",
        "<p>more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,</p>\n<p>by all means, to refuse him.”</p>\n<p>“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,</p>\n<p>though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could</p>\n<p>not hesitate.”</p>\n<p>“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider</p>\n<p>your situation with much compassion.”</p>",
        "<p>“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be</p>\n<p>required. A thousand things may arise in six months.”</p>\n<p>The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost</p>\n<p>contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s</p>\n<p>interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those</p>\n<p>wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man</p>\n<p>so totally independent of everyone.</p>",
        "<p>She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on</p>\n<p>the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.</p>\n<p>Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,</p>\n<p>though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that</p>\n<p>Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.</p>\n<p>They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the</p>\n<p>family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;</p>",
        "<p>but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,</p>\n<p>and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen</p>\n<p>to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After</p>\n<p>lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of</p>\n<p>thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at</p>\n<p>Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,</p>\n<p>that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take</p>",
        "<p>care to have two full courses.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>\n<p>The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the</p>\n<p>chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good</p>\n<p>humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”</p>\n<p>Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and</p>\n<p>that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was</p>",
        "<p>very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth</p>\n<p>had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her</p>\n<p>from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards</p>\n<p>herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so</p>\n<p>favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost</p>\n<p>sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.</p>\n<p>But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his</p>",
        "<p>character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next</p>\n<p>morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw</p>\n<p>himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,</p>\n<p>from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to</p>\n<p>conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known</p>\n<p>till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost</p>\n<p>secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,</p>",
        "<p>he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His</p>\n<p>reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas</p>\n<p>perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and</p>\n<p>instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had</p>\n<p>she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.</p>\n<p>In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,</p>\n<p>everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as</p>",
        "<p>they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that</p>\n<p>was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must</p>\n<p>be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with</p>\n<p>his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must</p>\n<p>guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its</p>\n<p>continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and</p>\n<p>disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that</p>",
        "<p>establishment were gained.</p>\n<p>Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;</p>\n<p>and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present</p>\n<p>circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom</p>\n<p>they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were</p>\n<p>exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more</p>\n<p>interest than the matter had ever</p>",
        "<p>“So much love and eloquence”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and</p>\n<p>Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins</p>\n<p>should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly</p>\n<p>expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.</p>\n<p>James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the</p>",
        "<p>occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two</p>\n<p>sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved</p>\n<p>from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte</p>\n<p>herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time</p>\n<p>to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was</p>\n<p>irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would</p>",
        "<p>be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,</p>\n<p>marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable</p>\n<p>provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however</p>\n<p>uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative</p>\n<p>from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of</p>\n<p>twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good</p>\n<p>luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the</p>",
        "<p>surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she</p>\n<p>valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and</p>\n<p>probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be</p>\n<p>shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved</p>\n<p>to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,</p>\n<p>when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had</p>\n<p>passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very</p>",
        "<p>dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the</p>\n<p>curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct</p>\n<p>questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was</p>\n<p>at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to</p>\n<p>publish his prosperous love.</p>\n<p>As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of</p>\n<p>the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies</p>",
        "<p>moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and</p>\n<p>cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,</p>\n<p>whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.</p>\n<p>“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly</p>\n<p>gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you</p>\n<p>may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as</p>\n<p>possible.”</p>",
        "<p>They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for</p>\n<p>so speedy a return, immediately said,--</p>\n<p>“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my</p>\n<p>good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of</p>\n<p>offending your patroness.”</p>\n<p>“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you</p>\n<p>for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so</p>",
        "<p>material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”</p>\n<p>“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her</p>\n<p>displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us</p>\n<p>again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,</p>\n<p>and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”</p>\n<p>“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such</p>\n<p>affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive</p>",
        "<p>from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of</p>\n<p>your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,</p>\n<p>though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall</p>\n<p>now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting</p>\n<p>my cousin Elizabeth.”</p>\n<p>With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally</p>\n<p>surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished</p>",
        "<p>to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of</p>\n<p>her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.</p>\n<p>She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a</p>\n<p>solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no</p>\n<p>means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and</p>\n<p>improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very</p>\n<p>agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this</p>",
        "<p>kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a</p>\n<p>private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.</p>\n<p>The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her</p>\n<p>friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but</p>\n<p>that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility</p>\n<p>as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was</p>\n<p>consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and</p>",
        "<p>she could not help crying out,--</p>\n<p>“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”</p>\n<p>The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her</p>\n<p>story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a</p>\n<p>reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained</p>\n<p>her composure, and calmly replied,--</p>\n<p>“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible</p>",
        "<p>that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,</p>\n<p>because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”</p>\n<p>But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort</p>\n<p>for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the</p>\n<p>prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she</p>\n<p>wished her all imaginable happiness.</p>\n<p>“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,</p>",
        "<p>very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.</p>\n<p>But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be</p>\n<p>satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never</p>\n<p>was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s</p>\n<p>character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my</p>\n<p>chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on</p>\n<p>entering the marriage state.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,</p>\n<p>they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much</p>\n<p>longer; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It</p>\n<p>was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so</p>\n<p>unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers</p>\n<p>of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now</p>\n<p>accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was</p>",
        "<p>not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible</p>\n<p>that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better</p>\n<p>feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a</p>\n<p>most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing</p>\n<p>herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction</p>\n<p>that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot</p>\n<p>she had chosen.</p>",
        "<p>“Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what</p>\n<p>she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,</p>\n<p>when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to</p>\n<p>announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,</p>\n<p>and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the</p>\n<p>houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,</p>",
        "<p>but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than</p>\n<p>politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always</p>\n<p>unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--</p>\n<p>“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know</p>\n<p>that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”</p>\n<p>Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne</p>\n<p>without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried</p>",
        "<p>him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the</p>\n<p>truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the</p>\n<p>most forbearing courtesy.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant</p>\n<p>a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by</p>\n<p>mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and</p>\n<p>endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,</p>",
        "<p>by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she</p>\n<p>was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the</p>\n<p>happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character</p>\n<p>of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while</p>\n<p>Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings</p>\n<p>found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving</p>",
        "<p>the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins</p>\n<p>had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy</p>\n<p>together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two</p>\n<p>inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that</p>\n<p>she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two</p>\n<p>points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could</p>",
        "<p>console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her</p>\n<p>resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without</p>\n<p>scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William</p>\n<p>or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she</p>\n<p>could at all forgive their daughter.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such</p>\n<p>as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for</p>",
        "<p>it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had</p>\n<p>been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and</p>\n<p>more foolish than his daughter!</p>\n<p>Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said</p>\n<p>less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;</p>\n<p>nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and</p>\n<p>Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a</p>",
        "<p>clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news</p>\n<p>to spread at Meryton.</p>\n<p>Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she</p>\n<p>called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,</p>\n<p>though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been</p>\n<p>enough to drive happiness away.</p>",
        "<p>Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them</p>\n<p>mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no</p>\n<p>real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her</p>\n<p>disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her</p>\n<p>sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could</p>\n<p>never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as</p>\n<p>Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.</p>",
        "<p>Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting</p>\n<p>the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised</p>\n<p>letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their</p>\n<p>father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a</p>\n<p>twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After</p>\n<p>discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,</p>\n<p>with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the</p>",
        "<p>affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained</p>\n<p>that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had</p>\n<p>been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at</p>\n<p>Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;</p>\n<p>for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that</p>\n<p>she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would</p>\n<p>be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early</p>",
        "<p>day for making him the happiest of men.</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of</p>\n<p>pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to</p>\n<p>complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come</p>\n<p>to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient</p>\n<p>and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house</p>\n<p>while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the</p>",
        "<p>most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they</p>\n<p>gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued</p>\n<p>absence.</p>\n<p>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after</p>\n<p>day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the</p>\n<p>report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to</p>\n<p>Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous</p>\n<p>falsehood.</p>\n<p>Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that</p>\n<p>his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she</p>\n<p>was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so</p>\n<p>dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its</p>\n<p>frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,</p>",
        "<p>and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss</p>\n<p>Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for</p>\n<p>the strength of his attachment.</p>\n<p>As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more</p>\n<p>painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of</p>\n<p>concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject</p>\n<p>was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an</p>",
        "<p>hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her</p>\n<p>impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he</p>\n<p>did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all</p>\n<p>Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable</p>\n<p>tranquillity.</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his</p>\n<p>reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his</p>",
        "<p>first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;</p>\n<p>and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them</p>\n<p>from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by</p>\n<p>him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time</p>\n<p>to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.</p>\n<p>“_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of</p>\n<p>anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and</p>\n<p>wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of</p>\n<p>Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she</p>\n<p>regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see</p>\n<p>them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and</p>\n<p>whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that</p>",
        "<p>they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself</p>\n<p>and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She</p>\n<p>complained bitterly of all this to her husband.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte</p>\n<p>Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced</p>\n<p>to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”</p>\n<p>“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for</p>",
        "<p>better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”</p>\n<p>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of</p>\n<p>making any answer, she went on as before.</p>\n<p>“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was</p>\n<p>not for the entail, I should not mind it.”</p>\n<p>“What should not you mind?”</p>\n<p>“I should not mind anything at all.”</p>",
        "<p>“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such</p>\n<p>insensibility.”</p>\n<p>“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How</p>\n<p>anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own</p>\n<p>daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!</p>\n<p>Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”</p>\n<p>“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>\n<p>Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first</p>\n<p>sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for</p>\n<p>the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had</p>\n<p>time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left</p>\n<p>the country.</p>\n<p>Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of</p>",
        "<p>the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the</p>\n<p>writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied</p>\n<p>the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline</p>\n<p>boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict</p>\n<p>the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former</p>\n<p>letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an</p>\n<p>inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of</p>",
        "<p>the latter with regard to new furniture.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,</p>\n<p>heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern</p>\n<p>for her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s</p>\n<p>assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no</p>\n<p>credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she</p>\n<p>had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she</p>",
        "<p>could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness</p>\n<p>of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave</p>\n<p>of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to</p>\n<p>the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been</p>\n<p>the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in</p>\n<p>whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as</p>\n<p>she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on</p>",
        "<p>which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She</p>\n<p>could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had</p>\n<p>really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;</p>\n<p>whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had</p>\n<p>escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of</p>\n<p>him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s</p>\n<p>situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.</p>",
        "<p>A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to</p>\n<p>Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a</p>\n<p>longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could</p>\n<p>not help saying,--</p>\n<p>“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no</p>\n<p>idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I</p>\n<p>will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall</p>",
        "<p>all be as we were before.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said</p>\n<p>nothing.</p>\n<p>“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no</p>\n<p>reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my</p>\n<p>acquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and</p>\n<p>nothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little</p>",
        "<p>time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”</p>\n<p>With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,</p>\n<p>that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it</p>\n<p>has done no harm to anyone but myself.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness</p>\n<p>and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to</p>\n<p>you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you</p>",
        "<p>deserve.”</p>\n<p>Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back</p>\n<p>the praise on her sister’s warm affection.</p>\n<p>“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the</p>\n<p>world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want</p>\n<p>to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be</p>\n<p>afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your</p>",
        "<p>privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people</p>\n<p>whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see</p>\n<p>of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms</p>\n<p>my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the</p>\n<p>little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit</p>\n<p>or sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,</p>\n<p>the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it</p>",
        "<p>is unaccountable!”</p>\n<p>“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will</p>\n<p>ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of</p>\n<p>situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and</p>\n<p>Charlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a</p>\n<p>large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be</p>\n<p>ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like</p>",
        "<p>regard and esteem for our cousin.”</p>\n<p>“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else</p>\n<p>could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that</p>\n<p>Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her</p>\n<p>understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a</p>\n<p>conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as</p>\n<p>I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him</p>",
        "<p>cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though</p>\n<p>it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,</p>\n<p>change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade</p>\n<p>yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of</p>\n<p>danger security for happiness.”</p>\n<p>“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied</p>\n<p>Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy</p>",
        "<p>together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You</p>\n<p>mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat</p>\n<p>you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and</p>\n<p>saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy</p>\n<p>ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man</p>\n<p>to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but</p>\n<p>our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than</p>",
        "<p>it does.”</p>\n<p>“And men take care that they should.”</p>\n<p>“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea</p>\n<p>of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”</p>\n<p>“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”</p>\n<p>said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others</p>\n<p>unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,</p>",
        "<p>want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,</p>\n<p>will do the business.”</p>\n<p>“And do you impute it to either of those?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I</p>\n<p>think of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”</p>\n<p>“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”</p>",
        "<p>“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can</p>\n<p>only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can</p>\n<p>secure it.”</p>\n<p>“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his</p>\n<p>happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they</p>\n<p>may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great</p>\n<p>connections, and pride.”</p>",
        "<p>“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;</p>\n<p>“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have</p>\n<p>known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love</p>\n<p>her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely</p>\n<p>they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think</p>\n<p>herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very</p>\n<p>objectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to</p>",
        "<p>part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an</p>\n<p>affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most</p>\n<p>unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been</p>\n<p>mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of</p>\n<p>what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it</p>\n<p>in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s</p>",
        "<p>name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no</p>\n<p>more; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account</p>\n<p>for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it</p>\n<p>with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what</p>\n<p>she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely</p>\n<p>the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw</p>",
        "<p>her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at</p>\n<p>the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best</p>\n<p>comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one</p>\n<p>day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next</p>\n<p>to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and</p>\n<p>then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction</p>",
        "<p>among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to</p>\n<p>be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at</p>\n<p>Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham</p>\n<p>be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not</p>\n<p>all expect Jane’s good fortune.”</p>\n<p>“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of</p>",
        "<p>that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will</p>\n<p>always make the most of it.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom</p>\n<p>which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn</p>\n<p>family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now</p>\n<p>added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already</p>\n<p>heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,</p>",
        "<p>was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was</p>\n<p>pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they</p>\n<p>had known anything of the matter.</p>\n<p>Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any</p>\n<p>extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of</p>\n<p>Hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for</p>\n<p>allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>\n<p>After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of</p>\n<p>Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his</p>\n<p>side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to</p>\n<p>hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day</p>\n<p>would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave</p>",
        "<p>of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished</p>\n<p>his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father</p>\n<p>another letter of thanks.</p>\n<p>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her</p>\n<p>brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at</p>\n<p>Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly</p>\n<p>superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield</p>",
        "<p>ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by</p>\n<p>trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so</p>\n<p>well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger</p>\n<p>than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant</p>\n<p>woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two</p>\n<p>eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.</p>\n<p>They had frequently been staying with her in town.</p>",
        "<p>The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to</p>\n<p>distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was</p>\n<p>done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They</p>\n<p>had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her</p>\n<p>girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing</p>\n<p>in it.</p>",
        "<p>“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.</p>\n<p>Bingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think</p>\n<p>that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it</p>\n<p>been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,</p>\n<p>and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have</p>\n<p>a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as</p>\n<p>much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,</p>",
        "<p>sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of</p>\n<p>them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted</p>\n<p>so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves</p>\n<p>before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the</p>\n<p>greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of</p>\n<p>long sleeves.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in</p>",
        "<p>the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her</p>\n<p>sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the</p>\n<p>conversation.</p>\n<p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.</p>\n<p>“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I</p>\n<p>am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,</p>\n<p>such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty</p>",
        "<p>girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily</p>\n<p>forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”</p>\n<p>“Offended two or three young ladies”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not</p>\n<p>do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen</p>\n<p>that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of</p>",
        "<p>independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in</p>\n<p>love with only a few days before.”</p>\n<p>“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so</p>\n<p>doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as</p>\n<p>often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s</p>\n<p>acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley’s love?”</p>",
        "<p>“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite</p>\n<p>inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time</p>\n<p>they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he</p>\n<p>offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I</p>\n<p>spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be</p>\n<p>finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor</p>",
        "<p>Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get</p>\n<p>over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you</p>\n<p>would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would</p>\n<p>be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of</p>\n<p>service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as</p>\n<p>anything.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded</p>",
        "<p>of her sister’s ready acquiescence.</p>\n<p>“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to</p>\n<p>this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of</p>\n<p>town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go</p>\n<p>out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,</p>\n<p>unless he really comes to see her.”</p>\n<p>“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his</p>",
        "<p>friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a</p>\n<p>part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,</p>\n<p>perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he</p>\n<p>would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its</p>\n<p>impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley</p>\n<p>never stirs without him.”</p>\n<p>“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane</p>",
        "<p>correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”</p>\n<p>“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”</p>\n<p>But, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this</p>\n<p>point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being</p>\n<p>withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which</p>\n<p>convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely</p>\n<p>hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that</p>",
        "<p>his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends</p>\n<p>successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s</p>\n<p>attractions.</p>\n<p>Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the</p>\n<p>Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she</p>\n<p>hoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she</p>\n<p>might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of</p>",
        "<p>seeing him.</p>\n<p>The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,</p>\n<p>the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its</p>\n<p>engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment</p>\n<p>of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family</p>\n<p>dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always</p>\n<p>made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and</p>",
        "<p>on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s</p>\n<p>warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing</p>\n<p>them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference</p>\n<p>of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she</p>\n<p>resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left</p>\n<p>Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such</p>\n<p>an attachment.</p>",
        "<p>To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,</p>\n<p>unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,</p>\n<p>before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part</p>\n<p>of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many</p>\n<p>acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since</p>\n<p>the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power</p>\n<p>to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been</p>",
        "<p>in the way of procuring.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by</p>\n<p>character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible</p>\n<p>subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with</p>\n<p>the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her</p>\n<p>tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was</p>\n<p>delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the</p>",
        "<p>present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of</p>\n<p>that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might</p>\n<p>agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having</p>\n<p>heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,</p>\n<p>ill-natured boy.</p>\n<p>“Will you come and see me?”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on</p>\n<p>the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after</p>\n<p>honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--</p>\n<p>“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you</p>\n<p>are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking</p>\n<p>openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve</p>",
        "<p>yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of</p>\n<p>fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against</p>\n<p>_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he</p>\n<p>ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you</p>\n<p>must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all</p>\n<p>expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and</p>\n<p>good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”</p>",
        "<p>“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of</p>\n<p>myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I</p>\n<p>can prevent it.”</p>\n<p>“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,</p>\n<p>the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to</p>\n<p>me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence</p>\n<p>of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does</p>\n<p>me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My</p>\n<p>father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I</p>\n<p>should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but</p>",
        "<p>since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are</p>\n<p>seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into</p>\n<p>engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many</p>\n<p>of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that</p>\n<p>it would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is</p>\n<p>not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his</p>\n<p>first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In</p>",
        "<p>short, I will do my best.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very</p>\n<p>often. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”</p>\n<p>“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very</p>\n<p>true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine</p>\n<p>that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been</p>\n<p>so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the</p>",
        "<p>necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my</p>\n<p>honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you</p>\n<p>are satisfied.”</p>\n<p>Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for</p>\n<p>the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice</p>\n<p>being given on such a point without being resented.</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted</p>",
        "<p>by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the</p>\n<p>Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His</p>\n<p>marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned</p>\n<p>as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured</p>\n<p>tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the</p>\n<p>wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and</p>\n<p>when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s</p>",
        "<p>ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,</p>\n<p>accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,</p>\n<p>Charlotte said,--</p>\n<p>“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”</p>\n<p>“_That_ you certainly shall.”</p>\n<p>“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”</p>\n<p>“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to</p>\n<p>come to Hunsford.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the</p>\n<p>visit.</p>\n<p>“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and</p>\n<p>I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be</p>\n<p>as welcome to me as either of them.”</p>",
        "<p>The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from</p>\n<p>the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the</p>\n<p>subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their</p>\n<p>correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it</p>\n<p>should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never</p>\n<p>address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;</p>\n<p>and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the</p>",
        "<p>sake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters</p>\n<p>were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be</p>\n<p>curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would</p>\n<p>like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to</p>\n<p>be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte</p>\n<p>expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She</p>\n<p>wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing</p>",
        "<p>which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and</p>\n<p>roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most</p>\n<p>friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and</p>\n<p>Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait</p>\n<p>for her own visit there, to know the rest.</p>\n<p>Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their</p>\n<p>safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it</p>",
        "<p>would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.</p>\n<p>Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience</p>\n<p>generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or</p>\n<p>hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that</p>\n<p>her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been</p>\n<p>lost.</p>\n<p>“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the</p>",
        "<p>town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”</p>\n<p>She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.</p>\n<p>“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very</p>\n<p>glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming</p>\n<p>to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.</p>\n<p>I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much</p>\n<p>engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that</p>",
        "<p>Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was</p>\n<p>not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall</p>\n<p>soon see them here.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that</p>\n<p>accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.</p>\n<p>Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to</p>\n<p>persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be</p>",
        "<p>blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning</p>\n<p>for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the</p>\n<p>visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet</p>\n<p>more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself</p>\n<p>no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister</p>\n<p>will prove what she felt:--</p>\n<p>“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in</p>",
        "<p>her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have</p>\n<p>been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my</p>\n<p>dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me</p>\n<p>obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour</p>\n<p>was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at</p>\n<p>all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,</p>\n<p>if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should</p>",
        "<p>be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;</p>\n<p>and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she</p>\n<p>did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she</p>\n<p>made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a</p>\n<p>word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so</p>\n<p>altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly</p>\n<p>resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I</p>",
        "<p>cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as</p>\n<p>she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on</p>\n<p>her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been</p>\n<p>acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her</p>\n<p>brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and</p>\n<p>though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she</p>\n<p>feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so</p>",
        "<p>deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may</p>\n<p>feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,</p>\n<p>however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all</p>\n<p>cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my</p>\n<p>being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and</p>\n<p>yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to</p>\n<p>persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot</p>",
        "<p>understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be</p>\n<p>almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of</p>\n<p>duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful</p>\n<p>thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,</p>\n<p>and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear</p>\n<p>from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never</p>\n<p>returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not</p>",
        "<p>with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely</p>\n<p>glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at</p>\n<p>Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am</p>\n<p>sure you will be very comfortable there.</p>\n<p>“Yours, etc.”</p>\n<p>This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she</p>\n<p>considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.</p>",
        "<p>All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not</p>\n<p>even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every</p>\n<p>review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible</p>\n<p>advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly</p>\n<p>regret what he had thrown away.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise</p>",
        "<p>concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had</p>\n<p>such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to</p>\n<p>herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,</p>\n<p>he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to</p>\n<p>see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.</p>\n<p>Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied</p>\n<p>with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune</p>",
        "<p>permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most</p>\n<p>remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself</p>\n<p>agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than</p>\n<p>in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.</p>\n<p>Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to</p>\n<p>suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was</p>\n<p>ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very</p>",
        "<p>sincerely wish him happy.</p>\n<p>All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the</p>\n<p>circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,</p>\n<p>that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that</p>\n<p>pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,</p>\n<p>and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial</p>\n<p>towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find</p>",
        "<p>out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think</p>\n<p>her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My</p>\n<p>watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more</p>\n<p>interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love</p>\n<p>with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.</p>\n<p>Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take</p>\n<p>his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways</p>",
        "<p>of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that</p>\n<p>handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the</p>\n<p>plain.”</p>\n<p>“On the Stairs”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>\n<p>With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise</p>\n<p>diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and</p>\n<p>sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take</p>\n<p>Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of</p>\n<p>going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the</p>\n<p>plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater</p>",
        "<p>pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire</p>\n<p>of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.</p>\n<p>There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such</p>\n<p>uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change</p>\n<p>was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give</p>\n<p>her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have</p>\n<p>been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,</p>",
        "<p>and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was</p>\n<p>to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of</p>\n<p>spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as</p>\n<p>perfect as plan could be.</p>\n<p>The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,</p>\n<p>and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he</p>\n<p>told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.</p>",
        "<p>The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on</p>\n<p>his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that</p>\n<p>Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the</p>\n<p>first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner</p>\n<p>of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what</p>\n<p>she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their</p>\n<p>opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there</p>",
        "<p>was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to</p>\n<p>him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,</p>\n<p>whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable</p>\n<p>and pleasing.</p>\n<p>Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think</p>\n<p>him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a</p>\n<p>good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say</p>",
        "<p>that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much</p>\n<p>delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but</p>\n<p>she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of</p>\n<p>the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were</p>\n<p>worn out, like his information.</p>\n<p>It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early</p>\n<p>as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s</p>",
        "<p>door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when</p>\n<p>they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and</p>\n<p>lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,</p>\n<p>whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to</p>\n<p>wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her</p>\n<p>for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and</p>",
        "<p>kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and</p>\n<p>shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her</p>\n<p>sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to</p>\n<p>her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her</p>\n<p>spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to</p>\n<p>hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the</p>",
        "<p>particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and</p>\n<p>repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and</p>\n<p>herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the</p>\n<p>acquaintance.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and</p>\n<p>complimented her on bearing it so well.</p>\n<p>“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I</p>",
        "<p>should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”</p>\n<p>“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,</p>\n<p>between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,</p>\n<p>and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,</p>\n<p>because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a</p>\n<p>girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is</p>\n<p>mercenary.”</p>",
        "<p>“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know</p>\n<p>what to think.”</p>\n<p>“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”</p>\n<p>“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death</p>\n<p>made her mistress of this fortune?”</p>\n<p>“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_</p>\n<p>affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for</p>",
        "<p>making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally</p>\n<p>poor?”</p>\n<p>“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so</p>\n<p>soon after this event.”</p>\n<p>“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant</p>\n<p>decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,</p>\n<p>why should _we_?”</p>",
        "<p>“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being</p>\n<p>deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be</p>\n<p>mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”</p>\n<p>“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,</p>\n<p>to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in</p>",
        "<p>Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not</p>\n<p>much better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow</p>\n<p>where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has</p>\n<p>neither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones</p>\n<p>worth knowing, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”</p>\n<p>Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the</p>",
        "<p>unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in</p>\n<p>a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.</p>\n<p>“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.</p>\n<p>Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”</p>\n<p>No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her</p>\n<p>acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear</p>\n<p>aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me</p>",
        "<p>fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men</p>\n<p>to rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And</p>\n<p>when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without</p>\n<p>being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where</p>\n<p>we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,</p>\n<p>and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when</p>\n<p>we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling</p>",
        "<p>about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less</p>\n<p>insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”</p>\n<p>“At the door”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>\n<p>Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to</p>\n<p>Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had</p>\n<p>seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,</p>\n<p>and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.</p>\n<p>When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in</p>\n<p>search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.</p>",
        "<p>The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth</p>\n<p>smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.</p>\n<p>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the</p>\n<p>road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,</p>\n<p>everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte</p>\n<p>appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which</p>\n<p>led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of</p>",
        "<p>the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing</p>\n<p>at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the</p>\n<p>liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with</p>\n<p>coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw</p>\n<p>instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:</p>\n<p>his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some</p>\n<p>minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her</p>",
        "<p>family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the</p>\n<p>neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were</p>\n<p>in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious</p>\n<p>formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s</p>\n<p>offers of refreshment.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help</p>\n<p>fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,</p>",
        "<p>and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if</p>\n<p>wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though</p>\n<p>everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him</p>\n<p>by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,</p>\n<p>that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,</p>\n<p>which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on</p>",
        "<p>Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general</p>\n<p>Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire</p>\n<p>every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the</p>\n<p>fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had</p>\n<p>happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the</p>\n<p>garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of</p>\n<p>which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most</p>",
        "<p>respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance</p>\n<p>with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and</p>\n<p>owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way</p>\n<p>through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an</p>\n<p>interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out</p>\n<p>with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the</p>\n<p>fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in</p>",
        "<p>the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which</p>\n<p>the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with</p>\n<p>the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that</p>\n<p>bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a</p>\n<p>handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.</p>\n<p>From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;</p>\n<p>but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white</p>",
        "<p>frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte</p>\n<p>took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,</p>\n<p>probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s</p>\n<p>help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything</p>\n<p>was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which</p>\n<p>Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be</p>\n<p>forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by</p>",
        "<p>Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often</p>\n<p>forgotten.</p>\n<p>She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It</p>\n<p>was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining</p>\n<p>in, observed,--</p>\n<p>“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine</p>\n<p>de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will</p>",
        "<p>be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I</p>\n<p>doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when</p>\n<p>service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will</p>\n<p>include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she</p>\n<p>honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is</p>\n<p>charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to</p>\n<p>walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I</p>",
        "<p>_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added</p>\n<p>Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”</p>\n<p>“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of</p>\n<p>woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”</p>\n<p>The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and</p>\n<p>telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon</p>\n<p>Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,</p>\n<p>and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it</p>\n<p>was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would</p>\n<p>pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious</p>\n<p>interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse</p>\n<p>with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.</p>",
        "<p>About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready</p>\n<p>for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in</p>\n<p>confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running</p>\n<p>upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened</p>\n<p>the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with</p>\n<p>agitation, cried out,--</p>\n<p>“In Conversation with the ladies”</p>",
        "<p>[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]</p>\n<p>“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for</p>\n<p>there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make</p>\n<p>haste, and come down this moment.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;</p>\n<p>and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest</p>\n<p>of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the</p>",
        "<p>garden gate.</p>\n<p>“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs</p>\n<p>were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her</p>\n<p>daughter!”</p>\n<p>“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The</p>\n<p>other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little</p>",
        "<p>creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”</p>\n<p>“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.</p>\n<p>Why does she not come in?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours</p>\n<p>when Miss De Bourgh comes in.”</p>\n<p>“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She</p>\n<p>looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will</p>",
        "<p>make him a very proper wife.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation</p>\n<p>with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was</p>\n<p>stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness</p>\n<p>before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that</p>\n<p>way.</p>\n<p>At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and</p>",
        "<p>the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two</p>\n<p>girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which</p>\n<p>Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked</p>\n<p>to dine at Rosings the next day.</p>\n<p>‘Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.’</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>\n<p>Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.</p>\n<p>The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering</p>\n<p>visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his</p>\n<p>wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of</p>\n<p>doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.</p>",
        "<p>“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by</p>\n<p>her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening</p>\n<p>at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that</p>\n<p>it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?</p>\n<p>Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine</p>\n<p>there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so</p>\n<p>immediately after your arrival?”</p>",
        "<p>“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,</p>\n<p>“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which</p>\n<p>my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such</p>\n<p>instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”</p>\n<p>Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their</p>\n<p>visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what</p>\n<p>they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and</p>",
        "<p>so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.</p>\n<p>When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to</p>\n<p>Elizabeth,--</p>\n<p>“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which</p>\n<p>becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on</p>\n<p>whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion</p>",
        "<p>for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for</p>\n<p>being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank</p>\n<p>preserved.”</p>\n<p>While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different</p>\n<p>doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much</p>\n<p>objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of</p>\n<p>her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,</p>",
        "<p>who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her</p>\n<p>introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done</p>\n<p>to his presentation at St. James’s.</p>\n<p>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile</p>\n<p>across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such</p>\n<p>raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but</p>",
        "<p>slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the</p>\n<p>house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally</p>\n<p>cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</p>\n<p>When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment</p>\n<p>increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or</p>",
        "<p>miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she</p>\n<p>thought she could witness without trepidation.</p>\n<p>From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a</p>\n<p>rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed</p>\n<p>the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,</p>\n<p>her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great</p>\n<p>condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it</p>",
        "<p>with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was</p>\n<p>performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks</p>\n<p>which he would have thought necessary.</p>\n<p>In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely</p>\n<p>awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage</p>\n<p>enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;</p>\n<p>and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge</p>",
        "<p>of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself</p>\n<p>quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her</p>\n<p>composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked</p>\n<p>features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not</p>\n<p>conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her</p>\n<p>visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by</p>\n<p>silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as</p>",
        "<p>marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she</p>\n<p>believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.</p>\n<p>When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment</p>\n<p>she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the</p>\n<p>daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her</p>\n<p>being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any</p>",
        "<p>likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her</p>\n<p>features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very</p>\n<p>little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance</p>\n<p>there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening</p>\n<p>to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before</p>\n<p>her eyes.</p>\n<p>After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to</p>",
        "<p>admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,</p>\n<p>and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth</p>\n<p>looking at in the summer.</p>\n<p>The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,</p>\n<p>and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he</p>\n<p>had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by</p>\n<p>her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish</p>",
        "<p>nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;</p>\n<p>and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who</p>\n<p>was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a</p>\n<p>manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most</p>\n<p>gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty</p>\n<p>to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready</p>",
        "<p>to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between</p>\n<p>Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in</p>\n<p>listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all</p>\n<p>the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how</p>\n<p>little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and</p>\n<p>fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,</p>\n<p>and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.</p>",
        "<p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be</p>\n<p>done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any</p>\n<p>intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every</p>\n<p>subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have</p>\n<p>her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic</p>\n<p>concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as</p>\n<p>to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be</p>",
        "<p>regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the</p>\n<p>care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was</p>\n<p>beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an</p>\n<p>occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with</p>\n<p>Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew</p>\n<p>the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,</p>",
        "<p>pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters</p>\n<p>she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of</p>\n<p>them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they</p>\n<p>had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her</p>\n<p>mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her</p>\n<p>questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then</p>\n<p>observed,--</p>",
        "<p>“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your</p>\n<p>sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no</p>\n<p>occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought</p>\n<p>necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss</p>\n<p>Bennet?”</p>\n<p>“A little.”</p>\n<p>“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our</p>",
        "<p>instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it</p>\n<p>some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”</p>\n<p>“One of them does.”</p>\n<p>“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss</p>\n<p>Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do</p>\n<p>you draw?”</p>\n<p>“No, not at all.”</p>",
        "<p>“What, none of you?”</p>\n<p>“Not one.”</p>\n<p>“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother</p>\n<p>should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”</p>\n<p>“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”</p>\n<p>“Has your governess left you?”</p>\n<p>“We never had any governess.”</p>",
        "<p>“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home</p>\n<p>without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must</p>\n<p>have been quite a slave to your education.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not</p>\n<p>been the case.</p>\n<p>“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must</p>\n<p>have been neglected.”</p>",
        "<p>“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as</p>\n<p>wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to</p>\n<p>read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be</p>\n<p>idle certainly might.”</p>\n<p>“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had</p>\n<p>known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage</p>\n<p>one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady</p>",
        "<p>and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is</p>\n<p>wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that</p>\n<p>way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces</p>\n<p>of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and</p>\n<p>it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who</p>\n<p>was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite</p>\n<p>delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s</p>",
        "<p>calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your</p>\n<p>younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, ma’am, all.”</p>\n<p>“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The</p>\n<p>younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must</p>\n<p>be very young?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much</p>\n<p>in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon</p>\n<p>younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and</p>\n<p>amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to</p>\n<p>marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth</p>\n<p>as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would</p>\n<p>not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”</p>",
        "<p>“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly</p>\n<p>for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”</p>\n<p>“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your</p>\n<p>Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;</p>\n<p>and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever</p>\n<p>dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.</p>",
        "<p>“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not</p>\n<p>conceal your age.”</p>\n<p>“I am not one-and-twenty.”</p>\n<p>When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables</p>\n<p>were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat</p>\n<p>down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the</p>\n<p>two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her</p>",
        "<p>party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was</p>\n<p>uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson</p>\n<p>expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or</p>\n<p>having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the</p>\n<p>other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes</p>\n<p>of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins</p>\n<p>was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her</p>",
        "<p>for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.</p>\n<p>Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes</p>\n<p>and noble names.</p>\n<p>When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,</p>\n<p>the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,</p>\n<p>gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered</p>\n<p>round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were</p>",
        "<p>to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the</p>\n<p>arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As</p>\n<p>soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her</p>\n<p>cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,</p>\n<p>for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But</p>\n<p>her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means</p>",
        "<p>satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s</p>\n<p>praise into his own hands.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>\n<p>Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long</p>\n<p>enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,</p>\n<p>and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not</p>\n<p>often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his</p>\n<p>mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but</p>\n<p>when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,</p>",
        "<p>and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her</p>\n<p>cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast</p>\n<p>and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in</p>\n<p>reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,</p>\n<p>which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer</p>\n<p>the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a</p>",
        "<p>pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent</p>\n<p>reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been</p>\n<p>much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and</p>\n<p>she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.</p>\n<p>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and</p>\n<p>were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went</p>\n<p>along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,</p>",
        "<p>which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened</p>\n<p>almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had</p>\n<p>a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever</p>\n<p>prevailed on to get out.</p>\n<p>Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and</p>\n<p>not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;</p>\n<p>and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings</p>",
        "<p>to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many</p>\n<p>hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,</p>\n<p>and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during</p>\n<p>these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,</p>\n<p>and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement</p>\n<p>of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she</p>\n<p>accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding</p>",
        "<p>out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the</p>\n<p>commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate</p>\n<p>in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be</p>\n<p>quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the</p>\n<p>village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold</p>",
        "<p>them into harmony and plenty.</p>\n<p>“he never failed to inform them”</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;</p>\n<p>and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one</p>\n<p>card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart</p>\n<p>of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living</p>",
        "<p>of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,</p>\n<p>however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time</p>\n<p>comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with</p>\n<p>Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she</p>\n<p>had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where</p>\n<p>she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was</p>\n<p>along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was</p>",
        "<p>a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and</p>\n<p>where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.</p>\n<p>In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.</p>\n<p>Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an</p>\n<p>addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be</p>\n<p>important. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy</p>\n<p>was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were</p>",
        "<p>not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would</p>\n<p>furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and</p>\n<p>she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him</p>\n<p>were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined</p>\n<p>by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest</p>\n<p>satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and</p>\n<p>seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by</p>",
        "<p>Miss Lucas and herself.</p>\n<p>His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking</p>\n<p>the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,</p>\n<p>in order to have</p>\n<p>“The gentlemen accompanied him.”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage</p>",
        "<p>turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the</p>\n<p>following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were</p>\n<p>two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought</p>\n<p>with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;</p>\n<p>and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,</p>\n<p>the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her</p>\n<p>husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the</p>",
        "<p>other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--</p>\n<p>“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would</p>\n<p>never have come so soon to wait upon me.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment</p>\n<p>before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly</p>\n<p>afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,</p>\n<p>who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and</p>",
        "<p>address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been</p>\n<p>used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual</p>\n<p>reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her</p>\n<p>friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely</p>\n<p>courtesied to him, without saying a word.</p>\n<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the</p>\n<p>readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but</p>",
        "<p>his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and</p>\n<p>garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.</p>\n<p>At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of</p>\n<p>Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual</p>\n<p>way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--</p>\n<p>“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never</p>\n<p>happened to see her there?”</p>",
        "<p>She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see</p>\n<p>whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the</p>\n<p>Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he</p>\n<p>answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The</p>\n<p>subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went</p>\n<p>away.</p>\n<p>“At Church”</p>",

        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>\n<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,</p>\n<p>and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of</p>\n<p>their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they</p>\n<p>received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the</p>\n<p>house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,</p>\n<p>almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by</p>",
        "<p>such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to</p>\n<p>come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little</p>\n<p>of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called</p>\n<p>at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had</p>\n<p>only seen at church.</p>\n<p>The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined</p>\n<p>the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them</p>",
        "<p>civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so</p>\n<p>acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,</p>\n<p>almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,</p>\n<p>much more than to any other person in the room.</p>\n<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a</p>\n<p>welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,</p>\n<p>moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and</p>",
        "<p>talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying</p>\n<p>at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so</p>\n<p>well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much</p>\n<p>spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as</p>\n<p>well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned</p>\n<p>towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a</p>\n<p>while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not</p>",
        "<p>scruple to call out,--</p>\n<p>“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking</p>\n<p>of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”</p>\n<p>“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid</p>\n<p>a reply.</p>\n<p>“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I</p>\n<p>must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.</p>",
        "<p>There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true</p>\n<p>enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever</p>\n<p>learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her</p>\n<p>health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have</p>\n<p>performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.</p>\n<p>“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady</p>",
        "<p>Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,</p>\n<p>if she does not practise a great deal.”</p>\n<p>“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.</p>\n<p>She practises very constantly.”</p>\n<p>“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write</p>\n<p>to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often</p>\n<p>tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without</p>",
        "<p>constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will</p>\n<p>never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.</p>\n<p>Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told</p>\n<p>her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.</p>\n<p>Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part</p>\n<p>of the house.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made</p>",
        "<p>no answer.</p>\n<p>When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having</p>\n<p>promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He</p>\n<p>drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then</p>\n<p>talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from</p>\n<p>her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,</p>\n<p>stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s</p>",
        "<p>countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first</p>\n<p>convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--</p>\n<p>“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear</p>\n<p>me. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.</p>\n<p>There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at</p>\n<p>the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to</p>\n<p>intimidate me.”</p>",
        "<p>“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could</p>\n<p>not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I</p>\n<p>have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you</p>\n<p>find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,</p>\n<p>are not your own.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to</p>\n<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of</p>",
        "<p>me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky</p>\n<p>in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a</p>\n<p>part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree</p>\n<p>of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention</p>\n<p>all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me</p>\n<p>leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,</p>\n<p>and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.</p>\n<p>“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel</p>\n<p>Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”</p>\n<p>“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The</p>\n<p>first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at</p>\n<p>a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four</p>\n<p>dances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four</p>",
        "<p>dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more</p>\n<p>than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,</p>\n<p>you cannot deny the fact.”</p>\n<p>“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly</p>\n<p>beyond my own party.”</p>\n<p>“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel</p>\n<p>Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”</p>",
        "<p>“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an</p>\n<p>introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”</p>\n<p>“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still</p>\n<p>addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and</p>\n<p>education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend</p>\n<p>himself to strangers?”</p>\n<p>“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to</p>",
        "<p>him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”</p>\n<p>“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,</p>\n<p>“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot</p>\n<p>catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their</p>\n<p>concerns, as I often see done.”</p>\n<p>“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the</p>\n<p>masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same</p>",
        "<p>force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I</p>\n<p>have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take</p>\n<p>the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers</p>\n<p>as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”</p>\n<p>Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your</p>\n<p>time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can</p>\n<p>think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”</p>",
        "<p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know</p>\n<p>what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said</p>\n<p>to Darcy,--</p>\n<p>“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and</p>\n<p>could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion</p>\n<p>of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have</p>",
        "<p>been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his</p>\n<p>cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she</p>\n<p>discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss</p>\n<p>De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have</p>\n<p>been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing</p>",
        "<p>with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received</p>\n<p>them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the</p>\n<p>gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was</p>\n<p>ready to take them all home.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,</p>\n<p>while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,</p>\n<p>when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a</p>\n<p>visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her</p>\n<p>half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,</p>",
        "<p>when the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy only, entered the room.</p>\n<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his</p>\n<p>intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to</p>\n<p>be within.</p>\n<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,</p>\n<p>seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely</p>",
        "<p>necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency</p>\n<p>recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling</p>\n<p>curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty</p>\n<p>departure, she observed,--</p>\n<p>“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!</p>\n<p>It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you</p>\n<p>all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day</p>",
        "<p>before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”</p>\n<p>“Perfectly so, I thank you.”</p>\n<p>She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short</p>\n<p>pause, added,--</p>\n<p>“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever</p>\n<p>returning to Netherfield again?”</p>\n<p>“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend</p>",
        "<p>very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is</p>\n<p>at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually</p>\n<p>increasing.”</p>\n<p>“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the</p>\n<p>neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we</p>\n<p>might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did</p>\n<p>not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as</p>",
        "<p>for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same</p>\n<p>principle.”</p>\n<p>“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as</p>\n<p>soon as any eligible purchase offers.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his</p>\n<p>friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the</p>\n<p>trouble of finding a subject to him.</p>",
        "<p>He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable</p>\n<p>house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins first came to Hunsford.”</p>\n<p>“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her</p>\n<p>kindness on a more grateful object.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of</p>",
        "<p>the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made</p>\n<p>him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though</p>\n<p>I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest</p>\n<p>thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a</p>\n<p>prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”</p>\n<p>“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a</p>\n<p>distance of her own family and friends.”</p>",
        "<p>“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”</p>\n<p>“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s</p>\n<p>journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”</p>\n<p>“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_</p>\n<p>of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins</p>\n<p>was settled _near_ her family.”</p>\n<p>“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond</p>",
        "<p>the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”</p>\n<p>As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she</p>\n<p>understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and</p>\n<p>Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--</p>\n<p>“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her</p>\n<p>family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many</p>\n<p>varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of</p>",
        "<p>travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the</p>\n<p>case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not</p>\n<p>such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my</p>\n<p>friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_</p>\n<p>the present distance.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot</p>\n<p>have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have</p>",
        "<p>been always at Longbourn.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of</p>\n<p>feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,</p>\n<p>glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--</p>\n<p>“Are you pleased with Kent?”</p>\n<p>A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side</p>\n<p>calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte</p>",
        "<p>and her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_</p>\n<p>surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his</p>\n<p>intruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,</p>\n<p>without saying much to anybody, went away.</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was</p>\n<p>gone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never</p>",
        "<p>have called on us in this familiar way.”</p>\n<p>But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,</p>\n<p>even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various</p>\n<p>conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from</p>\n<p>the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable</p>\n<p>from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there</p>\n<p>was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be</p>",
        "<p>always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the</p>\n<p>pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the</p>\n<p>two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither</p>\n<p>almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes</p>\n<p>separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their</p>\n<p>aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he</p>\n<p>had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended</p>",
        "<p>him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in</p>\n<p>being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former</p>\n<p>favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there</p>\n<p>was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she</p>\n<p>believed he might have the best informed mind.</p>\n<p>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult</p>\n<p>to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there</p>",
        "<p>ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it</p>\n<p>seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to</p>\n<p>propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really</p>\n<p>animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel</p>\n<p>Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was</p>\n<p>generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told</p>\n<p>her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of</p>",
        "<p>love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself</p>\n<p>seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at</p>\n<p>Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He</p>\n<p>certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that</p>\n<p>look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often</p>\n<p>doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it</p>\n<p>seemed nothing but absence of mind.</p>",
        "<p>She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his</p>\n<p>being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of</p>\n<p>raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her</p>\n<p>opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would</p>\n<p>vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.</p>\n<p>In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying</p>",
        "<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he</p>\n<p>certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,</p>\n<p>to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage</p>\n<p>in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h3>\n<p>More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,</p>\n<p>unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the</p>\n<p>mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to</p>\n<p>prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,</p>\n<p>that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,</p>\n<p>therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like</p>",
        "<p>wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was</p>\n<p>not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,</p>\n<p>but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He</p>\n<p>never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking</p>\n<p>or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third</p>\n<p>encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her</p>\n<p>pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her</p>",
        "<p>opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of</p>\n<p>Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to</p>\n<p>expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying</p>\n<p>_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel</p>\n<p>Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must</p>\n<p>mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her</p>\n<p>a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the</p>",
        "<p>pales opposite the Parsonage.</p>\n<p>She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last</p>\n<p>letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not</p>\n<p>written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,</p>\n<p>she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.</p>\n<p>Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--</p>\n<p>“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”</p>",
        "<p>“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally</p>\n<p>do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.</p>\n<p>Are you going much farther?”</p>\n<p>“No, I should have turned in a moment.”</p>\n<p>And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n<p>“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He</p>\n<p>arranges the business just as he pleases.”</p>\n<p>“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least</p>\n<p>great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems</p>\n<p>more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”</p>\n<p>“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.</p>\n<p>“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than</p>",
        "<p>many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak</p>\n<p>feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and</p>\n<p>dependence.”</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of</p>\n<p>either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and</p>\n<p>dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going</p>\n<p>wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”</p>",
        "<p>“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have</p>\n<p>experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater</p>\n<p>weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry</p>\n<p>where they like.”</p>\n<p>“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often</p>\n<p>do.”</p>\n<p>“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in</p>",
        "<p>my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to</p>\n<p>money.”</p>\n<p>“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the</p>\n<p>idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is</p>\n<p>the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is</p>\n<p>very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”</p>\n<p>He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt</p>",
        "<p>a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,</p>\n<p>she soon afterwards said,--</p>\n<p>“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of</p>\n<p>having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a</p>\n<p>lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well</p>\n<p>for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he</p>\n<p>likes with her.”</p>",
        "<p>“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must</p>\n<p>divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”</p>\n<p>“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does</p>\n<p>your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes</p>\n<p>a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she</p>\n<p>may like to have her own way.”</p>\n<p>As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner</p>",
        "<p>in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to</p>\n<p>give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other</p>\n<p>got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--</p>\n<p>“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare</p>\n<p>say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a</p>\n<p>very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”</p>",
        "<p>“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike</p>\n<p>man--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.</p>\n<p>Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”</p>\n<p>“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in</p>\n<p>those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me</p>\n<p>in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted</p>",
        "<p>to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose</p>\n<p>that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”</p>\n<p>“What is it you mean?”</p>\n<p>“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be</p>\n<p>generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it</p>\n<p>would be an unpleasant thing.”</p>\n<p>“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”</p>",
        "<p>“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be</p>\n<p>Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself</p>\n<p>on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most</p>\n<p>imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other</p>\n<p>particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him</p>\n<p>the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from</p>\n<p>knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”</p>",
        "<p>“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”</p>\n<p>“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the</p>\n<p>lady.”</p>\n<p>“And what arts did he use to separate them?”</p>\n<p>“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He</p>\n<p>only told me what I have now told you.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with</p>",
        "<p>indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she</p>\n<p>was so thoughtful.</p>\n<p>“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your</p>\n<p>cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the</p>\n<p>judge?”</p>\n<p>“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”</p>\n<p>“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his</p>",
        "<p>friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to</p>\n<p>determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”</p>\n<p>she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the</p>\n<p>particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed</p>\n<p>that there was much affection in the case.”</p>\n<p>“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is</p>\n<p>lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”</p>",
        "<p>This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,</p>\n<p>therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent</p>\n<p>matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,</p>\n<p>as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption</p>\n<p>of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other</p>\n<p>people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There</p>",
        "<p>could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have</p>\n<p>such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures</p>\n<p>taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she</p>\n<p>had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and</p>\n<p>arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,</p>\n<p>_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that</p>\n<p>Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a</p>",
        "<p>while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart</p>\n<p>in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have</p>\n<p>inflicted.</p>\n<p>“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel</p>\n<p>Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her</p>\n<p>having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in</p>\n<p>business in London.</p>",
        "<p>“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of</p>\n<p>objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding</p>\n<p>excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could</p>\n<p>anything be urged against my father, who, though with some</p>\n<p>peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,</p>\n<p>and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought</p>\n<p>of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would</p>",
        "<p>not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from</p>\n<p>the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want</p>\n<p>of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly</p>\n<p>governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of</p>\n<p>retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.</p>\n<p>The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a</p>",
        "<p>headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to</p>\n<p>her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her</p>\n<p>cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,</p>\n<p>seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much</p>\n<p>as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins</p>\n<p>could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather</p>\n<p>displeased by her staying at home.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>\n<p>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as</p>\n<p>much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the</p>\n<p>examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her</p>\n<p>being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any</p>\n<p>revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.</p>\n<p>But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that</p>",
        "<p>cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,</p>\n<p>proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly</p>\n<p>disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth</p>\n<p>noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an</p>\n<p>attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s</p>\n<p>shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a</p>\n<p>keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to</p>",
        "<p>think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,</p>\n<p>and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be</p>\n<p>with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her</p>\n<p>spirits, by all that affection could do.</p>\n<p>She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his</p>\n<p>cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear</p>\n<p>that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not</p>",
        "<p>mean to be unhappy about him.</p>\n<p>While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the</p>\n<p>door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its</p>\n<p>being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in</p>\n<p>the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But</p>\n<p>this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently</p>\n<p>affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the</p>",
        "<p>room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her</p>\n<p>health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.</p>\n<p>She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and</p>\n<p>then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but</p>\n<p>said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her</p>\n<p>in an agitated manner, and thus began:--</p>\n<p>“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be</p>",
        "<p>repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,</p>\n<p>doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,</p>\n<p>and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately</p>\n<p>followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the</p>\n<p>heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of</p>",
        "<p>tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a</p>\n<p>degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed</p>\n<p>to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the</p>\n<p>consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his</p>\n<p>suit.</p>\n<p>In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to</p>\n<p>the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did</p>",
        "<p>not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to</p>\n<p>receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost</p>\n<p>all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to</p>\n<p>answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with</p>\n<p>representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of</p>\n<p>all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with</p>\n<p>expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of</p>",
        "<p>his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a</p>\n<p>favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his</p>\n<p>countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only</p>\n<p>exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks</p>\n<p>and she said,--</p>\n<p>“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to</p>\n<p>express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however</p>",
        "<p>unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be</p>\n<p>felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I</p>\n<p>cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly</p>\n<p>bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to</p>\n<p>anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be</p>\n<p>of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented</p>\n<p>the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in</p>",
        "<p>overcoming it after this explanation.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed</p>\n<p>on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than</p>\n<p>surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of</p>\n<p>his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the</p>\n<p>appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed</p>\n<p>himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings</p>",
        "<p>dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--</p>\n<p>“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I</p>\n<p>might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at</p>\n<p>civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”</p>\n<p>“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design</p>\n<p>of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me</p>\n<p>against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?</p>",
        "<p>Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have</p>\n<p>other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided</p>\n<p>against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been</p>\n<p>favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept</p>\n<p>the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the</p>\n<p>happiness of a most beloved sister?”</p>\n<p>As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion</p>",
        "<p>was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she</p>\n<p>continued,--</p>\n<p>“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can</p>\n<p>excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,</p>\n<p>you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means</p>\n<p>of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the</p>\n<p>world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for</p>",
        "<p>disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest</p>\n<p>kind.”</p>\n<p>She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening</p>\n<p>with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.</p>\n<p>He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.</p>\n<p>“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.</p>\n<p>With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying</p>",
        "<p>that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your</p>\n<p>sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been</p>\n<p>kinder than towards myself.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,</p>\n<p>but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.</p>\n<p>“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike</p>\n<p>is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was</p>",
        "<p>decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received</p>\n<p>many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to</p>\n<p>say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?</p>\n<p>or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”</p>\n<p>“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,</p>\n<p>in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.</p>\n<p>“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an</p>",
        "<p>interest in him?”</p>\n<p>“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his</p>\n<p>misfortunes have been great indeed.”</p>\n<p>“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have</p>\n<p>reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You</p>\n<p>have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed</p>\n<p>for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that</p>",
        "<p>independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done</p>\n<p>all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with</p>\n<p>contempt and ridicule.”</p>\n<p>“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,</p>\n<p>“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I</p>\n<p>thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this</p>\n<p>calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his</p>",
        "<p>walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been</p>\n<p>overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the</p>\n<p>scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These</p>\n<p>bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater</p>\n<p>policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my</p>\n<p>being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by</p>\n<p>reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.</p>",
        "<p>Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.</p>\n<p>Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your</p>\n<p>connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose</p>\n<p>condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to</p>\n<p>the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--</p>\n<p>“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your</p>",
        "<p>declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the</p>\n<p>concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a</p>\n<p>more gentlemanlike manner.”</p>\n<p>She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--</p>\n<p>“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way</p>\n<p>that would have tempted me to accept it.”</p>\n<p>Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an</p>",
        "<p>expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--</p>\n<p>“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my</p>\n<p>acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest</p>\n<p>belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the</p>\n<p>feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of</p>\n<p>disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a</p>\n<p>dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the</p>",
        "<p>last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”</p>\n<p>“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your</p>\n<p>feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.</p>\n<p>Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best</p>\n<p>wishes for your health and happiness.”</p>\n<p>And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him</p>\n<p>the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of</p>",
        "<p>her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,</p>\n<p>and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her</p>\n<p>astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by</p>\n<p>every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!</p>\n<p>so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections</p>\n<p>which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which</p>",
        "<p>must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost</p>\n<p>incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong</p>\n<p>an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal</p>\n<p>of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in</p>\n<p>acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner</p>\n<p>which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not</p>\n<p>attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his</p>",
        "<p>attachment had for a moment excited.</p>\n<p>She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter</p>\n<p>Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.</p>\n<p>“Hearing herself called”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXV.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations</p>\n<p>which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the</p>\n<p>surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything</p>\n<p>else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after</p>\n<p>breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding</p>\n<p>directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s</p>",
        "<p>sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,</p>\n<p>she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The</p>\n<p>park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one</p>\n<p>of the gates into the ground.</p>\n<p>After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was</p>\n<p>tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and</p>\n<p>look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had</p>",
        "<p>made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the</p>\n<p>verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her</p>\n<p>walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove</p>\n<p>which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was</p>\n<p>now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,</p>\n<p>pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,</p>",
        "<p>though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again</p>\n<p>towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out</p>\n<p>a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty</p>\n<p>composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of</p>\n<p>meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and</p>\n<p>then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon</p>\n<p>out of sight.</p>",
        "<p>With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,</p>\n<p>Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,</p>\n<p>perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written</p>\n<p>quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise</p>\n<p>full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated</p>\n<p>from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--</p>\n<p>“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of</p>",
        "<p>its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those</p>\n<p>offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any</p>\n<p>intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,</p>\n<p>which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the</p>\n<p>effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,</p>\n<p>should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written</p>\n<p>and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand</p>",
        "<p>your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I</p>\n<p>demand it of your justice.</p>\n<p>“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal</p>\n<p>magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,</p>\n<p>that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley</p>\n<p>from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various</p>\n<p>claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate</p>",
        "<p>prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and</p>\n<p>wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged</p>\n<p>favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other</p>\n<p>dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect</p>\n<p>its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young</p>\n<p>persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could</p>\n<p>bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last</p>",
        "<p>night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope</p>\n<p>to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and</p>\n<p>their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due</p>\n<p>to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be</p>\n<p>offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must</p>\n<p>be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in</p>\n<p>Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley</p>",
        "<p>preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But</p>\n<p>it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any</p>\n<p>apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him</p>\n<p>in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with</p>\n<p>you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental</p>\n<p>information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to</p>\n<p>a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain</p>",
        "<p>event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I</p>\n<p>observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive</p>\n<p>that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed</p>\n<p>in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,</p>\n<p>cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar</p>\n<p>regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that</p>\n<p>though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite</p>",
        "<p>them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken</p>\n<p>here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your</p>\n<p>sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled</p>\n<p>by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been</p>\n<p>unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of</p>\n<p>your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most</p>\n<p>acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart</p>",
        "<p>was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing</p>\n<p>her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my</p>\n<p>investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or</p>\n<p>fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I</p>\n<p>believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.</p>\n<p>My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night</p>\n<p>acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside</p>",
        "<p>in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to</p>\n<p>my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes</p>\n<p>which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both</p>\n<p>instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not</p>\n<p>immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The</p>\n<p>situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in</p>\n<p>comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost</p>",
        "<p>uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and</p>\n<p>occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend</p>\n<p>you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,</p>\n<p>and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you</p>\n<p>consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid</p>\n<p>any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on</p>\n<p>you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and</p>",
        "<p>disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed</p>\n<p>that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every</p>\n<p>inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my</p>\n<p>friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left</p>\n<p>Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,</p>\n<p>remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is</p>\n<p>now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited</p>",
        "<p>with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike</p>\n<p>sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we</p>\n<p>shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly</p>\n<p>went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my</p>\n<p>friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them</p>\n<p>earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed</p>\n<p>his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have</p>",
        "<p>prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which</p>\n<p>I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before</p>\n<p>believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,</p>\n<p>regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger</p>\n<p>dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,</p>\n<p>that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade</p>\n<p>him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been</p>",
        "<p>given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for</p>\n<p>having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole</p>\n<p>affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I</p>\n<p>condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him</p>\n<p>your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss</p>\n<p>Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might</p>\n<p>have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard</p>",
        "<p>did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some</p>\n<p>danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is</p>\n<p>done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have</p>\n<p>nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your</p>\n<p>sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which</p>\n<p>governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not</p>\n<p>yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty</p>",
        "<p>accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by</p>\n<p>laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he</p>\n<p>has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I</p>\n<p>shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.</p>\n<p>Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years</p>\n<p>the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in</p>\n<p>the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service</p>",
        "<p>to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was</p>\n<p>therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and</p>\n<p>afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,</p>\n<p>always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to</p>\n<p>give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this</p>\n<p>young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the</p>\n<p>highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,</p>",
        "<p>intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years</p>\n<p>since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The</p>\n<p>vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to</p>\n<p>guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the</p>\n<p>observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who</p>\n<p>had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy</p>\n<p>could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you</p>",
        "<p>only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has</p>\n<p>created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding</p>\n<p>his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father</p>\n<p>died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the</p>\n<p>last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to</p>\n<p>promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might</p>\n<p>allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living</p>",
        "<p>might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of</p>\n<p>one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and</p>\n<p>within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me</p>\n<p>that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should</p>\n<p>not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate</p>\n<p>pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be</p>\n<p>benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I</p>",
        "<p>must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very</p>\n<p>insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be</p>\n<p>sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his</p>\n<p>proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The</p>\n<p>business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance</p>\n<p>in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to</p>\n<p>receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection</p>",
        "<p>between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him</p>\n<p>to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he</p>\n<p>chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being</p>\n<p>now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and</p>\n<p>dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the</p>\n<p>decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,</p>\n<p>he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His</p>",
        "<p>circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,</p>\n<p>were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,</p>\n<p>and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present</p>\n<p>him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little</p>\n<p>doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,</p>\n<p>and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will</p>\n<p>hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for</p>",
        "<p>resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to</p>\n<p>the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in</p>\n<p>his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this</p>\n<p>period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I</p>\n<p>know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my</p>\n<p>notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget</p>\n<p>myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me</p>",
        "<p>to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of</p>\n<p>your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left</p>\n<p>to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and</p>\n<p>myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an</p>\n<p>establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with</p>\n<p>the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.</p>\n<p>Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior</p>",
        "<p>acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were</p>\n<p>most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far</p>\n<p>recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a</p>\n<p>strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was</p>\n<p>persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She</p>\n<p>was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her</p>\n<p>imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to</p>",
        "<p>herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended</p>\n<p>elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving</p>\n<p>and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,</p>\n<p>acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I</p>\n<p>acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public</p>\n<p>exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,</p>\n<p>and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s</p>",
        "<p>chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty</p>\n<p>thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging</p>\n<p>himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been</p>\n<p>complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in</p>\n<p>which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely</p>\n<p>reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty</p>\n<p>towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of</p>",
        "<p>falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be</p>\n<p>wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning</p>\n<p>either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly</p>\n<p>not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not</p>\n<p>told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know</p>\n<p>what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here</p>\n<p>related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel</p>",
        "<p>Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and</p>\n<p>still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been</p>\n<p>unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If</p>\n<p>your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you</p>\n<p>cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and</p>\n<p>that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour</p>\n<p>to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the</p>",
        "<p>course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.</p>\n<p>“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to</p>\n<p>contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of</p>\n<p>its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly</p>\n<p>she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.</p>\n<p>Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did</p>\n<p>she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;</p>",
        "<p>and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to</p>\n<p>give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong</p>\n<p>prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of</p>\n<p>what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which</p>\n<p>hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing</p>\n<p>what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the</p>\n<p>sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s</p>",
        "<p>insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the</p>\n<p>real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any</p>\n<p>wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done</p>\n<p>which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all</p>\n<p>pride and insolence.</p>\n<p>But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when</p>\n<p>she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,</p>",
        "<p>if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which</p>\n<p>bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings</p>\n<p>were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.</p>\n<p>Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished</p>\n<p>to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!</p>\n<p>This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had</p>\n<p>gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the</p>",
        "<p>last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not</p>\n<p>regard it, that she would never look in it again.</p>\n<p>In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on</p>\n<p>nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter</p>\n<p>was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she</p>\n<p>again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and</p>\n<p>commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.</p>",
        "<p>The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly</p>\n<p>what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,</p>\n<p>though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his</p>\n<p>own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to</p>\n<p>the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living</p>\n<p>was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was</p>\n<p>impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the</p>",
        "<p>other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did</p>\n<p>not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the</p>\n<p>particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions</p>\n<p>to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three</p>\n<p>thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the</p>\n<p>letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be</p>\n<p>impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with</p>",
        "<p>little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.</p>\n<p>But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had</p>\n<p>believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to</p>\n<p>render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a</p>\n<p>turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.</p>\n<p>The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to</p>\n<p>Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could</p>",
        "<p>bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his</p>\n<p>entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the</p>\n<p>persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,</p>\n<p>had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,</p>\n<p>nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told</p>\n<p>“Meeting accidentally in Town”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<p>himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,</p>\n<p>she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and</p>\n<p>manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.</p>\n<p>She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished</p>\n<p>trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the</p>\n<p>attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone</p>\n<p>for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’</p>\n<p>continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him</p>\n<p>instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could</p>\n<p>remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the</p>\n<p>neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in</p>\n<p>the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once</p>\n<p>more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his</p>",
        "<p>designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed</p>\n<p>between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at</p>\n<p>last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel</p>\n<p>Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the</p>\n<p>information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose</p>\n<p>character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost</p>\n<p>resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness</p>",
        "<p>of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been</p>\n<p>well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.</p>\n<p>She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation</p>\n<p>between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.</p>\n<p>Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_</p>\n<p>struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and</p>",
        "<p>wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting</p>\n<p>himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions</p>\n<p>with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear</p>\n<p>of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that</p>\n<p>_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball</p>\n<p>the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield</p>\n<p>family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but</p>",
        "<p>herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;</p>\n<p>that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s</p>\n<p>character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would</p>\n<p>always prevent his exposing the son.</p>\n<p>How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His</p>\n<p>attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and</p>\n<p>hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer</p>",
        "<p>the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.</p>\n<p>His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had</p>\n<p>either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying</p>\n<p>his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most</p>\n<p>incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter</p>\n<p>and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not</p>\n<p>but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago</p>",
        "<p>asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as</p>\n<p>were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their</p>\n<p>acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much</p>\n<p>together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything</p>\n<p>that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him</p>\n<p>of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was</p>\n<p>esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a</p>",
        "<p>brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his</p>\n<p>sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his</p>\n<p>actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of</p>\n<p>everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and</p>\n<p>that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man</p>\n<p>as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.</p>\n<p>She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham</p>",
        "<p>could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,</p>\n<p>prejudiced, absurd.</p>\n<p>“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on</p>\n<p>my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have</p>\n<p>often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my</p>\n<p>vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this</p>\n<p>discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not</p>",
        "<p>have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my</p>\n<p>folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect</p>\n<p>of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted</p>\n<p>prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were</p>\n<p>concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”</p>\n<p>From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line</p>\n<p>which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation</p>",
        "<p>_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely</p>\n<p>different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that</p>\n<p>credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to</p>\n<p>give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious</p>\n<p>of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what</p>\n<p>Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice</p>\n<p>of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though</p>",
        "<p>fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant</p>\n<p>complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great</p>\n<p>sensibility.</p>\n<p>When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were</p>\n<p>mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense</p>\n<p>of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly</p>\n<p>for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as</p>",
        "<p>having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first</p>\n<p>disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind</p>\n<p>than on hers.</p>\n<p>The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but</p>\n<p>it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus</p>\n<p>self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that</p>\n<p>Jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest</p>",
        "<p>relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt</p>\n<p>by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she</p>\n<p>had ever known before.</p>\n<p>After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every</p>\n<p>variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and</p>\n<p>reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so</p>\n<p>important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at</p>",
        "<p>length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing</p>\n<p>cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as</p>\n<p>must make her unfit for conversation.</p>\n<p>She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each</p>\n<p>called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take</p>\n<p>leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least</p>\n<p>an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her</p>",
        "<p>till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in</p>\n<p>missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no</p>\n<p>longer an object. She could think only of her letter.</p>\n<p>“His parting obeisance”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h3>\n<p>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having</p>\n<p>been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was</p>\n<p>able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very</p>\n<p>good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the</p>\n<p>melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then</p>\n<p>hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return</p>",
        "<p>brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,</p>\n<p>importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of</p>\n<p>having them all to dine with her.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had</p>\n<p>she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her</p>\n<p>future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her</p>\n<p>Ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how</p>",
        "<p>would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused</p>\n<p>herself.</p>\n<p>Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure</p>\n<p>you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody</p>\n<p>feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly</p>\n<p>attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!</p>\n<p>They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear</p>",
        "<p>Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy</p>\n<p>seemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His</p>\n<p>attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which</p>\n<p>were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of</p>\n<p>spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that</p>",
        "<p>she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--</p>\n<p>“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you</p>\n<p>may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your</p>\n<p>company, I am sure.”</p>\n<p>“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied</p>\n<p>Elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town</p>\n<p>next Saturday.”</p>",
        "<p>“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected</p>\n<p>you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There</p>\n<p>can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly</p>\n<p>spare you for another fortnight.”</p>\n<p>“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”</p>\n<p>“Dawson”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.</p>\n<p>Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will</p>\n<p>stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you</p>\n<p>as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and</p>\n<p>as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good</p>\n<p>room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be</p>\n<p>cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you</p>",
        "<p>large.”</p>\n<p>“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our</p>\n<p>original plan.”</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant</p>\n<p>with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea</p>\n<p>of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.</p>\n<p>You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the</p>",
        "<p>world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly</p>\n<p>guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my</p>\n<p>niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her</p>\n<p>having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with</p>\n<p>propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those</p>\n<p>things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am</p>",
        "<p>glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be</p>\n<p>discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”</p>\n<p>“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you</p>\n<p>have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?</p>\n<p>Oh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be</p>\n<p>attended to.”</p>",
        "<p>Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;</p>\n<p>and as she did not answer them all herself attention was</p>\n<p>necessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a</p>\n<p>mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection</p>\n<p>must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave</p>\n<p>way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a</p>\n<p>solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of</p>",
        "<p>unpleasant recollections.</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She</p>\n<p>studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at</p>\n<p>times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,</p>\n<p>she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly</p>\n<p>she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against</p>\n<p>herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.</p>",
        "<p>His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she</p>\n<p>could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or</p>\n<p>feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past</p>\n<p>behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in</p>\n<p>the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.</p>\n<p>They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at</p>\n<p>them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his</p>",
        "<p>youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right</p>\n<p>herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently</p>\n<p>united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine</p>\n<p>and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,</p>\n<p>what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,</p>\n<p>irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always</p>\n<p>affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would</p>",
        "<p>scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While</p>\n<p>there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while</p>\n<p>Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for</p>\n<p>ever.</p>\n<p>Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s</p>\n<p>explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,</p>\n<p>heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to</p>",
        "<p>have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any</p>\n<p>could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How</p>\n<p>grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every</p>\n<p>respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had</p>\n<p>been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!</p>\n<p>When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s</p>\n<p>character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had</p>",
        "<p>seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it</p>\n<p>almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.</p>\n<p>Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of</p>\n<p>her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent</p>\n<p>there; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of</p>\n<p>their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,</p>\n<p>and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right</p>",
        "<p>way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the</p>\n<p>work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.</p>\n<p>When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them</p>\n<p>a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;</p>\n<p>and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out</p>\n<p>her hand to both.</p>\n<p>“The elevation of his feelings.”</p>",
        "<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h3>\n<p>On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few</p>\n<p>minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of</p>\n<p>paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.</p>\n<p>“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet</p>\n<p>expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very</p>\n<p>certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for</p>",
        "<p>it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know</p>\n<p>how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain</p>\n<p>manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we</p>\n<p>see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like</p>\n<p>yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,</p>\n<p>and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending</p>\n<p>your time unpleasantly.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had</p>\n<p>spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with</p>\n<p>Charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel</p>\n<p>the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling</p>\n<p>solemnity replied,--</p>\n<p>“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your</p>\n<p>time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most</p>",
        "<p>fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior</p>\n<p>society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of</p>\n<p>varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that</p>\n<p>your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation</p>\n<p>with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of</p>\n<p>extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on</p>\n<p>what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In</p>",
        "<p>truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this</p>\n<p>humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of</p>\n<p>compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”</p>\n<p>Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was</p>\n<p>obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility</p>\n<p>and truth in a few short sentences.</p>\n<p>“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into</p>",
        "<p>Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will</p>\n<p>be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you</p>\n<p>have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear</p>\n<p>that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be</p>\n<p>as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in</p>\n<p>marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of</p>",
        "<p>thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of</p>\n<p>character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each</p>\n<p>other.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was</p>\n<p>the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed</p>\n<p>and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to</p>\n<p>have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from</p>",
        "<p>whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such</p>\n<p>society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently</p>\n<p>regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for</p>\n<p>compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,</p>\n<p>and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.</p>\n<p>At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels</p>\n<p>placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate</p>",
        "<p>parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning</p>\n<p>her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks</p>\n<p>for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his</p>\n<p>compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed</p>\n<p>her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,</p>\n<p>when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had</p>",
        "<p>hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.</p>\n<p>“They had forgotten to leave any message”</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects</p>\n<p>delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you</p>\n<p>while you have been here.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and</p>",
        "<p>the carriage drove off.</p>\n<p>“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems</p>\n<p>but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have</p>\n<p>happened!”</p>\n<p>“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.</p>\n<p>“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!</p>\n<p>How much I shall have to tell!”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”</p>\n<p>Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and</p>\n<p>within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s</p>\n<p>house, where they were to remain a few days.</p>\n<p>Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her</p>\n<p>spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt</p>\n<p>had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at</p>",
        "<p>Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.</p>\n<p>It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for</p>\n<p>Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know</p>\n<p>that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish</p>\n<p>Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own</p>\n<p>vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation</p>\n<p>to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision</p>",
        "<p>in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,</p>\n<p>and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into</p>\n<p>repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister</p>\n<p>further.</p>\n<p>“How nicely we are crammed in”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h3>\n<p>It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out</p>\n<p>together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;</p>\n<p>and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was</p>\n<p>to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s</p>\n<p>punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.</p>\n<p>These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed</p>",
        "<p>in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and</p>\n<p>dressing a salad and cucumber.</p>\n<p>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set</p>\n<p>out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,</p>\n<p>“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”</p>\n<p>“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the</p>\n<p>money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing</p>",
        "<p>her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it</p>\n<p>is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall</p>\n<p>pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any</p>\n<p>better.”</p>\n<p>And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect</p>\n<p>unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and</p>\n<p>when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I</p>",
        "<p>think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what</p>\n<p>one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they</p>\n<p>are going in a fortnight.”</p>\n<p>“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.</p>\n<p>“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to</p>\n<p>take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,</p>\n<p>and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to</p>",
        "<p>go, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall</p>\n<p>have!”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,</p>\n<p>and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole</p>\n<p>campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor</p>\n<p>regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”</p>\n<p>“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to</p>",
        "<p>table. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about</p>\n<p>a certain person that we all like.”</p>\n<p>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he</p>\n<p>need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--</p>\n<p>“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the</p>\n<p>waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse</p>\n<p>things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad</p>",
        "<p>he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for</p>\n<p>my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?</p>\n<p>There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She</p>\n<p>is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”</p>\n<p>“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection</p>\n<p>imprudent as to fortune.”</p>\n<p>“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”</p>",
        "<p>“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.</p>\n<p>“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared</p>\n<p>three straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled</p>\n<p>thing?”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such</p>\n<p>coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_</p>\n<p>was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied</p>",
        "<p>liberal!</p>\n<p>As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was</p>\n<p>ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their</p>\n<p>boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and</p>\n<p>Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.</p>\n<p>“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my</p>\n<p>bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now</p>",
        "<p>let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way</p>\n<p>home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all</p>\n<p>since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any</p>\n<p>flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband</p>\n<p>before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.</p>\n<p>She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not</p>\n<p>being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to</p>",
        "<p>get husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!</p>\n<p>how I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would</p>\n<p>_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece</p>\n<p>of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend</p>\n<p>the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the</p>\n<p>evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so</p>",
        "<p>she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen</p>\n<p>was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We</p>\n<p>dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a</p>\n<p>lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow</p>\n<p>one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,</p>\n<p>and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they</p>",
        "<p>did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.</p>\n<p>Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect</p>\n<p>something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”</p>\n<p>With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,</p>\n<p>assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her</p>\n<p>companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she</p>\n<p>could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.</p>",
        "<p>Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane</p>\n<p>in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet</p>\n<p>say voluntarily to Elizabeth,----</p>\n<p>“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”</p>\n<p>Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases</p>\n<p>came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects</p>\n<p>which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the</p>",
        "<p>table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet</p>\n<p>was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present</p>\n<p>fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,</p>\n<p>retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice</p>\n<p>rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various</p>\n<p>pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!</p>",
        "<p>as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended</p>\n<p>there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if</p>\n<p>Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we</p>\n<p>behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest</p>\n<p>cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have</p>\n<p>treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought</p>\n<p>we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.</p>",
        "<p>And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so</p>\n<p>loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”</p>\n<p>To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,</p>\n<p>to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the</p>\n<p>generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for</p>\n<p>_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”</p>\n<p>But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to</p>",
        "<p>anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to</p>\n<p>Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed</p>\n<p>the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at</p>\n<p>home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was</p>\n<p>another reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham</p>\n<p>again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to</p>",
        "<p>_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond</p>\n<p>expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped</p>\n<p>there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.</p>\n<p>She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton</p>\n<p>scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under</p>\n<p>frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her</p>\n<p>father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were</p>",
        "<p>at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often</p>\n<p>disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XL.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no</p>\n<p>longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular</p>\n<p>in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,</p>\n<p>she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy and herself.</p>\n<p>Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly</p>",
        "<p>partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly</p>\n<p>natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was</p>\n<p>sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so</p>\n<p>little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the</p>\n<p>unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.</p>\n<p>“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly</p>\n<p>ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his</p>",
        "<p>disappointment.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has</p>\n<p>other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.</p>\n<p>You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”</p>\n<p>“Blame you! Oh, no.”</p>\n<p>“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”</p>\n<p>“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”</p>",
        "<p>“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very</p>\n<p>next day.”</p>\n<p>She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far</p>\n<p>as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,</p>\n<p>who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that</p>\n<p>so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here</p>\n<p>collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though</p>",
        "<p>grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.</p>\n<p>Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and</p>\n<p>seek to clear one, without involving the other.</p>\n<p>“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both</p>\n<p>of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied</p>\n<p>with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just</p>\n<p>enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting</p>",
        "<p>about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”</p>\n<p>It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.</p>\n<p>“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so</p>\n<p>very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,</p>\n<p>only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and</p>\n<p>with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a</p>",
        "<p>thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must</p>\n<p>feel it so.”</p>\n<p>“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full</p>\n<p>of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing</p>\n<p>every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me</p>\n<p>saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as</p>\n<p>light as a feather.”</p>",
        "<p>“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his</p>\n<p>countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”</p>\n<p>“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those</p>\n<p>two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the</p>\n<p>appearance of it.”</p>\n<p>“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you</p>\n<p>used to do.”</p>",
        "<p>“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike</p>\n<p>to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an</p>\n<p>opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually</p>\n<p>abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing</p>\n<p>at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”</p>\n<p>“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat</p>\n<p>the matter as you do now.”</p>",
        "<p>“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very</p>\n<p>uncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I</p>\n<p>felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,</p>\n<p>and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”</p>\n<p>“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions</p>\n<p>in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly</p>\n<p>undeserved.”</p>",
        "<p>“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most</p>\n<p>natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is</p>\n<p>one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I</p>\n<p>ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand</p>\n<p>Wickham’s character.”</p>\n<p>Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no</p>\n<p>occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”</p>",
        "<p>“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to</p>\n<p>make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular</p>\n<p>relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to</p>\n<p>myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his</p>\n<p>conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is</p>\n<p>so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in</p>\n<p>Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to</p>",
        "<p>it. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to</p>\n<p>anybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found</p>\n<p>out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.</p>\n<p>At present I will say nothing about it.”</p>\n<p>“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for</p>\n<p>ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to</p>\n<p>re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”</p>",
        "<p>The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She</p>\n<p>had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a</p>\n<p>fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she</p>\n<p>might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something</p>\n<p>lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not</p>\n<p>relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister</p>\n<p>how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in</p>",
        "<p>which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than</p>\n<p>a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in</p>\n<p>throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if</p>\n<p>that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be</p>\n<p>able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner</p>\n<p>himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost</p>\n<p>all its value!”</p>",
        "<p>She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real</p>\n<p>state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a</p>\n<p>very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in</p>\n<p>love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from</p>\n<p>her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often</p>\n<p>boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to</p>\n<p>every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the</p>",
        "<p>feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those</p>\n<p>regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their</p>\n<p>tranquillity.</p>\n<p>“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of</p>\n<p>this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak</p>\n<p>of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I</p>\n<p>cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a</p>",
        "<p>very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least</p>\n<p>chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his</p>\n<p>coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of</p>\n<p>everybody, too, who is likely to know.”</p>\n<p>“I am determined never to speak of it again”</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I</p>\n<p>shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was</p>\n<p>her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure</p>\n<p>Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he</p>\n<p>has done.”</p>\n<p>But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she</p>\n<p>made no answer.</p>",
        "<p>“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the</p>\n<p>Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it</p>\n<p>will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an</p>\n<p>excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,</p>\n<p>she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_</p>\n<p>housekeeping, I dare say.”</p>\n<p>“No, nothing at all.”</p>",
        "<p>“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will</p>\n<p>take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed</p>\n<p>for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often</p>\n<p>talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it</p>\n<p>quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”</p>\n<p>“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”</p>\n<p>“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt they</p>",
        "<p>often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an</p>\n<p>estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be</p>\n<p>ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”</p>\n<p>“When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XLI.</h3>\n<p>The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was</p>\n<p>the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in</p>\n<p>the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost</p>\n<p>universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,</p>\n<p>and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very</p>\n<p>frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and</p>",
        "<p>Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such</p>\n<p>hard-heartedness in any of the family.</p>\n<p>“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they</p>\n<p>often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,</p>\n<p>Lizzy?”</p>\n<p>Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what</p>\n<p>she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.</p>",
        "<p>“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel</p>\n<p>Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”</p>\n<p>“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.</p>\n<p>“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.</p>\n<p>“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”</p>\n<p>“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”</p>\n<p>“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”</p>",
        "<p>added Kitty.</p>\n<p>Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through</p>\n<p>Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense</p>\n<p>of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s</p>\n<p>objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his</p>\n<p>interference in the views of his friend.</p>\n<p>But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she</p>",
        "<p>received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the</p>\n<p>regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a</p>\n<p>very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour</p>\n<p>and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of</p>\n<p>their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.</p>\n<p>The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,</p>\n<p>the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely</p>",
        "<p>to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew</p>\n<p>about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s</p>\n<p>congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;</p>\n<p>whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate</p>\n<p>in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.</p>\n<p>“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”</p>\n<p>said she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much</p>",
        "<p>right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”</p>\n<p>In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make</p>\n<p>her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from</p>\n<p>exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she</p>\n<p>considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense</p>\n<p>for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it</p>\n<p>known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her</p>",
        "<p>go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general</p>\n<p>behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of</p>\n<p>such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more</p>\n<p>imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must</p>\n<p>be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--</p>\n<p>“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public</p>\n<p>place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little</p>",
        "<p>expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present</p>\n<p>circumstances.”</p>\n<p>“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to</p>\n<p>us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and</p>\n<p>imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you</p>\n<p>would judge differently in the affair.”</p>\n<p>“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away</p>",
        "<p>some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such</p>\n<p>squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity</p>\n<p>are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows</p>\n<p>who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not</p>\n<p>of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our</p>\n<p>importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the</p>",
        "<p>wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark</p>\n<p>Lydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear</p>\n<p>father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and</p>\n<p>of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of</p>\n<p>her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character</p>\n<p>will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt</p>\n<p>that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the</p>",
        "<p>worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond</p>\n<p>youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of</p>\n<p>her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal</p>\n<p>contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty</p>\n<p>is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,</p>\n<p>ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you</p>\n<p>suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever</p>",
        "<p>they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the</p>\n<p>disgrace?”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,</p>\n<p>affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--</p>\n<p>“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,</p>\n<p>you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less</p>\n<p>advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly</p>",
        "<p>sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to</p>\n<p>Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will</p>\n<p>keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an</p>\n<p>object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance</p>\n<p>even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find</p>\n<p>women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being</p>\n<p>there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow</p>",
        "<p>many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest</p>\n<p>of her life.”</p>\n<p>With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion</p>\n<p>continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not</p>\n<p>in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.</p>\n<p>She was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over</p>\n<p>unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her</p>",
        "<p>disposition.</p>\n<p>Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her</p>\n<p>father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their</p>\n<p>united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised</p>\n<p>every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye</p>\n<p>of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.</p>\n<p>She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at</p>",
        "<p>present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents</p>\n<p>stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young</p>\n<p>and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she</p>\n<p>saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six</p>\n<p>officers at once.</p>\n<p>“Tenderly flirting”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<p>Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and</p>\n<p>such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could</p>\n<p>have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the</p>\n<p>same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the</p>\n<p>melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there</p>\n<p>himself.</p>\n<p>But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures</p>",
        "<p>continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving</p>\n<p>home.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been</p>\n<p>frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty</p>\n<p>well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even</p>\n<p>learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,</p>\n<p>an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present</p>",
        "<p>behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;</p>\n<p>for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which</p>\n<p>had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after</p>\n<p>what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in</p>\n<p>finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous</p>\n<p>gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the</p>\n<p>reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever</p>",
        "<p>cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,</p>\n<p>and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.</p>\n<p>On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,</p>\n<p>with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth</p>\n<p>disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some</p>\n<p>inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she</p>\n<p>mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three</p>",
        "<p>weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.</p>\n<p>He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s</p>\n<p>recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen</p>\n<p>him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,</p>\n<p>asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.</p>\n<p>With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you</p>\n<p>say that he was at Rosings?”</p>",
        "<p>“Nearly three weeks.”</p>\n<p>“And you saw him frequently?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, almost every day.”</p>\n<p>“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray</p>\n<p>may I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in</p>",
        "<p>address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his</p>\n<p>ordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more</p>\n<p>serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much</p>\n<p>what he ever was.”</p>\n<p>While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to</p>\n<p>rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a</p>",
        "<p>something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive</p>\n<p>and anxious attention, while she added,--</p>\n<p>“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that</p>\n<p>either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,</p>\n<p>from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”</p>\n<p>Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated</p>\n<p>look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his</p>",
        "<p>embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of</p>\n<p>accents,--</p>\n<p>“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily</p>\n<p>comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume</p>\n<p>even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,</p>\n<p>may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter</p>\n<p>him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that</p>",
        "<p>the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is</p>\n<p>merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and</p>\n<p>judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I</p>\n<p>know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his</p>\n<p>wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he</p>\n<p>has very much at heart.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a</p>",
        "<p>slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on</p>\n<p>the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge</p>\n<p>him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,</p>\n<p>of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish</p>\n<p>Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a</p>\n<p>mutual desire of never meeting again.</p>\n<p>When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,</p>",
        "<p>from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation</p>\n<p>between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the</p>\n<p>only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,</p>\n<p>and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the</p>\n<p>opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there</p>\n<p>was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous</p>",
        "<p>happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus</p>\n<p>of her sisters were uttered without being heard.</p>\n<p>The arrival of the</p>\n<p>Gardiners</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XLII.</h3>\n<p>Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could</p>\n<p>not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic</p>\n<p>comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance</p>\n<p>of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a</p>\n<p>woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in</p>\n<p>their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,</p>",
        "<p>esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of</p>\n<p>domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a</p>\n<p>disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own</p>\n<p>imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often</p>\n<p>console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of</p>\n<p>the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal</p>\n<p>enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as</p>",
        "<p>her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not</p>\n<p>the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his</p>\n<p>wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true</p>\n<p>philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her</p>\n<p>father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but</p>\n<p>respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of</p>",
        "<p>herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to</p>\n<p>banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation</p>\n<p>and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own</p>\n<p>children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so</p>\n<p>strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so</p>\n<p>unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising</p>\n<p>from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,</p>",
        "<p>might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even</p>\n<p>if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.</p>\n<p>When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little</p>\n<p>other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties</p>\n<p>abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and</p>\n<p>sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around</p>\n<p>them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty</p>",
        "<p>might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers</p>\n<p>of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition</p>\n<p>greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her</p>\n<p>folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a</p>\n<p>watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what</p>\n<p>has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked</p>\n<p>forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the</p>",
        "<p>satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to</p>\n<p>name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have</p>\n<p>some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by</p>\n<p>again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the</p>\n<p>present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes</p>\n<p>was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation</p>\n<p>for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother</p>",
        "<p>and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the</p>\n<p>scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.</p>\n<p>“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.</p>\n<p>Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.</p>\n<p>But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my</p>\n<p>sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of</p>\n<p>pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can</p>",
        "<p>never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by</p>\n<p>the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”</p>\n<p>When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely</p>\n<p>to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and</p>\n<p>always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that</p>\n<p>they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers</p>\n<p>had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as</p>",
        "<p>made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which</p>\n<p>she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a</p>\n<p>violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the</p>\n<p>camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less</p>\n<p>to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much</p>\n<p>too full of lines under the words to be made public.</p>\n<p>After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,</p>",
        "<p>good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything</p>\n<p>wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter</p>\n<p>came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle</p>\n<p>of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton</p>\n<p>without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth</p>\n<p>hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably</p>",
        "<p>reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by</p>\n<p>some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment</p>\n<p>should be quartered in Meryton.</p>\n<p>The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast</p>\n<p>approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter</p>\n<p>arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and</p>\n<p>curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from</p>",
        "<p>setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again</p>\n<p>within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so</p>\n<p>far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with</p>\n<p>the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up</p>\n<p>the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the</p>\n<p>present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that</p>\n<p>county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three</p>",
        "<p>weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The</p>\n<p>town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where</p>\n<p>they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of</p>\n<p>her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,</p>\n<p>Dovedale, or the Peak.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing</p>\n<p>the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it</p>",
        "<p>was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;</p>\n<p>and all was soon right again.</p>\n<p>With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was</p>\n<p>impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its</p>\n<p>owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,</p>\n<p>and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”</p>\n<p>The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away</p>",
        "<p>before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at</p>\n<p>Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two</p>\n<p>younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin</p>\n<p>Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and</p>\n<p>sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every</p>\n<p>way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.</p>",
        "<p>The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next</p>\n<p>morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One</p>\n<p>enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a</p>\n<p>suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear</p>\n<p>inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection</p>\n<p>and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were</p>\n<p>disappointments abroad.</p>",
        "<p>It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,</p>\n<p>nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither</p>\n<p>lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are</p>\n<p>sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present</p>\n<p>concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s</p>\n<p>former residence, and where she had lately learned that some</p>\n<p>acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen</p>",
        "<p>all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of</p>\n<p>Lambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It</p>\n<p>was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In</p>\n<p>talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an</p>\n<p>inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his</p>\n<p>willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.</p>\n<p>“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so</p>",
        "<p>much?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your</p>\n<p>acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you</p>\n<p>know.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at</p>\n<p>Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She</p>\n<p>must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,</p>\n<p>she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house</p>\n<p>richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the</p>\n<p>grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the</p>\n<p>country.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The</p>\n<p>possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly</p>\n<p>occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and</p>",
        "<p>thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such</p>\n<p>a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved</p>\n<p>that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the</p>\n<p>absence of the family were unfavourably answered.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid</p>\n<p>whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its</p>\n<p>proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for</p>",
        "<p>the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her</p>\n<p>alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of</p>\n<p>curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the</p>\n<p>next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and</p>\n<p>with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike</p>\n<p>to the scheme.</p>\n<p>To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.</p>",
        "<p>“Conjecturing as to the date”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XLIII.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of</p>\n<p>Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned</p>\n<p>in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.</p>\n<p>The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They</p>\n<p>entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through</p>\n<p>a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired</p>\n<p>every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for</p>\n<p>half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable</p>\n<p>eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by</p>\n<p>Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which</p>\n<p>the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone</p>\n<p>building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high</p>",
        "<p>woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was</p>\n<p>swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks</p>\n<p>were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She</p>\n<p>had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural</p>\n<p>beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were</p>\n<p>all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that</p>\n<p>to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!</p>",
        "<p>They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,</p>\n<p>while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of</p>\n<p>meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been</p>\n<p>mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the</p>\n<p>hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to</p>\n<p>wonder at her being where she was.</p>\n<p>The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less</p>",
        "<p>fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They</p>\n<p>followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned</p>\n<p>room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went</p>\n<p>to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from</p>\n<p>which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the</p>\n<p>distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was</p>\n<p>good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered</p>",
        "<p>on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace</p>\n<p>it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were</p>\n<p>taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties</p>\n<p>to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture</p>\n<p>suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with</p>\n<p>admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly</p>\n<p>fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the</p>",
        "<p>furniture of Rosings.</p>\n<p>“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With</p>\n<p>these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of</p>\n<p>viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and</p>\n<p>welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting</p>\n<p>herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to</p>\n<p>me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”</p>",
        "<p>This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.</p>\n<p>She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really</p>\n<p>absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was</p>\n<p>asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds</p>\n<p>replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large</p>\n<p>party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had</p>\n<p>not by any circumstance been delayed a day!</p>",
        "<p>Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw</p>\n<p>the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other</p>\n<p>miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how</p>\n<p>she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the</p>\n<p>picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who</p>\n<p>had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the</p>\n<p>army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not</p>\n<p>return it.</p>\n<p>“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,</p>\n<p>“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the</p>\n<p>other--about eight years ago.”</p>\n<p>“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,</p>\n<p>looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell</p>",
        "<p>us whether it is like or not.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this</p>\n<p>intimation of her knowing her master.</p>\n<p>“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”</p>\n<p>“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, very handsome.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you</p>\n<p>will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late</p>\n<p>master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to</p>\n<p>be then. He was very fond of them.”</p>\n<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn</p>\n<p>when she was only eight years old.</p>",
        "<p>“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so</p>\n<p>accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a</p>\n<p>new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she</p>\n<p>comes here to-morrow with him.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her</p>\n<p>communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either</p>",
        "<p>from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her</p>\n<p>master and his sister.</p>\n<p>“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”</p>\n<p>“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his</p>\n<p>time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”</p>\n<p>“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”</p>\n<p>“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is</p>\n<p>good enough for him.”</p>\n<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is</p>\n<p>very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”</p>\n<p>“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows</p>\n<p>him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;</p>\n<p>and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,</p>",
        "<p>“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him</p>\n<p>ever since he was four years old.”</p>\n<p>This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her</p>\n<p>ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.</p>\n<p>Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was</p>\n<p>grateful to her uncle for saying,--</p>\n<p>“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in</p>",
        "<p>having such a master.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not</p>\n<p>meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are</p>\n<p>good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he</p>\n<p>was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the</p>\n<p>world.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.</p>",
        "<p>“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.</p>\n<p>“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just</p>\n<p>as affable to the poor.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.</p>\n<p>Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects</p>\n<p>of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the</p>\n<p>furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family</p>",
        "<p>prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her</p>\n<p>master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his</p>\n<p>many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.</p>\n<p>“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever</p>\n<p>lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but</p>\n<p>themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will</p>\n<p>give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never</p>",
        "<p>saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle</p>\n<p>away like other young men.”</p>\n<p>“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not</p>\n<p>quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps we might be deceived.”</p>\n<p>“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”</p>",
        "<p>On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty</p>\n<p>sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than</p>\n<p>the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to</p>\n<p>give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when</p>\n<p>last at Pemberley.</p>\n<p>“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards</p>\n<p>one of the windows.</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter</p>\n<p>the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever</p>\n<p>can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There</p>\n<p>is nothing he would not do for her.”</p>\n<p>The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were</p>\n<p>all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:</p>\n<p>but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already</p>",
        "<p>visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss</p>\n<p>Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and</p>\n<p>also more intelligible.</p>\n<p>In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have</p>\n<p>little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest</p>\n<p>of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it</p>\n<p>arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with</p>",
        "<p>such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,</p>\n<p>when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in</p>\n<p>earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the</p>\n<p>gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his</p>\n<p>father’s lifetime.</p>\n<p>There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle</p>\n<p>sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of</p>",
        "<p>their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds</p>\n<p>was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise</p>\n<p>of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she</p>\n<p>considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How</p>\n<p>much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good</p>\n<p>or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by</p>\n<p>the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before</p>",
        "<p>the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon</p>\n<p>herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude</p>\n<p>than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened</p>\n<p>its impropriety of expression.</p>\n<p>When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,</p>\n<p>they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were</p>\n<p>consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.</p>",
        "<p>As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back</p>\n<p>to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was</p>\n<p>conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself</p>\n<p>suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.</p>\n<p>They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his</p>\n<p>appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes</p>\n<p>instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest</p>",
        "<p>blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from</p>\n<p>surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,</p>\n<p>and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least</p>\n<p>of perfect civility.</p>\n<p>She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,</p>\n<p>received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be</p>\n<p>overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture</p>",
        "<p>they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two</p>\n<p>that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on</p>\n<p>beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little</p>\n<p>aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,</p>\n<p>scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she</p>\n<p>returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the</p>\n<p>alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he</p>",
        "<p>uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the</p>\n<p>impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few</p>\n<p>minutes in which they continued together were some of the most</p>\n<p>uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he</p>\n<p>spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his</p>\n<p>inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay</p>\n<p>in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the</p>",
        "<p>distraction of his thoughts.</p>\n<p>At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few</p>\n<p>moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took</p>\n<p>leave.</p>\n<p>The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his</p>\n<p>figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own</p>\n<p>feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and</p>",
        "<p>vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged</p>\n<p>thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a</p>\n<p>disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if</p>\n<p>she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?</p>\n<p>or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been</p>\n<p>only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his</p>\n<p>discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that</p>",
        "<p>moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and</p>\n<p>again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so</p>\n<p>strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to</p>\n<p>her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her</p>\n<p>family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,</p>\n<p>never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.</p>\n<p>What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when</p>",
        "<p>he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to</p>\n<p>account for it.</p>\n<p>They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and</p>\n<p>every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer</p>\n<p>reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time</p>\n<p>before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered</p>\n<p>mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed</p>",
        "<p>to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she</p>\n<p>distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that</p>\n<p>one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then</p>\n<p>was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in</p>\n<p>what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,</p>\n<p>she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he</p>\n<p>felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was</p>",
        "<p>not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing</p>\n<p>her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with</p>\n<p>composure.</p>\n<p>At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind</p>\n<p>roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.</p>\n<p>They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,</p>\n<p>ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening</p>",
        "<p>of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of</p>\n<p>the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods</p>\n<p>overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner</p>\n<p>expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be</p>\n<p>beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten</p>\n<p>miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed</p>\n<p>circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among</p>",
        "<p>hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.</p>\n<p>They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of</p>\n<p>the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and</p>\n<p>the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the</p>\n<p>stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered</p>\n<p>it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed</p>\n<p>the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,</p>",
        "<p>who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of</p>\n<p>returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,</p>\n<p>therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house</p>\n<p>on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their</p>\n<p>progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the</p>\n<p>taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the</p>\n<p>occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man</p>",
        "<p>about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this</p>\n<p>slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was</p>\n<p>quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy</p>\n<p>approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less</p>\n<p>sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they</p>\n<p>met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an</p>\n<p>interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with</p>",
        "<p>calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,</p>\n<p>she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea</p>\n<p>lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the</p>\n<p>turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that</p>\n<p>he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,</p>\n<p>she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not</p>\n<p>got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky</p>",
        "<p>recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from</p>\n<p>her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said</p>\n<p>no more.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked</p>\n<p>her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.</p>\n<p>This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and</p>\n<p>she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the</p>",
        "<p>acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had</p>\n<p>revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought</p>\n<p>she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of</p>\n<p>fashion.”</p>\n<p>The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their</p>\n<p>relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore</p>\n<p>it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he</p>",
        "<p>could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the</p>\n<p>connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,</p>\n<p>so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into</p>\n<p>conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,</p>\n<p>could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some</p>\n<p>relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most</p>\n<p>attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every</p>",
        "<p>expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,</p>\n<p>his taste, or his good manners.</p>\n<p>The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy</p>\n<p>invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he</p>\n<p>chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same</p>\n<p>time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of</p>\n<p>the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was</p>",
        "<p>walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her</p>\n<p>wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the</p>\n<p>compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was</p>\n<p>extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From</p>\n<p>what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake</p>\n<p>that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not</p>\n<p>work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love</p>",
        "<p>me.”</p>\n<p>After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two</p>\n<p>gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the</p>\n<p>brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious</p>\n<p>water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred</p>",
        "<p>her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on</p>\n<p>together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to</p>\n<p>know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the</p>\n<p>place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been</p>\n<p>very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that</p>\n<p>you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we</p>\n<p>left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in</p>",
        "<p>the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that</p>\n<p>business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours</p>\n<p>before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They</p>\n<p>will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some</p>\n<p>who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly</p>\n<p>driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned</p>",
        "<p>between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was</p>\n<p>not very differently engaged.</p>\n<p>“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a</p>\n<p>pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow</p>\n<p>me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance</p>\n<p>during your stay at Lambton?”</p>\n<p>The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great</p>",
        "<p>for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt</p>\n<p>that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,</p>\n<p>must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was</p>\n<p>satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made</p>\n<p>him think really ill of her.</p>\n<p>They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth</p>\n<p>was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and</p>",
        "<p>pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of</p>\n<p>the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had</p>\n<p>reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a</p>\n<p>mile behind.</p>\n<p>He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not</p>\n<p>tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might</p>\n<p>have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but</p>",
        "<p>there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that</p>\n<p>she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with</p>\n<p>great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience</p>\n<p>and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.</p>\n<p>On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into</p>\n<p>the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they</p>\n<p>parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the</p>",
        "<p>ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him</p>\n<p>walking slowly towards the house.</p>\n<p>The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them</p>\n<p>pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.</p>\n<p>“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.</p>\n<p>“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her</p>\n<p>aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now</p>",
        "<p>say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,</p>\n<p>_I_ have seen nothing of it.”</p>\n<p>“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more</p>\n<p>than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such</p>\n<p>attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”</p>\n<p>“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;</p>\n<p>or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are</p>",
        "<p>perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so</p>\n<p>disagreeable?”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked</p>\n<p>him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never</p>\n<p>seen him so pleasant as this morning.</p>\n<p>“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied</p>\n<p>her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him</p>",
        "<p>at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and</p>\n<p>warn me off his grounds.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said</p>\n<p>nothing.</p>\n<p>“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really</p>\n<p>should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by</p>\n<p>anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.</p>",
        "<p>On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he</p>\n<p>speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would</p>\n<p>not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the</p>\n<p>good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!</p>\n<p>I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal</p>\n<p>master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends</p>\n<p>every virtue.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of</p>\n<p>his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as</p>\n<p>guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his</p>\n<p>relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different</p>\n<p>construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor</p>\n<p>Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In</p>\n<p>confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary</p>",
        "<p>transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming</p>\n<p>her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now</p>\n<p>approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to</p>\n<p>the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out</p>\n<p>to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of</p>\n<p>anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had</p>",
        "<p>no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former</p>\n<p>acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an</p>\n<p>intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.</p>\n<p>The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth</p>\n<p>much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing</p>\n<p>but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above</p>\n<p>all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XLIV.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit</p>\n<p>her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,</p>\n<p>resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.</p>\n<p>But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own</p>\n<p>arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the</p>\n<p>place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn</p>",
        "<p>to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a</p>\n<p>carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a</p>\n<p>curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the</p>\n<p>livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise</p>\n<p>to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she</p>\n<p>expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment</p>\n<p>of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many</p>",
        "<p>of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on</p>\n<p>the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt</p>\n<p>that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such</p>\n<p>a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these</p>\n<p>newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed</p>\n<p>at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she</p>",
        "<p>dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in</p>\n<p>her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally</p>\n<p>suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.</p>\n<p>She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked</p>\n<p>up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of</p>\n<p>inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.</p>\n<p>Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction</p>",
        "<p>took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new</p>\n<p>acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her</p>\n<p>being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;</p>\n<p>but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was</p>\n<p>only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from</p>\n<p>her beyond a monosyllable.</p>\n<p>Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though</p>",
        "<p>little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance</p>\n<p>womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there</p>\n<p>was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly</p>\n<p>unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as</p>\n<p>acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much</p>\n<p>relieved by discerning such different feelings.</p>\n<p>They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was</p>",
        "<p>also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her</p>\n<p>satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step</p>\n<p>was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still</p>\n<p>felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected</p>\n<p>cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He</p>\n<p>inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and</p>",
        "<p>looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.</p>\n<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage</p>\n<p>than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before</p>\n<p>them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just</p>\n<p>arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards</p>\n<p>each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from</p>\n<p>those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what</p>",
        "<p>it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in</p>\n<p>doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was</p>\n<p>evident enough.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the</p>\n<p>feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to</p>\n<p>make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she</p>\n<p>feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom</p>",
        "<p>she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.</p>\n<p>Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be</p>\n<p>pleased.</p>\n<p>“To make herself agreeable to all”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!</p>\n<p>how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a</p>",
        "<p>like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on</p>\n<p>former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion</p>\n<p>that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,</p>\n<p>though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his</p>\n<p>behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No</p>\n<p>look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing</p>\n<p>occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On</p>",
        "<p>this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances</p>\n<p>occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted</p>\n<p>a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of</p>\n<p>saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He</p>\n<p>observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and</p>\n<p>in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long</p>\n<p>time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could</p>",
        "<p>reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the</p>\n<p>26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards</p>\n<p>took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether</p>\n<p>_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,</p>\n<p>nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which</p>\n<p>gave them meaning.</p>",
        "<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but</p>\n<p>whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general</p>\n<p>complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far</p>\n<p>removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her</p>\n<p>that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,</p>\n<p>however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one</p>\n<p>day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the</p>",
        "<p>good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would</p>\n<p>have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,</p>\n<p>but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected</p>\n<p>their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the</p>\n<p>change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could</p>\n<p>hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the</p>\n<p>company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations</p>",
        "<p>at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from</p>\n<p>self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could</p>\n<p>result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the</p>\n<p>acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw</p>\n<p>down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and</p>\n<p>Rosings.</p>\n<p>Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose</p>",
        "<p>to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing</p>\n<p>their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner</p>\n<p>at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a</p>\n<p>diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,</p>\n<p>readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing</p>\n<p>how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its</p>\n<p>acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,</p>",
        "<p>that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than</p>\n<p>any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of</p>\n<p>society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for</p>\n<p>her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.</p>\n<p>Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth</p>\n<p>again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to</p>\n<p>make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all</p>",
        "<p>this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and</p>\n<p>on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their</p>\n<p>visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some</p>\n<p>satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been</p>\n<p>little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her</p>\n<p>uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their</p>\n<p>favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.</p>",
        "<p>But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was</p>\n<p>not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was</p>\n<p>much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;</p>\n<p>it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to</p>\n<p>interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.</p>\n<p>Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far</p>\n<p>as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could</p>",
        "<p>not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character</p>\n<p>from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference</p>\n<p>to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known</p>\n<p>would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,</p>\n<p>however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible</p>\n<p>that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four</p>\n<p>years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be</p>",
        "<p>hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of</p>\n<p>their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had</p>\n<p>nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,</p>\n<p>it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town</p>\n<p>where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he</p>\n<p>was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.</p>\n<p>With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held</p>",
        "<p>there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the</p>\n<p>son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known</p>\n<p>fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind</p>\n<p>him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.</p>\n<p>As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than</p>\n<p>the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not</p>\n<p>long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and</p>",
        "<p>she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She</p>\n<p>certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she</p>\n<p>had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,</p>\n<p>that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his</p>\n<p>valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some</p>\n<p>time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened</p>\n<p>into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his</p>",
        "<p>favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,</p>\n<p>which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,</p>\n<p>there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be</p>\n<p>overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once</p>\n<p>loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the</p>\n<p>petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the</p>\n<p>unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been</p>",
        "<p>persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this</p>\n<p>accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and</p>\n<p>without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,</p>\n<p>where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good</p>\n<p>opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such</p>\n<p>a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but</p>\n<p>gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as</p>",
        "<p>such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no</p>\n<p>means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,</p>\n<p>she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his</p>\n<p>welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to</p>\n<p>depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both</p>\n<p>that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still</p>\n<p>possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.</p>",
        "<p>It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that</p>\n<p>such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very</p>\n<p>day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late</p>\n<p>breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by</p>\n<p>some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it</p>\n<p>would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following</p>\n<p>morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when</p>",
        "<p>she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been</p>\n<p>renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting</p>\n<p>some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.</p>\n<p>“Engaged by the river”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XLV.</h3>\n<p>Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had</p>\n<p>originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome</p>\n<p>her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know</p>\n<p>with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now</p>\n<p>be renewed.</p>\n<p>On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,</p>",
        "<p>whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,</p>\n<p>opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody</p>\n<p>hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts</p>\n<p>which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.</p>\n<p>In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there</p>\n<p>with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in</p>\n<p>London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with</p>",
        "<p>all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the</p>\n<p>fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves</p>\n<p>inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and</p>\n<p>her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.</p>\n<p>By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and</p>\n<p>on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,</p>\n<p>succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a</p>",
        "<p>genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind</p>\n<p>of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the</p>\n<p>others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she</p>\n<p>wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a</p>\n<p>short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,</p>",
        "<p>and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without</p>\n<p>calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her</p>\n<p>from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an</p>\n<p>inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity</p>\n<p>of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every</p>\n<p>moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she</p>\n<p>feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether</p>",
        "<p>she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After</p>\n<p>sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss</p>\n<p>Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold</p>\n<p>inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal</p>\n<p>indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.</p>\n<p>The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the</p>\n<p>entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the</p>",
        "<p>finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a</p>\n<p>significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been</p>\n<p>given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole</p>\n<p>party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the</p>\n<p>beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected</p>\n<p>them round the table.</p>\n<p>While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether</p>",
        "<p>she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the</p>\n<p>feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but</p>\n<p>a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to</p>\n<p>regret that he came.</p>\n<p>He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other</p>\n<p>gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him</p>\n<p>only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to</p>",
        "<p>Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely</p>\n<p>resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more</p>\n<p>necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she</p>\n<p>saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,</p>\n<p>and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour</p>\n<p>when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive</p>\n<p>curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the</p>",
        "<p>smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its</p>\n<p>objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions</p>\n<p>to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s</p>\n<p>entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he</p>\n<p>was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,</p>\n<p>as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss</p>\n<p>Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the</p>",
        "<p>first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--</p>\n<p>“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?</p>\n<p>They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”</p>\n<p>In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth</p>\n<p>instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the</p>\n<p>various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;</p>\n<p>but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she</p>",
        "<p>presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While</p>\n<p>she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened</p>\n<p>complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with</p>\n<p>confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what</p>\n<p>pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have</p>\n<p>refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed</p>",
        "<p>her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in</p>\n<p>Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies</p>\n<p>and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with</p>\n<p>that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s</p>\n<p>meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy</p>\n<p>was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections</p>\n<p>her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish</p>",
        "<p>which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming</p>\n<p>hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without</p>\n<p>meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss</p>\n<p>Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern</p>\n<p>for the welfare of his friend.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and</p>\n<p>as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to</p>",
        "<p>Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able</p>\n<p>to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely</p>\n<p>recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which</p>\n<p>had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have</p>\n<p>fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.</p>\n<p>Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above</p>\n<p>mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,</p>",
        "<p>Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s</p>\n<p>person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her</p>\n<p>brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment</p>\n<p>could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave</p>\n<p>Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and</p>\n<p>amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help</p>\n<p>repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.</p>",
        "<p>“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I</p>\n<p>never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.</p>\n<p>She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we</p>\n<p>should not have known her again.”</p>\n<p>However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented</p>\n<p>himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than</p>\n<p>her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the</p>",
        "<p>summer.</p>\n<p>“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see</p>\n<p>any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no</p>\n<p>brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants</p>\n<p>character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are</p>\n<p>tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which</p>\n<p>have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything</p>",
        "<p>extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not</p>\n<p>like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency</p>\n<p>without fashion, which is intolerable.”</p>\n<p>Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not</p>\n<p>the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always</p>\n<p>wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the</p>\n<p>success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a</p>",
        "<p>determination of making him speak, she continued,--</p>\n<p>“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all</p>\n<p>were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect</p>\n<p>your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_</p>\n<p>a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she</p>\n<p>seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at</p>\n<p>one time.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_</p>\n<p>was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have</p>\n<p>considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”</p>\n<p>He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of</p>\n<p>having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their</p>\n<p>visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them</p>",
        "<p>both. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,</p>\n<p>except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked</p>\n<p>of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but</p>\n<p>himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of</p>\n<p>him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s</p>\n<p>beginning the subject.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter XLVI.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from</p>\n<p>Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been</p>\n<p>renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on</p>\n<p>the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the</p>\n<p>receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that</p>\n<p>it had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as</p>",
        "<p>Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.</p>\n<p>They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her</p>\n<p>uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by</p>\n<p>themselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been</p>\n<p>written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their</p>\n<p>little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;</p>\n<p>but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident</p>",
        "<p>agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--</p>\n<p>“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a</p>\n<p>most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be</p>\n<p>assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.</p>\n<p>An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,</p>\n<p>from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland</p>\n<p>with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our</p>",
        "<p>surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am</p>\n<p>very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing</p>\n<p>to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.</p>\n<p>Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and</p>\n<p>let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is</p>\n<p>disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.</p>\n<p>Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How</p>",
        "<p>thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against</p>\n<p>him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about</p>\n<p>twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at</p>\n<p>eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have</p>\n<p>passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect</p>\n<p>him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of</p>\n<p>their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor</p>",
        "<p>mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly</p>\n<p>know what I have written.”</p>\n<p>Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing</p>\n<p>what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the</p>\n<p>other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it</p>\n<p>had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.</p>\n<p>“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I</p>",
        "<p>wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my</p>\n<p>head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest</p>\n<p>Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,</p>\n<p>and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham</p>\n<p>and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has</p>\n<p>taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone</p>\n<p>to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the</p>",
        "<p>day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short</p>\n<p>letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna</p>\n<p>Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.</p>\n<p>never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated</p>\n<p>to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,</p>\n<p>intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but</p>\n<p>no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a</p>",
        "<p>hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.</p>\n<p>All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the</p>\n<p>London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible</p>\n<p>inquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,</p>\n<p>anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet</p>\n<p>and Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to</p>\n<p>pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and</p>",
        "<p>broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.</p>\n<p>I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any</p>\n<p>blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and</p>\n<p>mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many</p>\n<p>circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married</p>\n<p>privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_</p>\n<p>could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,</p>",
        "<p>which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?</p>\n<p>Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed</p>\n<p>to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my</p>\n<p>hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother</p>\n<p>is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be</p>\n<p>better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in</p>\n<p>my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed</p>",
        "<p>their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot</p>\n<p>wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared</p>\n<p>something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is</p>\n<p>over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,</p>\n<p>however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen</p>\n<p>again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances</p>\n<p>are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as</p>",
        "<p>soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not</p>\n<p>afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of</p>\n<p>the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,</p>\n<p>to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but</p>\n<p>his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the</p>\n<p>best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton</p>\n<p>again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and</p>",
        "<p>assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately</p>\n<p>comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat</p>\n<p>as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a</p>\n<p>moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was</p>\n<p>opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and</p>\n<p>impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself</p>",
        "<p>enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s</p>\n<p>situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.</p>\n<p>I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;</p>\n<p>I have not an instant to lose.”</p>\n<p>“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than</p>\n<p>politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;</p>\n<p>but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are</p>",
        "<p>not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how</p>\n<p>little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back</p>\n<p>the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an</p>\n<p>accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and</p>\n<p>mistress home instantly.</p>\n<p>On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and</p>",
        "<p>looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,</p>\n<p>or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,</p>\n<p>“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you</p>\n<p>present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”</p>\n<p>“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There</p>\n<p>is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by</p>\n<p>some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”</p>",
        "<p>She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could</p>\n<p>not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say</p>\n<p>something indistinctly of his</p>\n<p>“I have not an instant to lose”</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke</p>\n<p>again. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It</p>",
        "<p>cannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her</p>\n<p>friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.</p>\n<p>Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too</p>\n<p>well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that</p>\n<p>can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”</p>\n<p>Darcy was fixed in astonishment.</p>\n<p>“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_</p>",
        "<p>might have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained</p>\n<p>some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had</p>\n<p>his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,</p>\n<p>all too late now.”</p>\n<p>“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it</p>\n<p>certain, absolutely certain?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced</p>",
        "<p>almost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to</p>\n<p>Scotland.”</p>\n<p>“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”</p>\n<p>“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s</p>\n<p>immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But</p>\n<p>nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is</p>\n<p>such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have</p>",
        "<p>not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”</p>\n<p>Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.</p>\n<p>“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what</p>\n<p>I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too</p>\n<p>much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”</p>\n<p>Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up</p>\n<p>and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air</p>",
        "<p>gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power</p>\n<p>was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family</p>\n<p>weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither</p>\n<p>wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing</p>\n<p>consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It</p>\n<p>was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own</p>\n<p>wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved</p>",
        "<p>him, as now, when all love must be vain.</p>\n<p>But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the</p>\n<p>humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up</p>\n<p>every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of</p>\n<p>several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the</p>\n<p>voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke</p>",
        "<p>compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--</p>\n<p>“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything</p>\n<p>to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.</p>\n<p>Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,</p>\n<p>that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment</p>\n<p>you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.</p>\n<p>This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the</p>",
        "<p>pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that</p>\n<p>urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as</p>\n<p>long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”</p>\n<p>He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for</p>\n<p>her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present</p>\n<p>reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with</p>",
        "<p>only one serious parting look, went away.</p>\n<p>As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they</p>\n<p>should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had</p>\n<p>marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a</p>\n<p>retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of</p>\n<p>contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those</p>\n<p>feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would</p>",
        "<p>formerly have rejoiced in its termination.</p>\n<p>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s</p>\n<p>change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if</p>\n<p>otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or</p>\n<p>unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a</p>\n<p>first interview with its object, and even before two words have been</p>\n<p>exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given</p>",
        "<p>somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,</p>\n<p>and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other</p>\n<p>less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go</p>\n<p>with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must</p>\n<p>produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched</p>\n<p>business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a</p>\n<p>hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,</p>",
        "<p>could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least</p>\n<p>of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first</p>\n<p>letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,</p>\n<p>that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry</p>\n<p>for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared</p>\n<p>incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment</p>\n<p>as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not</p>",
        "<p>suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the</p>\n<p>intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither</p>\n<p>her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy</p>\n<p>prey.</p>\n<p>She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that</p>\n<p>Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had</p>\n<p>wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one</p>",
        "<p>officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions</p>\n<p>raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually</p>\n<p>fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and</p>\n<p>mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now</p>\n<p>feel it!</p>\n<p>She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to</p>\n<p>share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a</p>",
        "<p>family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and</p>\n<p>requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing</p>\n<p>could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost</p>\n<p>importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience</p>\n<p>was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,</p>\n<p>by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but</p>\n<p>satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the</p>",
        "<p>cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on</p>\n<p>the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never</p>\n<p>been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be</p>\n<p>deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after</p>\n<p>the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily</p>\n<p>promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no</p>\n<p>less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated</p>",
        "<p>by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily</p>\n<p>settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be</p>\n<p>done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was</p>\n<p>here when you sent for us;--was it so?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.</p>\n<p>_That_ is all settled.”</p>\n<p>“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to</p>",
        "<p>prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real</p>\n<p>truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”</p>\n<p>But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the</p>\n<p>hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure</p>\n<p>to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was</p>\n<p>impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of</p>\n<p>business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to</p>",
        "<p>be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their</p>\n<p>sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.</p>\n<p>Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing</p>\n<p>remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of</p>\n<p>the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could</p>\n<p>have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.</p>\n<p>“The first pleasing earnest of their welcome”</p>",
        "<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XLVII.</h3>\n<p>“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they</p>\n<p>drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much</p>\n<p>more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the</p>\n<p>matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form</p>\n<p>such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or</p>\n<p>friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I</p>",
        "<p>am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends</p>\n<p>would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the</p>\n<p>regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is</p>\n<p>not adequate to the risk.”</p>\n<p>“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.</p>\n<p>“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s</p>\n<p>opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and</p>",
        "<p>interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of</p>\n<p>Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe</p>\n<p>him capable of it?”</p>\n<p>“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect</p>\n<p>I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not</p>\n<p>hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the</p>\n<p>case?”</p>",
        "<p>“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof</p>\n<p>that they are not gone to Scotland.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a</p>\n<p>presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the</p>\n<p>Barnet road.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though</p>\n<p>for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is</p>",
        "<p>not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it</p>\n<p>might strike them that they could be more economically, though less</p>\n<p>expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”</p>\n<p>“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their</p>\n<p>marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular</p>\n<p>friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending</p>\n<p>to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He</p>",
        "<p>cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she</p>\n<p>beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake</p>\n<p>forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what</p>\n<p>restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a</p>\n<p>dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know</p>\n<p>nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your</p>\n<p>other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no</p>",
        "<p>brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s</p>\n<p>behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever</p>\n<p>seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would</p>\n<p>do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in</p>\n<p>such a matter.”</p>\n<p>“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,</p>\n<p>as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”</p>",
        "<p>“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with</p>\n<p>tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such</p>\n<p>a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never</p>\n<p>been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,</p>\n<p>nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement</p>\n<p>and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle</p>",
        "<p>and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.</p>\n<p>Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,</p>\n<p>flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing</p>\n<p>everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give</p>\n<p>greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which</p>\n<p>are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every</p>\n<p>charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”</p>",
        "<p>“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of</p>\n<p>Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”</p>\n<p>“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be</p>\n<p>their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,</p>\n<p>till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what</p>\n<p>Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every</p>\n<p>sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is</p>",
        "<p>as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”</p>\n<p>“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity</p>\n<p>as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.</p>\n<p>“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day</p>\n<p>of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at</p>\n<p>Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with</p>\n<p>such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other</p>",
        "<p>circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to</p>\n<p>relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From</p>\n<p>what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,</p>\n<p>reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He</p>\n<p>must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found</p>\n<p>her.”</p>\n<p>“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you</p>",
        "<p>and Jane seem so well to understand?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw</p>\n<p>so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was</p>\n<p>ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire</p>\n<p>was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the</p>\n<p>case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it</p>\n<p>necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it</p>",
        "<p>apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the</p>\n<p>neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it</p>\n<p>was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of</p>\n<p>opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could</p>\n<p>be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a</p>\n<p>consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far</p>\n<p>enough from my thoughts.”</p>",
        "<p>“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I</p>\n<p>suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”</p>\n<p>“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either</p>\n<p>side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware</p>\n<p>that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first</p>\n<p>he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all</p>\n<p>were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for</p>",
        "<p>the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular</p>\n<p>attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and</p>\n<p>wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,</p>\n<p>who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”</p>\n<p>It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added</p>\n<p>to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by</p>\n<p>its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during</p>",
        "<p>the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.</p>\n<p>Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could</p>\n<p>find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.</p>\n<p>They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on</p>\n<p>the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort</p>\n<p>to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long</p>\n<p>expectations.</p>",
        "<p>The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing</p>\n<p>on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the</p>\n<p>carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their</p>\n<p>faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of</p>\n<p>capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,</p>\n<p>hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from</p>",
        "<p>her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the</p>\n<p>eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been</p>\n<p>heard of the fugitives.</p>\n<p>“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope</p>\n<p>everything will be well.”</p>\n<p>“Is my father in town?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”</p>\n<p>“And have you heard from him often?”</p>\n<p>“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say</p>\n<p>that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I</p>\n<p>particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write</p>\n<p>again, till he had something of importance to mention.”</p>\n<p>“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”</p>",
        "<p>“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly</p>\n<p>shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you</p>\n<p>all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank</p>\n<p>Heaven! are quite well.”</p>\n<p>“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you</p>\n<p>must have gone through!”</p>\n<p>Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their</p>",
        "<p>conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were</p>\n<p>engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of</p>\n<p>the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and</p>\n<p>thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.</p>\n<p>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth</p>\n<p>had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon</p>\n<p>found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,</p>",
        "<p>however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet</p>\n<p>deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that</p>\n<p>every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,</p>\n<p>to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’</p>\n<p>conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with</p>\n<p>tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous</p>",
        "<p>conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;</p>\n<p>blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the</p>\n<p>errors of her daughter must be principally owing.</p>\n<p>“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton</p>\n<p>with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia</p>\n<p>had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out</p>\n<p>of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their</p>",
        "<p>side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had</p>\n<p>been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have</p>\n<p>the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear</p>\n<p>child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight</p>\n<p>Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is</p>\n<p>to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold</p>\n<p>in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what</p>",
        "<p>we shall do.”</p>\n<p>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after</p>\n<p>general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her</p>\n<p>that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.</p>\n<p>Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.</p>\n<p>“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be</p>\n<p>prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.</p>",
        "<p>It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we</p>\n<p>may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,</p>\n<p>and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as</p>\n<p>lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him</p>\n<p>come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult</p>\n<p>together as to what is to be done.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I</p>",
        "<p>could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,</p>\n<p>wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them</p>\n<p>marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but</p>\n<p>tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,</p>\n<p>after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from</p>\n<p>fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened</p>\n<p>out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,</p>",
        "<p>such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my</p>\n<p>heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear</p>\n<p>Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,</p>\n<p>for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how</p>\n<p>kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”</p>\n<p>But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours</p>\n<p>in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in</p>",
        "<p>her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till</p>\n<p>dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the</p>\n<p>housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.</p>\n<p>Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real</p>\n<p>occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to</p>\n<p>oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her</p>\n<p>tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it</p>",
        "<p>better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could</p>\n<p>most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the</p>\n<p>subject.</p>\n<p>In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been</p>\n<p>too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance</p>\n<p>before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The</p>\n<p>faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible</p>",
        "<p>in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger</p>\n<p>which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more</p>\n<p>of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was</p>\n<p>mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance</p>\n<p>of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--</p>\n<p>“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.</p>\n<p>But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of</p>",
        "<p>each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”</p>\n<p>Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,</p>\n<p>“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful</p>\n<p>lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one</p>\n<p>false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less</p>\n<p>brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in</p>\n<p>her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to</p>\n<p>make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such</p>\n<p>kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an</p>\n<p>hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the</p>\n<p>opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to</p>\n<p>satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel</p>",
        "<p>of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss</p>\n<p>Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued</p>\n<p>the subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I</p>\n<p>have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel</p>\n<p>Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement</p>\n<p>took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”</p>\n<p>“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,</p>",
        "<p>especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so</p>\n<p>grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He</p>\n<p>_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had</p>\n<p>any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension</p>\n<p>first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”</p>\n<p>“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of</p>\n<p>their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of</p>\n<p>their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not</p>\n<p>repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am</p>\n<p>inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”</p>\n<p>“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a</p>\n<p>doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”</p>\n<p>“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a</p>",
        "<p>little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in</p>\n<p>marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite</p>\n<p>right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how</p>\n<p>imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural</p>\n<p>triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter</p>\n<p>she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their</p>\n<p>being in love with each other many weeks.”</p>",
        "<p>“But not before they went to Brighton?”</p>\n<p>“No, I believe not.”</p>\n<p>“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he</p>\n<p>know his real character?”</p>\n<p>“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly</p>\n<p>did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad</p>\n<p>affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:</p>",
        "<p>but I hope this may be false.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,</p>\n<p>this could not have happened!”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.</p>\n<p>“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what</p>\n<p>their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”</p>\n<p>“We acted with the best intentions.”</p>",
        "<p>“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his</p>\n<p>wife?”</p>\n<p>“He brought it with him for us to see.”</p>\n<p>Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These</p>\n<p>were the contents:--</p>\n<p>/* NIND “My dear Harriet, */</p>\n<p>“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help</p>",
        "<p>laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am</p>\n<p>missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with</p>\n<p>who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the</p>\n<p>world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without</p>\n<p>him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at</p>\n<p>Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the</p>\n<p>surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia</p>",
        "<p>Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for</p>\n<p>laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my</p>\n<p>engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will</p>\n<p>excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at</p>\n<p>the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my</p>\n<p>clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to</p>\n<p>mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed</p>",
        "<p>up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will</p>\n<p>drink to our good journey.</p>\n<p>“Your affectionate friend,</p>\n<p>“LYDIA BENNET.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had</p>\n<p>finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But</p>\n<p>at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.</p>",
        "<p>Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a</p>\n<p>_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”</p>\n<p>“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten</p>\n<p>minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in</p>\n<p>such confusion!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who</p>\n<p>did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”</p>",
        "<p>“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is</p>\n<p>very difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to</p>\n<p>give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much</p>\n<p>as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen</p>\n<p>almost took from me my faculties.”</p>\n<p>“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look</p>\n<p>well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety</p>",
        "<p>upon yourself alone.”</p>\n<p>“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every</p>\n<p>fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.</p>\n<p>Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of</p>\n<p>repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on</p>\n<p>Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till</p>\n<p>Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady</p>",
        "<p>Lucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to</p>\n<p>condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if</p>\n<p>they could be of use to us.”</p>\n<p>“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she</p>\n<p>_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too</p>\n<p>little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,</p>\n<p>insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”</p>",
        "<p>She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had</p>\n<p>intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.</p>\n<p>“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where</p>\n<p>they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could</p>\n<p>be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the</p>\n<p>number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come</p>\n<p>with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a</p>",
        "<p>gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be</p>\n<p>remarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow</p>\n<p>discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he</p>\n<p>determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible</p>\n<p>to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any</p>\n<p>other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,</p>\n<p>and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding</p>",
        "<p>out even so much as this.”</p>\n<p>The Post</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h3>\n<p>The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next</p>\n<p>morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.</p>\n<p>His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and</p>\n<p>dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.</p>\n<p>They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to</p>\n<p>send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.</p>\n<p>When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant</p>\n<p>information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,</p>\n<p>to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to</p>\n<p>the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only</p>\n<p>security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few</p>",
        "<p>days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to</p>\n<p>her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a</p>\n<p>great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also</p>\n<p>visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of</p>\n<p>cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without</p>\n<p>reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,</p>\n<p>she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found</p>",
        "<p>them.</p>\n<p>All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months</p>\n<p>before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt</p>\n<p>to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with</p>\n<p>the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.</p>\n<p>Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and</p>\n<p>everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the</p>",
        "<p>appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above</p>\n<p>half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of</p>\n<p>her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still</p>\n<p>less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now</p>\n<p>come, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before</p>\n<p>entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some</p>\n<p>news of them.</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a</p>\n<p>letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately</p>\n<p>found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.</p>\n<p>That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but</p>\n<p>without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now</p>\n<p>determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet</p>\n<p>thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first</p>",
        "<p>coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself</p>\n<p>did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was</p>\n<p>eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.</p>\n<p>Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and</p>\n<p>promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this</p>\n<p>effect:--</p>\n<p>“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if</p>",
        "<p>possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,</p>\n<p>whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to</p>\n<p>know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there</p>\n<p>were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such</p>\n<p>a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have</p>\n<p>nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in</p>\n<p>his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps</p>",
        "<p>Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any</p>\n<p>other person.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for</p>\n<p>her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any</p>\n<p>information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.</p>\n<p>She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father</p>\n<p>and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,</p>",
        "<p>however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to</p>\n<p>give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting</p>\n<p>it, the application was a something to look forward to.</p>\n<p>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious</p>\n<p>part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was</p>\n<p>the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,</p>\n<p>whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every</p>",
        "<p>succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.</p>\n<p>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for</p>\n<p>their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane</p>\n<p>had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,</p>\n<p>she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his</p>\n<p>letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as</p>\n<p>follows:--</p>",
        "<p>/* “My dear Sir, */</p>\n<p>“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation</p>\n<p>in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now</p>\n<p>suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter</p>\n<p>from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and</p>\n<p>myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable</p>\n<p>family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest</p>",
        "<p>kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No</p>\n<p>arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe</p>\n<p>a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that</p>\n<p>must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The</p>\n<p>death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of</p>\n<p>this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to</p>\n<p>suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness</p>",
        "<p>of behaviour in your</p>\n<p>“To whom I have related the affair”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,</p>\n<p>at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,</p>\n<p>I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally</p>\n<p>bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an</p>",
        "<p>age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in</p>\n<p>which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.</p>\n<p>They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one</p>\n<p>daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for</p>\n<p>who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect</p>\n<p>themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,</p>",
        "<p>moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain</p>\n<p>event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been</p>\n<p>involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,</p>\n<p>my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off</p>\n<p>your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to</p>\n<p>reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.</p>\n<p>“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from</p>\n<p>Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.</p>\n<p>It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up</p>\n<p>any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His</p>\n<p>former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the</p>\n<p>militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship</p>\n<p>with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out</p>",
        "<p>as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own</p>\n<p>finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to</p>\n<p>his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired</p>\n<p>that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.</p>\n<p>Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be</p>\n<p>necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the</p>\n<p>town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner</p>",
        "<p>did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;</p>\n<p>Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly</p>\n<p>unexpected; I had not an idea of it.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their</p>\n<p>father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered</p>\n<p>spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to</p>\n<p>his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and</p>",
        "<p>leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable</p>\n<p>for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did</p>\n<p>not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering</p>\n<p>what her anxiety for his life had been before.</p>\n<p>“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he</p>\n<p>will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,</p>\n<p>and make him marry her, if he comes away?”</p>",
        "<p>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she</p>\n<p>and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet</p>\n<p>came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their</p>\n<p>journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her</p>\n<p>Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.</p>\n<p>His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;</p>",
        "<p>and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of</p>\n<p>their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from</p>\n<p>Pemberley.</p>\n<p>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for</p>\n<p>the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be</p>\n<p>fairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time</p>",
        "<p>tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware</p>\n<p>that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of</p>\n<p>Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,</p>\n<p>one sleepless night out of two.</p>\n<p>When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual</p>\n<p>philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the</p>\n<p>habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him</p>",
        "<p>away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that</p>\n<p>Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly</p>\n<p>expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say</p>\n<p>nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,</p>\n<p>and I ought to feel it.”</p>",
        "<p>“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to</p>\n<p>fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have</p>\n<p>been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.</p>\n<p>It will pass away soon enough.”</p>\n<p>“Do you suppose them to be in London?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”</p>",
        "<p>“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.</p>\n<p>“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there</p>\n<p>will probably be of some duration.”</p>\n<p>Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no</p>\n<p>ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,</p>\n<p>considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”</p>\n<p>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s</p>",
        "<p>tea.</p>\n<p>“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an</p>\n<p>elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my</p>\n<p>library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as</p>\n<p>I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”</p>\n<p>“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_</p>\n<p>should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”</p>",
        "<p>“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,</p>\n<p>for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and</p>\n<p>you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house</p>\n<p>again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely</p>\n<p>prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are</p>\n<p>never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten</p>\n<p>minutes of every day in a rational manner.”</p>",
        "<p>Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.</p>\n<p>“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good</p>\n<p>girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of</p>\n<p>them.”</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XLIX.</h3>\n<p>Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking</p>\n<p>together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper</p>\n<p>coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their</p>\n<p>mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,</p>\n<p>when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,</p>\n<p>madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some</p>",
        "<p>good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”</p>\n<p>“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know</p>\n<p>there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here</p>\n<p>this half hour, and master has had a letter.”</p>\n<p>Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They</p>\n<p>ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the</p>",
        "<p>library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of</p>\n<p>seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the</p>\n<p>butler, who said,--</p>\n<p>“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the</p>\n<p>little copse.”</p>\n<p>Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,</p>\n<p>and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately</p>",
        "<p>pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.</p>\n<p>Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,</p>\n<p>came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--</p>\n<p>“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”</p>\n<p>“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”</p>",
        "<p>“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from</p>\n<p>his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.</p>\n<p>“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is</p>\n<p>about.”</p>\n<p>/* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */</p>\n<p>“My dear Brother,</p>",
        "<p>“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such</p>\n<p>as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after</p>\n<p>you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what</p>\n<p>part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.</p>\n<p>It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them</p>\n<p>both----”</p>\n<p>“But perhaps you would like to read it”</p>",
        "<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,</p>\n<p>nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are</p>\n<p>willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on</p>\n<p>your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is</p>\n<p>required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her</p>",
        "<p>equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your</p>\n<p>children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,</p>\n<p>moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your</p>\n<p>life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,</p>\n<p>considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as</p>\n<p>far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by</p>\n<p>express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You</p>",
        "<p>will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s</p>\n<p>circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to</p>\n<p>be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to</p>\n<p>say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are</p>\n<p>discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.</p>\n<p>If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act</p>\n<p>in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will</p>",
        "<p>immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper</p>\n<p>settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming</p>\n<p>to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on</p>\n<p>my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,</p>\n<p>and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my</p>\n<p>niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will</p>\n<p>approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as</p>",
        "<p>anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.</p>\n<p>“EDW. GARDINER.”</p>\n<p>“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be</p>\n<p>possible that he will marry her?”</p>\n<p>“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her</p>\n<p>sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”</p>\n<p>“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.</p>",
        "<p>“No; but it must be done soon.”</p>\n<p>Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he</p>\n<p>wrote.</p>\n<p>“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.</p>\n<p>Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”</p>\n<p>“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble</p>\n<p>yourself.”</p>",
        "<p>“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”</p>\n<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.</p>\n<p>“And--may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be</p>\n<p>complied with.”</p>\n<p>“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”</p>\n<p>“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there</p>",
        "<p>are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money</p>\n<p>your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever</p>\n<p>to pay him.”</p>\n<p>“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”</p>\n<p>“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight</p>\n<p>a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am</p>\n<p>gone.”</p>",
        "<p>“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me</p>\n<p>before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,</p>\n<p>it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has</p>\n<p>distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”</p>\n<p>“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing</p>\n<p>less than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,</p>\n<p>in the very beginning of our relationship.”</p>",
        "<p>“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be</p>\n<p>repaid?”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued</p>\n<p>silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the</p>\n<p>library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.</p>\n<p>“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they</p>\n<p>were by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be</p>",
        "<p>thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,</p>\n<p>and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”</p>\n<p>“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would</p>\n<p>not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind</p>\n<p>uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten</p>\n<p>thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children</p>\n<p>of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand</p>",
        "<p>pounds?”</p>\n<p>“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall</p>\n<p>exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has</p>\n<p>not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be</p>\n<p>requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal</p>\n<p>protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as</p>",
        "<p>years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is</p>\n<p>actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,</p>\n<p>she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she</p>\n<p>first sees my aunt!”</p>\n<p>“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said</p>\n<p>Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry</p>\n<p>her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of</p>",
        "<p>thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself</p>\n<p>they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in</p>\n<p>time make their past imprudence forgotten.”</p>\n<p>“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor</p>\n<p>I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”</p>\n<p>It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood</p>\n<p>perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,</p>",
        "<p>therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make</p>\n<p>it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly</p>\n<p>replied,--</p>\n<p>“Just as you please.”</p>\n<p>“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”</p>\n<p>“Take whatever you like, and get away.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs</p>",
        "<p>together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication</p>\n<p>would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,</p>\n<p>the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As</p>\n<p>soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,</p>\n<p>her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its</p>\n<p>exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she</p>\n<p>had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter</p>",
        "<p>would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her</p>\n<p>felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.</p>\n<p>“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will</p>\n<p>be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My</p>\n<p>good, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage</p>\n<p>everything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the</p>\n<p>clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about</p>",
        "<p>them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how</p>\n<p>much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,</p>\n<p>Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear</p>\n<p>Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”</p>\n<p>Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of</p>\n<p>these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.</p>\n<p>Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.</p>",
        "<p>“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great</p>\n<p>measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to</p>\n<p>assist Mr. Wickham with money.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but</p>\n<p>her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children</p>\n<p>must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have</p>\n<p>ever had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.</p>",
        "<p>In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well</p>\n<p>it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in</p>\n<p>such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you</p>\n<p>write for me. We will settle with your father about the money</p>\n<p>afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”</p>\n<p>She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and</p>\n<p>cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had</p>",
        "<p>not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her</p>\n<p>father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,</p>\n<p>would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite</p>\n<p>so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.</p>\n<p>“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the</p>\n<p>good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on</p>\n<p>Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An</p>",
        "<p>airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do</p>\n<p>anything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you</p>\n<p>heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall</p>\n<p>all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her</p>\n<p>congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took</p>\n<p>refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s</p>",
        "<p>situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she</p>\n<p>had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,</p>\n<p>neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly</p>\n<p>expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only</p>\n<p>two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.</p>\n<p>“The spiteful old ladies”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER L.</h3>\n<p>Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,</p>\n<p>instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for</p>\n<p>the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived</p>\n<p>him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that</p>\n<p>respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of</p>\n<p>honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of</p>",
        "<p>prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to</p>\n<p>be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.</p>\n<p>He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone</p>\n<p>should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he</p>\n<p>was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,</p>\n<p>and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.</p>\n<p>When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly</p>",
        "<p>useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join</p>\n<p>in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow</p>\n<p>and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters</p>\n<p>successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he</p>\n<p>would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too</p>\n<p>late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her</p>",
        "<p>husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their</p>\n<p>income.</p>\n<p>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and</p>\n<p>the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the</p>\n<p>latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with</p>\n<p>regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet</p>\n<p>could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In</p>",
        "<p>terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though</p>\n<p>expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect</p>\n<p>approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the</p>\n<p>engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed</p>\n<p>that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be</p>\n<p>done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present</p>\n<p>arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the</p>",
        "<p>hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket</p>\n<p>allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her</p>\n<p>through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within</p>\n<p>that sum.</p>\n<p>That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was</p>\n<p>another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have</p>\n<p>as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports</p>",
        "<p>of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he</p>\n<p>naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon</p>\n<p>despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in</p>\n<p>its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was</p>\n<p>indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any</p>\n<p>message to her.</p>\n<p>The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate</p>",
        "<p>speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent</p>\n<p>philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of</p>\n<p>conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the</p>\n<p>happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant</p>\n<p>farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the</p>\n<p>good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from</p>\n<p>all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit</p>",
        "<p>in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery</p>\n<p>was considered certain.</p>\n<p>It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this</p>\n<p>happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in</p>\n<p>spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her</p>\n<p>triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of</p>\n<p>her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of</p>",
        "<p>accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those</p>\n<p>attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and</p>\n<p>servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a</p>\n<p>proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering</p>\n<p>what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and</p>\n<p>importance.</p>\n<p>“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the</p>",
        "<p>great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is</p>\n<p>too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for</p>\n<p>Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”</p>\n<p>Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the</p>\n<p>servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and</p>\n<p>daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this</p>",
        "<p>neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the</p>\n<p>imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”</p>\n<p>A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it</p>\n<p>soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,</p>\n<p>that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his</p>\n<p>daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of</p>\n<p>affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend</p>",
        "<p>it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable</p>\n<p>resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her</p>\n<p>marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe</p>\n<p>possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new</p>\n<p>clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of</p>\n<p>shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they</p>\n<p>took place.</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of</p>\n<p>the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for</p>\n<p>her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper</p>\n<p>termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its</p>\n<p>unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the</p>\n<p>spot.</p>\n<p>She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were</p>",
        "<p>few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;</p>\n<p>but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s</p>\n<p>frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of</p>\n<p>disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there</p>\n<p>seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been</p>\n<p>concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other</p>",
        "<p>objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest</p>\n<p>kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.</p>\n<p>From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The</p>\n<p>wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his</p>\n<p>feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a</p>\n<p>blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she</p>\n<p>hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no</p>",
        "<p>longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there</p>\n<p>seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that</p>\n<p>she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they</p>\n<p>should meet.</p>\n<p>What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the</p>\n<p>proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now</p>\n<p>have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she</p>",
        "<p>doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,</p>\n<p>there must be a triumph.</p>\n<p>She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in</p>\n<p>disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and</p>\n<p>temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It</p>\n<p>was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease</p>\n<p>and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;</p>",
        "<p>and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must</p>\n<p>have received benefit of greater importance.</p>\n<p>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what</p>\n<p>connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and</p>\n<p>precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their</p>\n<p>family.</p>\n<p>How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she</p>",
        "<p>could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to</p>\n<p>a couple who were only brought together because their passions were</p>\n<p>stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s</p>\n<p>acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to</p>\n<p>promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties</p>\n<p>that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal</p>",
        "<p>purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved</p>\n<p>on quitting the militia.</p>\n<p>“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his</p>\n<p>marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in</p>\n<p>considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his</p>\n<p>account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the</p>\n<p>Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are</p>",
        "<p>able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an</p>\n<p>ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is</p>\n<p>an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He</p>\n<p>promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each</p>\n<p>have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have</p>\n<p>written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,</p>\n<p>and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham</p>",
        "<p>in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have</p>\n<p>pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying</p>\n<p>similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin</p>\n<p>a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I</p>\n<p>hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and</p>\n<p>all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,</p>\n<p>unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she</p>\n<p>leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to</p>\n<p>you and her mother.--Yours, etc.</p>\n<p>“E. GARDINER.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s</p>\n<p>removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in</p>",
        "<p>the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her</p>\n<p>company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in</p>\n<p>Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a</p>\n<p>pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted</p>\n<p>with everybody, and had so many favourites.</p>\n<p>“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking</p>\n<p>to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she</p>",
        "<p>likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s</p>\n<p>regiment.”</p>\n<p>His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being</p>\n<p>admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,</p>\n<p>received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who</p>\n<p>agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and</p>\n<p>consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,</p>",
        "<p>urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her</p>\n<p>and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was</p>\n<p>prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their</p>\n<p>mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show</p>\n<p>her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to</p>\n<p>the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he</p>\n<p>sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon</p>",
        "<p>as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth</p>\n<p>was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;</p>\n<p>and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him</p>\n<p>would have been the last object of her wishes.</p>\n<p>“With an affectionate smile”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LI.</h3>\n<p>Their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her</p>\n<p>probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet</p>\n<p>them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival</p>\n<p>was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who</p>\n<p>gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_</p>\n<p>been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister</p>",
        "<p>must endure.</p>\n<p>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive</p>\n<p>them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to</p>\n<p>the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,</p>\n<p>anxious, uneasy.</p>\n<p>Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and</p>\n<p>she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and</p>",
        "<p>welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to</p>\n<p>Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an</p>\n<p>alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.</p>\n<p>Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite</p>\n<p>so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely</p>\n<p>opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was</p>\n<p>enough to provoke him.</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was</p>\n<p>Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned</p>\n<p>from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at</p>\n<p>length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of</p>\n<p>some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a</p>\n<p>great while since she had been there.</p>\n<p>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners</p>",
        "<p>were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been</p>\n<p>exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he</p>\n<p>claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth</p>\n<p>had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat</p>\n<p>down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the</p>\n<p>impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the</p>\n<p>cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of</p>",
        "<p>colour.</p>\n<p>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither</p>\n<p>of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,</p>\n<p>with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her</p>\n<p>replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the</p>\n<p>world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led</p>",
        "<p>voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for</p>\n<p>the world.</p>\n<p>“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:</p>\n<p>it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things</p>\n<p>enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure</p>\n<p>I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I</p>\n<p>thought it would be very good fun if I was.”</p>",
        "<p>Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked</p>\n<p>expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of</p>\n<p>which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--</p>\n<p>“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was</p>\n<p>afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,</p>\n<p>so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass</p>\n<p>next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the</p>",
        "<p>window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and</p>\n<p>smiled like anything.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;</p>\n<p>and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to</p>\n<p>the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with</p>\n<p>anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to</p>\n<p>her eldest sister,--</p>",
        "<p>“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a</p>\n<p>married woman.”</p>\n<p>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment</p>\n<p>from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good</p>\n<p>spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all</p>\n<p>their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by</p>\n<p>each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring</p>",
        "<p>and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.</p>\n<p>“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the</p>\n<p>breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a</p>\n<p>charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they</p>\n<p>may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the</p>\n<p>place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”</p>\n<p>“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t</p>",
        "<p>at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.</p>\n<p>You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at</p>\n<p>Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I</p>\n<p>will take care to get good partners for them all.”</p>\n<p>“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.</p>\n<p>“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters</p>",
        "<p>behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the</p>\n<p>winter is over.”</p>\n<p>“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not</p>\n<p>particularly like your way of getting husbands.”</p>\n<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham</p>\n<p>had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join</p>\n<p>his regiment at the end of a fortnight.</p>",
        "<p>No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and</p>\n<p>she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and</p>\n<p>having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to</p>\n<p>all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did</p>\n<p>think than such as did not.</p>\n<p>Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to</p>\n<p>find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her</p>",
        "<p>present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that</p>\n<p>their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather</p>\n<p>than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring</p>\n<p>for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain</p>\n<p>that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and</p>\n<p>if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity</p>\n<p>of having a companion.</p>",
        "<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every</p>\n<p>occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did</p>\n<p>everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds</p>\n<p>on the first of September than anybody else in the country.</p>\n<p>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two</p>\n<p>elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--</p>\n<p>“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were</p>",
        "<p>not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you</p>\n<p>curious to hear how it was managed?”</p>\n<p>“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little</p>\n<p>said on the subject.”</p>\n<p>“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were</p>\n<p>married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in</p>\n<p>that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven</p>",
        "<p>o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others</p>\n<p>were to meet us at the church.</p>\n<p>“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,</p>\n<p>you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should</p>\n<p>have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was</p>\n<p>dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a</p>\n<p>sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was</p>",
        "<p>thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether</p>\n<p>he would be married in his blue coat.</p>\n<p>“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never</p>\n<p>be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt</p>\n<p>were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe</p>\n<p>me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a</p>\n<p>fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was</p>",
        "<p>rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.</p>\n<p>“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was</p>\n<p>called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you</p>\n<p>know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so</p>\n<p>frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;</p>\n<p>and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,</p>\n<p>luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set</p>",
        "<p>out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented</p>\n<p>going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as</p>\n<p>well.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!</p>\n<p>I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised</p>\n<p>them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”</p>",
        "<p>“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the</p>\n<p>subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will</p>\n<p>ask you no questions.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you</p>\n<p>all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”</p>\n<p>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her</p>",
        "<p>power, by running away.</p>\n<p>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it</p>\n<p>was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her</p>\n<p>sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,</p>\n<p>where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.</p>\n<p>Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her</p>\n<p>brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as</p>",
        "<p>placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She</p>\n<p>could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,</p>\n<p>wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what</p>\n<p>Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been</p>\n<p>intended.</p>\n<p>“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to</p>\n<p>know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively</p>",
        "<p>speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such</p>\n<p>a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,</p>\n<p>for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to</p>\n<p>think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with</p>\n<p>ignorance.”</p>\n<p>“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the</p>\n<p>letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable</p>",
        "<p>manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it</p>\n<p>out.”</p>\n<p>Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to</p>\n<p>Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of</p>\n<p>it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any</p>\n<p>satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.</p>\n<p>“I am sure she did not listen.”</p>",
        "<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LII.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as</p>\n<p>soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than</p>\n<p>hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be</p>\n<p>interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be</p>\n<p>happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not</p>\n<p>contain a denial.</p>",
        "<p>/* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */</p>\n<p>“My dear Niece,</p>\n<p>“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole</p>\n<p>morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will</p>\n<p>not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself</p>\n<p>surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.</p>\n<p>Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,</p>",
        "<p>that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_</p>\n<p>side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my</p>\n<p>impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing</p>\n<p>but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed</p>\n<p>him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and</p>\n<p>ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming</p>\n<p>home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.</p>",
        "<p>Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all</p>\n<p>over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked</p>\n<p>as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he</p>\n<p>had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he</p>\n<p>had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.</p>\n<p>From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after</p>\n<p>ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for</p>",
        "<p>them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to</p>\n<p>himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as</p>\n<p>to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or</p>\n<p>confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken</p>\n<p>pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to</p>\n<p>lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to</p>\n<p>speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step</p>",
        "<p>forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on</p>\n<p>by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never</p>\n<p>disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to</p>\n<p>discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was</p>\n<p>more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another</p>\n<p>reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a</p>\n<p>Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was</p>",
        "<p>dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though</p>\n<p>he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,</p>\n<p>and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.</p>\n<p>Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he</p>\n<p>went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But</p>\n<p>it was two or three days before he could get from her what he</p>\n<p>wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery</p>",
        "<p>and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be</p>\n<p>found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in</p>\n<p>London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they</p>\n<p>would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our</p>\n<p>kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----</p>\n<p>Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.</p>\n<p>His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade</p>",
        "<p>her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her</p>\n<p>friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,</p>\n<p>offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia</p>\n<p>absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none</p>\n<p>of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of</p>\n<p>leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or</p>\n<p>other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her</p>",
        "<p>feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a</p>\n<p>marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he</p>\n<p>easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself</p>\n<p>obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour</p>\n<p>which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill</p>\n<p>consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to</p>\n<p>resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,</p>",
        "<p>he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but</p>\n<p>he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live</p>\n<p>on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.</p>\n<p>Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have</p>\n<p>been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been</p>\n<p>benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,</p>\n<p>that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making</p>",
        "<p>his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such</p>\n<p>circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the</p>\n<p>temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there</p>\n<p>was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he</p>\n<p>could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything</p>\n<p>being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make</p>\n<p>your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch</p>",
        "<p>Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not</p>\n<p>be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father</p>\n<p>was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did</p>\n<p>not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly</p>\n<p>consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him</p>\n<p>till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,</p>\n<p>and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called</p>",
        "<p>on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your</p>\n<p>uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk</p>\n<p>together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It</p>\n<p>was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express</p>\n<p>was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I</p>\n<p>fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,</p>\n<p>after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;</p>",
        "<p>but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not</p>\n<p>do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,</p>\n<p>therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have</p>\n<p>settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which</p>\n<p>was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it</p>\n<p>deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead</p>\n<p>of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up</p>",
        "<p>with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely</p>\n<p>against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning</p>\n<p>gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that</p>\n<p>would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where</p>\n<p>it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or</p>\n<p>Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done</p>\n<p>for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I</p>",
        "<p>believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another</p>\n<p>thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his</p>\n<p>commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him</p>\n<p>alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his</p>\n<p>reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character</p>\n<p>had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been</p>\n<p>received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in</p>",
        "<p>_this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_</p>\n<p>reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this</p>\n<p>fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that</p>\n<p>your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit</p>\n<p>for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved</p>\n<p>on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at</p>\n<p>Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more</p>",
        "<p>when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to</p>\n<p>receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.</p>\n<p>It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I</p>\n<p>hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to</p>\n<p>us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was</p>\n<p>exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I</p>\n<p>would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour</p>",
        "<p>while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter</p>\n<p>last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a</p>\n<p>piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no</p>\n<p>fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,</p>\n<p>representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all</p>\n<p>the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it</p>\n<p>was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes</p>",
        "<p>quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,</p>\n<p>and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual</p>\n<p>in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He</p>\n<p>dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on</p>\n<p>Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear</p>\n<p>Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold</p>\n<p>enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,</p>",
        "<p>in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.</p>\n<p>His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but</p>\n<p>a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his</p>\n<p>wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever</p>\n<p>mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive</p>\n<p>me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so</p>\n<p>far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I</p>",
        "<p>have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair</p>\n<p>of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The</p>\n<p>children have been wanting me this half hour.</p>\n<p>“Yours, very sincerely,</p>\n<p>“M. GARDINER.”</p>\n<p>The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,</p>\n<p>in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the</p>",
        "<p>greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had</p>\n<p>produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her</p>\n<p>sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of</p>\n<p>goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be</p>\n<p>just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest</p>\n<p>extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken</p>\n<p>on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a</p>",
        "<p>research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he</p>\n<p>must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently</p>\n<p>meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always</p>\n<p>most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to</p>\n<p>pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard</p>\n<p>nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it</p>\n<p>was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt</p>",
        "<p>that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his</p>\n<p>affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to</p>\n<p>overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with</p>\n<p>Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from</p>\n<p>the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think</p>\n<p>how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no</p>\n<p>extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel</p>",
        "<p>he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising</p>\n<p>it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,</p>\n<p>she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might</p>\n<p>assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be</p>\n<p>materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that</p>\n<p>they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a</p>\n<p>return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to</p>",
        "<p>him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she</p>\n<p>had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards</p>\n<p>him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that</p>\n<p>in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better</p>\n<p>of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and</p>\n<p>again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible</p>\n<p>of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly</p>",
        "<p>both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence</p>\n<p>subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.</p>\n<p>She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;</p>\n<p>and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by</p>\n<p>Wickham.</p>\n<p>“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,</p>\n<p>as he joined her.</p>",
        "<p>“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow</p>\n<p>that the interruption must be unwelcome.”</p>\n<p>“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,</p>\n<p>and now we are better.”</p>\n<p>“True. Are the others coming out?”</p>\n<p>“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to</p>\n<p>Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that</p>",
        "<p>you have actually seen Pemberley.”</p>\n<p>She replied in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much</p>\n<p>for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the</p>\n<p>old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of</p>\n<p>me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, she did.”</p>",
        "<p>“And what did she say?”</p>\n<p>“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned</p>\n<p>out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely</p>\n<p>misrepresented.”</p>\n<p>“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had</p>\n<p>silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other</p>",
        "<p>several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said</p>\n<p>Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this</p>\n<p>time of year.”</p>\n<p>“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I</p>\n<p>understood from the Gardiners that you had.”</p>\n<p>“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”</p>",
        "<p>“And do you like her?”</p>\n<p>“Very much.”</p>\n<p>“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year</p>\n<p>or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad</p>\n<p>you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”</p>\n<p>“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”</p>\n<p>“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”</p>",
        "<p>“I do not recollect that we did.”</p>\n<p>“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most</p>\n<p>delightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in</p>\n<p>every respect.”</p>\n<p>“How should you have liked making sermons?”</p>\n<p>“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and</p>\n<p>the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,</p>",
        "<p>to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the</p>\n<p>retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of</p>\n<p>happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the</p>\n<p>circumstance when you were in Kent?”</p>\n<p>“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was</p>\n<p>left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”</p>\n<p>“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the</p>",
        "<p>first, you may remember.”</p>\n<p>“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so</p>\n<p>palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually</p>\n<p>declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business</p>\n<p>had been compromised accordingly.”</p>\n<p>“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember</p>\n<p>what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”</p>",
        "<p>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast</p>\n<p>to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,</p>\n<p>she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--</p>\n<p>“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us</p>\n<p>quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one</p>\n<p>mind.”</p>\n<p>She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though</p>",
        "<p>he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Darcy with him.”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LIII.</h3>\n<p>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he</p>\n<p>never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she</p>\n<p>had said enough to keep him quiet.</p>\n<p>The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was</p>\n<p>forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means</p>",
        "<p>entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to</p>\n<p>continue at least a twelvemonth.</p>\n<p>“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”</p>\n<p>“Write to me very often, my dear.”</p>\n<p>“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for</p>\n<p>writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to</p>",
        "<p>do.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He</p>\n<p>smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.</p>\n<p>“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of</p>\n<p>the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us</p>\n<p>all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas</p>\n<p>himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”</p>",
        "<p>The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.</p>\n<p>“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with</p>\n<p>one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”</p>\n<p>“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said</p>\n<p>Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are</p>\n<p>single.”</p>\n<p>“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;</p>",
        "<p>but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If</p>\n<p>that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”</p>\n<p>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly</p>\n<p>relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an</p>\n<p>article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper</p>\n<p>at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her</p>\n<p>master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several</p>",
        "<p>weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and</p>\n<p>smiled, and shook her head, by turns.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.</p>\n<p>Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that</p>\n<p>I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I</p>\n<p>never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to</p>\n<p>Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that</p>",
        "<p>is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention</p>\n<p>a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”</p>\n<p>“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in</p>\n<p>Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose</p>\n<p>to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He</p>\n<p>comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was</p>\n<p>going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on</p>",
        "<p>Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”</p>\n<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing</p>\n<p>colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to</p>\n<p>Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--</p>\n<p>“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present</p>\n<p>report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from</p>\n<p>any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that</p>",
        "<p>I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect</p>\n<p>me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes</p>\n<p>alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of</p>\n<p>_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in</p>\n<p>Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no</p>\n<p>other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial</p>",
        "<p>to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming</p>\n<p>there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come</p>\n<p>without it.</p>\n<p>“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come</p>\n<p>to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this</p>\n<p>speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”</p>\n<p>In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her</p>",
        "<p>feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily</p>\n<p>perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,</p>\n<p>more unequal, than she had often seen them.</p>\n<p>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,</p>\n<p>about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.</p>\n<p>“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you</p>\n<p>will wait on him, of course.”</p>",
        "<p>“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I</p>\n<p>went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in</p>\n<p>nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”</p>\n<p>His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention</p>\n<p>would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to</p>\n<p>Netherfield.</p>\n<p>“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let</p>",
        "<p>him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in</p>\n<p>running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back</p>\n<p>again.”</p>\n<p>“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait</p>\n<p>on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I</p>\n<p>am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will</p>\n<p>make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for</p>",
        "<p>him.”</p>\n<p>Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her</p>\n<p>husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her</p>\n<p>neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before</p>\n<p>_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--</p>\n<p>“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It</p>\n<p>would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can</p>",
        "<p>hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;</p>\n<p>but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she</p>\n<p>says. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”</p>\n<p>“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it</p>\n<p>is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction</p>\n<p>of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have</p>\n<p>always so much.”</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,</p>\n<p>contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety</p>\n<p>and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days</p>\n<p>that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of</p>\n<p>seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in</p>\n<p>Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the</p>\n<p>paddock, and ride towards the house.</p>",
        "<p>Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely</p>\n<p>kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went</p>\n<p>to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down</p>\n<p>again by her sister.</p>\n<p>“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”</p>\n<p>“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not</p>\n<p>know.”</p>",
        "<p>“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with</p>\n<p>him before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”</p>\n<p>“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of</p>\n<p>Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must</p>\n<p>say that I hate the very sight of him.”</p>\n<p>Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little</p>\n<p>of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness</p>",
        "<p>which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time</p>\n<p>after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable</p>\n<p>enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their</p>\n<p>mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be</p>\n<p>civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either</p>\n<p>of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be</p>\n<p>suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards</p>\n<p>him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,</p>\n<p>and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive</p>\n<p>information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted</p>\n<p>for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an</p>\n<p>interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as</p>\n<p>what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his</p>",
        "<p>coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,</p>\n<p>was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered</p>\n<p>behaviour in Derbyshire.</p>\n<p>The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a</p>\n<p>minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to</p>\n<p>her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and</p>\n<p>wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.</p>",
        "<p>“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early</p>\n<p>enough for expectation.”</p>\n<p>She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to</p>\n<p>lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her</p>\n<p>sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little</p>\n<p>paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the</p>\n<p>gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with</p>",
        "<p>tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any</p>\n<p>symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down</p>\n<p>again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She</p>\n<p>had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,</p>\n<p>she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as</p>\n<p>she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her</p>",
        "<p>mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a</p>\n<p>painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.</p>\n<p>Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period</p>\n<p>saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,</p>\n<p>especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of</p>\n<p>her courtesy and address of his friend.</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the</p>\n<p>preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was</p>\n<p>hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill</p>\n<p>applied.</p>\n<p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question</p>\n<p>which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He</p>\n<p>was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but</p>",
        "<p>it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends</p>\n<p>when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without</p>\n<p>bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist</p>\n<p>the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often</p>\n<p>found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but</p>\n<p>the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when</p>\n<p>they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry</p>",
        "<p>with herself for being so.</p>\n<p>“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”</p>\n<p>She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to</p>\n<p>him she had hardly courage to speak.</p>\n<p>She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.</p>\n<p>“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.</p>\n<p>He readily agreed to it.</p>",
        "<p>“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,</p>\n<p>you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope</p>\n<p>it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood</p>\n<p>since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my</p>\n<p>own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have</p>\n<p>seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;</p>\n<p>though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,</p>",
        "<p>George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a</p>\n<p>syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.</p>\n<p>It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came</p>\n<p>to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”</p>\n<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth</p>\n<p>dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could</p>\n<p>not tell.</p>",
        "<p>“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”</p>\n<p>continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very</p>\n<p>hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a</p>\n<p>place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not</p>\n<p>know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of</p>\n<p>his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.</p>\n<p>Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he</p>",
        "<p>deserves.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery</p>\n<p>of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,</p>\n<p>the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done</p>\n<p>before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the</p>\n<p>country at present. A few weeks, he believed.</p>\n<p>“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,</p>",
        "<p>“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.</p>\n<p>Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and</p>\n<p>will save all the best of the coveys for you.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious</p>\n<p>attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had</p>\n<p>flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be</p>\n<p>hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,</p>",
        "<p>that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for</p>\n<p>moments of such painful confusion.</p>\n<p>“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be</p>\n<p>in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure</p>\n<p>that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either</p>\n<p>one or the other again!”</p>\n<p>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no</p>",
        "<p>compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing</p>\n<p>how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former</p>\n<p>lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every</p>\n<p>five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her</p>\n<p>as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as</p>\n<p>unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no</p>\n<p>difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded</p>",
        "<p>that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,</p>\n<p>that she did not always know when she was silent.</p>\n<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her</p>\n<p>intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at</p>\n<p>Longbourn in a few days’ time.</p>\n<p>“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when</p>\n<p>you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with</p>",
        "<p>us as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you</p>\n<p>I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your</p>\n<p>engagement.”</p>\n<p>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of</p>\n<p>his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine</p>\n<p>there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did</p>",
        "<p>not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man</p>\n<p>on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride</p>\n<p>of one who had ten thousand a year.</p>\n<p>“Jane happened to look round”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LIV.</h3>\n<p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;</p>\n<p>or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects</p>\n<p>which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,</p>\n<p>“did he come at all?”</p>",
        "<p>She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.</p>\n<p>“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he</p>\n<p>was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he</p>\n<p>no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think</p>\n<p>no more about him.”</p>\n<p>Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach</p>\n<p>of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her</p>",
        "<p>better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly</p>\n<p>easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by</p>\n<p>his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly</p>\n<p>seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent</p>\n<p>acquaintance.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!</p>",
        "<p>take care.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”</p>\n<p>“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with</p>\n<p>you as ever.”</p>\n<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in</p>\n<p>the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the</p>\n<p>good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,</p>",
        "<p>had revived.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two</p>\n<p>who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as</p>\n<p>sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the</p>\n<p>dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take</p>\n<p>the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by</p>\n<p>her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to</p>",
        "<p>invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to</p>\n<p>hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was</p>\n<p>decided. He placed himself by her.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He</p>\n<p>bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that</p>\n<p>Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes</p>\n<p>likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing</p>",
        "<p>alarm.</p>\n<p>His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an</p>\n<p>admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his</p>\n<p>own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the</p>\n<p>consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It</p>\n<p>gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in</p>",
        "<p>no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table</p>\n<p>could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little</p>\n<p>such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to</p>\n<p>advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but</p>\n<p>she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and</p>\n<p>cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness</p>\n<p>made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;</p>",
        "<p>and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell</p>\n<p>him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of</p>\n<p>the family.</p>\n<p>She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of</p>\n<p>bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away</p>\n<p>without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,</p>\n<p>than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and</p>",
        "<p>uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen</p>\n<p>came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.</p>\n<p>She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her</p>\n<p>chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.</p>\n<p>“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for</p>\n<p>ever.”</p>\n<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have</p>",
        "<p>answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,</p>\n<p>where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,</p>\n<p>in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her</p>\n<p>which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of</p>\n<p>the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--</p>\n<p>“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;</p>\n<p>do we?”</p>",
        "<p>Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with</p>\n<p>her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough</p>\n<p>to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for</p>\n<p>being so silly!</p>\n<p>“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to</p>\n<p>expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not</p>\n<p>protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?</p>",
        "<p>There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”</p>\n<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup</p>\n<p>himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--</p>\n<p>“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”</p>\n<p>“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough</p>",
        "<p>these three weeks.”</p>\n<p>She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse</p>\n<p>with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for</p>\n<p>some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering</p>\n<p>to Elizabeth again, he walked away.</p>\n<p>When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies</p>\n<p>all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when</p>",
        "<p>all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her</p>\n<p>mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated</p>\n<p>with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.</p>\n<p>They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had</p>\n<p>nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side</p>\n<p>of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to</p>",
        "<p>supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the</p>\n<p>others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.</p>\n<p>“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what</p>\n<p>say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I</p>\n<p>assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The</p>\n<p>venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat</p>\n<p>a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the</p>",
        "<p>Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges</p>\n<p>were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French</p>\n<p>cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater</p>\n<p>beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And</p>\n<p>what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her</p>\n<p>at Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as</p>\n<p>good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved</p>",
        "<p>girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”</p>\n<p>“M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.”</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of</p>\n<p>Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at</p>\n<p>last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy</p>\n<p>humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at</p>",
        "<p>not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.</p>\n<p>“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The</p>\n<p>party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we</p>\n<p>may often meet again.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth smiled.</p>\n<p>“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I</p>\n<p>assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an</p>",
        "<p>agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am</p>\n<p>perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had</p>\n<p>any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with</p>\n<p>greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally</p>\n<p>pleasing, than any other man.”</p>\n<p>“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and</p>\n<p>are provoking me to it every moment.”</p>",
        "<p>“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in</p>\n<p>others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I</p>\n<p>acknowledge?”</p>\n<p>“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to</p>\n<p>instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive</p>\n<p>me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your</p>\n<p>confidante.”</p>",
        "<p>“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LV.</h3>\n<p>A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His</p>\n<p>friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in</p>\n<p>ten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably</p>\n<p>good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many</p>\n<p>expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.</p>\n<p>“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”</p>",
        "<p>He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she</p>\n<p>would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n<p>“Can you come to-morrow?”</p>\n<p>Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was</p>\n<p>accepted with alacrity.</p>\n<p>He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them</p>",
        "<p>dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her</p>\n<p>dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--</p>\n<p>“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is</p>\n<p>come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss</p>\n<p>Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss</p>\n<p>Lizzy’s hair.”</p>\n<p>“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is</p>",
        "<p>forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!</p>\n<p>where is your sash, my dear?”</p>\n<p>But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down</p>\n<p>without one of her sisters.</p>\n<p>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the</p>\n<p>evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his</p>",
        "<p>custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the</p>\n<p>five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at</p>\n<p>Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any</p>\n<p>impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last</p>\n<p>Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do</p>\n<p>you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still</p>",
        "<p>five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she</p>\n<p>suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--</p>\n<p>“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.</p>\n<p>Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such</p>\n<p>premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a</p>\n<p>few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--</p>\n<p>“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth was forced to go.</p>\n<p>“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as</p>\n<p>soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in</p>\n<p>my dressing-room.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained</p>\n<p>quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned</p>\n<p>into the drawing-room.</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was</p>\n<p>everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her</p>\n<p>daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable</p>\n<p>addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged</p>\n<p>officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a</p>\n<p>forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the</p>\n<p>daughter.</p>",
        "<p>He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away</p>\n<p>an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s</p>\n<p>means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.</p>\n<p>After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed</p>\n<p>between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the</p>\n<p>happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy</p>\n<p>returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably</p>",
        "<p>persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s</p>\n<p>concurrence.</p>\n<p>Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the</p>\n<p>morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more</p>\n<p>agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption</p>\n<p>or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into</p>\n<p>silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the</p>",
        "<p>other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;</p>\n<p>and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get</p>\n<p>everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to</p>\n<p>write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for</p>\n<p>as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be</p>\n<p>wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.</p>\n<p>But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,</p>",
        "<p>she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her</p>\n<p>mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she</p>\n<p>perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as</p>\n<p>if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,</p>\n<p>the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each</p>\n<p>other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but</p>\n<p>_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by</p>",
        "<p>either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when</p>\n<p>Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,</p>\n<p>whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</p>\n<p>Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give</p>\n<p>pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest</p>\n<p>emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.</p>\n<p>“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,</p>",
        "<p>why is not everybody as happy?”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a</p>\n<p>delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of</p>\n<p>kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not</p>\n<p>allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be</p>\n<p>said, for the present.</p>\n<p>“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any</p>",
        "<p>account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it</p>\n<p>from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to</p>\n<p>know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear</p>\n<p>family! how shall I bear so much happiness?”</p>\n<p>She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the</p>\n<p>card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease</p>",
        "<p>with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many</p>\n<p>previous months of suspense and vexation.</p>\n<p>“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious</p>\n<p>circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the</p>\n<p>happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”</p>\n<p>In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her</p>\n<p>father had been short and to the purpose.</p>",
        "<p>“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.</p>\n<p>“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”</p>\n<p>He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes</p>\n<p>and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her</p>\n<p>delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with</p>\n<p>great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen</p>\n<p>to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;</p>",
        "<p>and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his</p>\n<p>expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for</p>\n<p>basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of</p>\n<p>Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and</p>\n<p>himself.</p>\n<p>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of</p>\n<p>Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as</p>",
        "<p>made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped</p>\n<p>her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or</p>\n<p>speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,</p>\n<p>though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed</p>\n<p>how really happy he was.</p>\n<p>Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their</p>",
        "<p>visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he</p>\n<p>turned to his daughter and said,--</p>\n<p>“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”</p>\n<p>Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his</p>\n<p>goodness.</p>\n<p>“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in</p>\n<p>thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your</p>",
        "<p>doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are</p>\n<p>each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so</p>\n<p>easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will</p>\n<p>always exceed your income.”</p>\n<p>“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be</p>\n<p>unpardonable in _me_.”</p>\n<p>“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you</p>",
        "<p>talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely</p>\n<p>more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so</p>\n<p>happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it</p>\n<p>would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not</p>\n<p>be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when</p>\n<p>he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was</p>\n<p>that you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that</p>",
        "<p>ever was seen!”</p>\n<p>Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her</p>\n<p>favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger</p>\n<p>sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness</p>\n<p>which she might in future be able to dispense.</p>\n<p>Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty</p>\n<p>begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.</p>",
        "<p>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;</p>\n<p>coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after</p>\n<p>supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough</p>\n<p>detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought</p>\n<p>himself obliged to accept.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for</p>\n<p>while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but</p>",
        "<p>she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of</p>\n<p>separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always</p>\n<p>attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and</p>\n<p>when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.</p>\n<p>“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he</p>\n<p>was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed</p>\n<p>it possible.”</p>",
        "<p>“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for</p>\n<p>it?”</p>\n<p>“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to</p>\n<p>his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have</p>\n<p>chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,</p>\n<p>as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will</p>\n<p>learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we</p>",
        "<p>can never be what we once were to each other.”</p>\n<p>“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever</p>\n<p>heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again</p>\n<p>the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”</p>\n<p>“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he</p>\n<p>really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent</p>\n<p>would have prevented his coming down again?”</p>",
        "<p>“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his</p>\n<p>modesty.”</p>\n<p>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and</p>\n<p>the little value he put on his own good qualities.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference</p>\n<p>of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving</p>\n<p>heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice</p>",
        "<p>her against him.</p>\n<p>“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried</p>\n<p>Jane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed</p>\n<p>above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such</p>\n<p>another man for you!”</p>\n<p>“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.</p>\n<p>Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your</p>",
        "<p>happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very</p>\n<p>good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”</p>\n<p>The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a</p>\n<p>secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and</p>\n<p>she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her</p>\n<p>neighbours in Meryton.</p>\n<p>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the</p>",
        "<p>world; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,</p>\n<p>they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LVI.</h3>\n<p>One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been</p>\n<p>formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the</p>\n<p>dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the</p>\n<p>sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the</p>\n<p>lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the</p>\n<p>equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses</p>",
        "<p>were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who</p>\n<p>preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that</p>\n<p>somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid</p>\n<p>the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the</p>\n<p>shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three</p>\n<p>continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown</p>\n<p>open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</p>",
        "<p>They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their</p>\n<p>astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even</p>\n<p>inferior to what Elizabeth felt.</p>\n<p>She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no</p>\n<p>other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the</p>\n<p>head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her</p>",
        "<p>name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of</p>\n<p>introduction had been made.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such</p>\n<p>high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting</p>\n<p>for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--</p>\n<p>“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your</p>\n<p>mother?”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.</p>\n<p>“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.</p>\n<p>“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,</p>\n<p>and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,</p>\n<p>who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”</p>\n<p>“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a</p>",
        "<p>short silence.</p>\n<p>“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I</p>\n<p>assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”</p>\n<p>“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in</p>\n<p>summer: the windows are full west.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then</p>\n<p>added,--</p>",
        "<p>“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and</p>\n<p>Mrs. Collins well?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from</p>\n<p>Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no</p>\n<p>letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some</p>",
        "<p>refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,</p>\n<p>declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--</p>\n<p>“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness</p>\n<p>on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you</p>\n<p>will favour me with your company.”</p>\n<p>“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the</p>\n<p>different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,</p>\n<p>attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and</p>\n<p>drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be</p>\n<p>decent-looking rooms, walked on.</p>\n<p>Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her</p>\n<p>waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk</p>",
        "<p>that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for</p>\n<p>conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and</p>\n<p>disagreeable.</p>\n<p>“After a short survey”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>\n<p>“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in</p>\n<p>her face.</p>",
        "<p>As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following</p>\n<p>manner:--</p>\n<p>“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my</p>\n<p>journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I</p>\n<p>come.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account</p>",
        "<p>for the honour of seeing you here.”</p>\n<p>“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to</p>\n<p>know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may</p>\n<p>choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been</p>\n<p>celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such</p>\n<p>moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most</p>\n<p>alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your</p>",
        "<p>sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that</p>\n<p>_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon</p>\n<p>afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I</p>\n<p>_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him</p>\n<p>so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on</p>\n<p>setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to</p>\n<p>you.”</p>",
        "<p>“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring</p>\n<p>with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming</p>\n<p>so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”</p>\n<p>“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”</p>\n<p>“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth</p>\n<p>coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report</p>\n<p>is in existence.”</p>",
        "<p>“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been</p>\n<p>industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a</p>\n<p>report is spread abroad?”</p>\n<p>“I never heard that it was.”</p>\n<p>“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”</p>\n<p>“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_</p>\n<p>may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”</p>",
        "<p>“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has</p>\n<p>he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”</p>\n<p>“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”</p>\n<p>“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his</p>\n<p>reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,</p>\n<p>have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You</p>\n<p>may have drawn him in.”</p>",
        "<p>“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”</p>\n<p>“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such</p>\n<p>language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,</p>\n<p>and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”</p>\n<p>“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as</p>\n<p>this ever induce me to be explicit.”</p>\n<p>“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the</p>",
        "<p>presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is</p>\n<p>engaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”</p>\n<p>“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will</p>\n<p>make an offer to me.”</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--</p>\n<p>“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,</p>\n<p>they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of</p>",
        "<p>_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the</p>\n<p>union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be</p>\n<p>accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of</p>\n<p>inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to</p>\n<p>the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his</p>\n<p>tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of</p>\n<p>propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his</p>",
        "<p>earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no</p>\n<p>other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be</p>\n<p>kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry</p>\n<p>Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the</p>\n<p>marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by</p>\n<p>honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make</p>",
        "<p>another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”</p>\n<p>“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss</p>\n<p>Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or</p>\n<p>friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will</p>\n<p>be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.</p>\n<p>Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned</p>\n<p>by any of us.”</p>",
        "<p>“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily</p>\n<p>attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause</p>\n<p>to repine.”</p>\n<p>“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude</p>\n<p>for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that</p>\n<p>score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came</p>",
        "<p>here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I</p>\n<p>be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s</p>\n<p>whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”</p>\n<p>“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;</p>\n<p>but it will have no effect on _me_.”</p>\n<p>“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my</p>\n<p>nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal</p>",
        "<p>side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,</p>\n<p>honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on</p>\n<p>both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of</p>\n<p>every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide</p>\n<p>them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,</p>\n<p>connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall</p>\n<p>not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to</p>",
        "<p>quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”</p>\n<p>“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that</p>\n<p>sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are</p>\n<p>equal.”</p>\n<p>“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who</p>\n<p>are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their</p>\n<p>condition.”</p>",
        "<p>“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does</p>\n<p>not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”</p>\n<p>“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”</p>\n<p>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a</p>\n<p>moment’s deliberation,--</p>\n<p>“I am not.”</p>",
        "<p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</p>\n<p>“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”</p>\n<p>“I will make no promise of the kind.”</p>\n<p>“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more</p>\n<p>reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I</p>\n<p>will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the</p>\n<p>assurance I require.”</p>",
        "<p>“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into</p>\n<p>anything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry</p>\n<p>your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make</p>\n<p>_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to</p>\n<p>me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on</p>\n<p>his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with</p>\n<p>which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as</p>",
        "<p>frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my</p>\n<p>character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.</p>\n<p>How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,</p>\n<p>I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in</p>\n<p>mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the</p>\n<p>subject.”</p>\n<p>“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the</p>",
        "<p>objections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no</p>\n<p>stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous</p>\n<p>elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a</p>\n<p>patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is</p>\n<p>_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son</p>\n<p>of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of</p>\n<p>what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”</p>",
        "<p>“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.</p>\n<p>“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to</p>\n<p>the house.”</p>\n<p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned</p>\n<p>back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.</p>\n<p>“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!</p>\n<p>Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you</p>",
        "<p>must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”</p>\n<p>“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”</p>\n<p>“You are then resolved to have him?”</p>\n<p>“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,</p>\n<p>which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without</p>\n<p>reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”</p>\n<p>“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the</p>",
        "<p>claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in</p>\n<p>the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”</p>\n<p>“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any</p>\n<p>possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either</p>\n<p>would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the</p>\n<p>resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former</p>\n<p>_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s</p>",
        "<p>concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in</p>\n<p>the scorn.”</p>\n<p>“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I</p>\n<p>shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your</p>\n<p>ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you</p>\n<p>reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”</p>\n<p>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of</p>",
        "<p>the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--</p>\n<p>“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your</p>\n<p>mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her</p>\n<p>Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She</p>\n<p>heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother</p>\n<p>impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady</p>",
        "<p>Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.</p>\n<p>“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”</p>\n<p>“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously</p>\n<p>civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.</p>\n<p>She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through</p>\n<p>Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had</p>\n<p>nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to</p>\n<p>acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.</p>\n<p>“But now it comes out”</p>\n<p>]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LVII.</h3>\n<p>The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw</p>\n<p>Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many</p>\n<p>hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it</p>\n<p>appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings</p>\n<p>for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of</p>",
        "<p>their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;</p>\n<p>till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,</p>\n<p>and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the</p>\n<p>expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply</p>\n<p>the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her</p>\n<p>sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at</p>\n<p>Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the</p>",
        "<p>Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had</p>\n<p>only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had</p>\n<p>looked forward to as possible at some future time.</p>\n<p>In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help</p>\n<p>feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting</p>\n<p>in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to</p>\n<p>prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an</p>",
        "<p>application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar</p>\n<p>representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared</p>\n<p>not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his</p>\n<p>aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose</p>\n<p>that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it</p>\n<p>was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_</p>\n<p>whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would</p>",
        "<p>address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would</p>\n<p>probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak</p>\n<p>and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</p>\n<p>If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often</p>\n<p>seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might</p>\n<p>settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity</p>\n<p>unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady</p>",
        "<p>Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to</p>\n<p>Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.</p>\n<p>“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his</p>\n<p>friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand</p>\n<p>it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his</p>\n<p>constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might</p>\n<p>have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him</p>",
        "<p>at all.”</p>\n<p>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had</p>\n<p>been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same</p>\n<p>kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.</p>\n<p>The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her</p>\n<p>father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.</p>",
        "<p>“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”</p>\n<p>She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell</p>\n<p>her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner</p>\n<p>connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might</p>\n<p>be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the</p>\n<p>consequent explanations.</p>\n<p>She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He</p>",
        "<p>then said,--</p>\n<p>“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me</p>\n<p>exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its</p>\n<p>contents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink</p>\n<p>of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”</p>\n<p>The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous</p>\n<p>conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;</p>",
        "<p>and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained</p>\n<p>himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to</p>\n<p>herself, when her father continued,--</p>\n<p>“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters</p>\n<p>as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the</p>\n<p>name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”</p>\n<p>“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”</p>",
        "<p>“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with</p>\n<p>congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of</p>\n<p>which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping</p>\n<p>Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says</p>\n<p>on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus</p>\n<p>offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on</p>\n<p>this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,</p>",
        "<p>of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after</p>\n<p>her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate</p>\n<p>may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages</p>\n<p>in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?</p>\n<p>‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the</p>\n<p>heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and</p>",
        "<p>extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn</p>\n<p>my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a</p>\n<p>precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,</p>\n<p>you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,</p>\n<p>Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for</p>\n<p>cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly</p>",
        "<p>eye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_</p>\n<p>surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within</p>\n<p>the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more</p>\n<p>effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any</p>\n<p>woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in</p>\n<p>his life! It is admirable!”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force</p>",
        "<p>one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so</p>\n<p>little agreeable to her.</p>\n<p>“Are you not diverted?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”</p>\n<p>“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last</p>\n<p>night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she</p>\n<p>felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of</p>",
        "<p>some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give</p>\n<p>her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my</p>\n<p>duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she</p>\n<p>and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run</p>\n<p>hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.</p>\n<p>Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad</p>\n<p>business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their</p>",
        "<p>living together before the marriage took place should be so generally</p>\n<p>known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain</p>\n<p>from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young</p>\n<p>couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an</p>\n<p>encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should</p>\n<p>very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as</p>\n<p>a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their</p>",
        "<p>names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of</p>\n<p>Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear</p>\n<p>Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,</p>\n<p>Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be</p>\n<p>_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For</p>\n<p>what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them</p>\n<p>in our turn?”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so</p>\n<p>strange!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man</p>\n<p>it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_</p>\n<p>pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate</p>\n<p>writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any</p>\n<p>consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving</p>",
        "<p>him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and</p>\n<p>hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine</p>\n<p>about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”</p>\n<p>To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had</p>\n<p>been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his</p>\n<p>repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her</p>\n<p>feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she</p>",
        "<p>would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by</p>\n<p>what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but</p>\n<p>wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of</p>\n<p>his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.</p>\n<p>“The efforts of his aunt”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LVIII.</h3>\n<p>Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as</p>\n<p>Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy</p>\n<p>with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s</p>\n<p>visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to</p>\n<p>tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in</p>\n<p>momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed</p>",
        "<p>their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the</p>\n<p>habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five</p>\n<p>set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to</p>\n<p>outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy</p>\n<p>were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was</p>\n<p>too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a</p>\n<p>desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.</p>",
        "<p>They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon</p>\n<p>Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,</p>\n<p>when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the</p>\n<p>moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was</p>\n<p>high, she immediately said,--</p>\n<p>“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving</p>\n<p>relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I</p>",
        "<p>can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor</p>\n<p>sister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to</p>\n<p>acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest</p>\n<p>of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise</p>\n<p>and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a</p>\n<p>mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner</p>",
        "<p>was so little to be trusted.”</p>\n<p>“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to</p>\n<p>me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could</p>\n<p>not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,</p>\n<p>in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced</p>\n<p>you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the</p>\n<p>sake of discovering them.”</p>",
        "<p>“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.</p>\n<p>That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other</p>\n<p>inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your</p>\n<p>_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought</p>\n<p>only of _you_.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,</p>\n<p>her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your</p>",
        "<p>feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_</p>\n<p>affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence</p>\n<p>me on this subject for ever.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of</p>\n<p>his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not</p>\n<p>very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone</p>\n<p>so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make</p>",
        "<p>her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The</p>\n<p>happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never</p>\n<p>felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as</p>\n<p>warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth</p>\n<p>been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the</p>\n<p>expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but</p>\n<p>though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings</p>",
        "<p>which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection</p>\n<p>every moment more valuable.</p>\n<p>They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to</p>\n<p>be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She</p>\n<p>soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding</p>\n<p>to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through</p>\n<p>London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the</p>",
        "<p>substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on</p>\n<p>every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,</p>\n<p>peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that</p>\n<p>such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from</p>\n<p>her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her</p>\n<p>Ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.</p>\n<p>“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself</p>",
        "<p>to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that</p>\n<p>had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have</p>\n<p>acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of</p>\n<p>my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so</p>\n<p>abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all</p>\n<p>your relations.”</p>",
        "<p>“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your</p>\n<p>accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour</p>\n<p>to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was</p>\n<p>unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”</p>\n<p>“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that</p>\n<p>evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly</p>\n<p>examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,</p>",
        "<p>improved in civility.”</p>\n<p>“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I</p>\n<p>then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of</p>\n<p>it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your</p>\n<p>reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a</p>\n<p>more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can</p>\n<p>scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I</p>",
        "<p>confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”</p>\n<p>“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an</p>\n<p>impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such</p>\n<p>a way.”</p>\n<p>“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper</p>\n<p>feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never</p>\n<p>forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible</p>",
        "<p>way that would induce you to accept me.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at</p>\n<p>all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”</p>\n<p>Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you</p>\n<p>think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its</p>\n<p>contents?”</p>\n<p>She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all</p>",
        "<p>her former prejudices had been removed.</p>\n<p>“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was</p>\n<p>necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,</p>\n<p>especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power</p>\n<p>of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly</p>\n<p>make you hate me.”</p>\n<p>“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the</p>",
        "<p>preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my</p>\n<p>opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily</p>\n<p>changed as that implies.”</p>\n<p>“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly</p>\n<p>calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a</p>\n<p>dreadful bitterness of spirit.”</p>\n<p>“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The</p>",
        "<p>adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings</p>\n<p>of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely</p>\n<p>different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance</p>\n<p>attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my</p>\n<p>philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you</p>\n<p>pleasure.”</p>\n<p>“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_</p>",
        "<p>retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment</p>\n<p>arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of</p>\n<p>ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will</p>\n<p>intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a</p>\n<p>selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a</p>\n<p>child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my</p>\n<p>temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride</p>",
        "<p>and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),</p>\n<p>I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father</p>\n<p>particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,</p>\n<p>almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond</p>\n<p>my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to</p>\n<p>_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with</p>\n<p>my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might</p>",
        "<p>still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not</p>\n<p>owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most</p>\n<p>advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a</p>\n<p>doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my</p>\n<p>pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”</p>\n<p>“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”</p>\n<p>“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be</p>",
        "<p>wishing, expecting my addresses.”</p>\n<p>“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure</p>\n<p>you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me</p>\n<p>wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”</p>\n<p>“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to</p>\n<p>take a proper direction.”</p>\n<p>“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at</p>",
        "<p>Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”</p>\n<p>“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”</p>\n<p>“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.</p>\n<p>My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I</p>\n<p>confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”</p>\n<p>“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility</p>\n<p>in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped</p>",
        "<p>to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you</p>\n<p>see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes</p>\n<p>introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half</p>\n<p>an hour after I had seen you.”</p>\n<p>He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her</p>\n<p>disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to</p>\n<p>the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of</p>",
        "<p>following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed</p>\n<p>before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there</p>\n<p>had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must</p>\n<p>comprehend.</p>\n<p>She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to</p>\n<p>each to be dwelt on farther.</p>\n<p>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know</p>",
        "<p>anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that</p>\n<p>it was time to be at home.</p>\n<p>“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which</p>\n<p>introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with</p>\n<p>their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.</p>",
        "<p>“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”</p>\n<p>“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And</p>\n<p>though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much</p>\n<p>the case.</p>\n<p>“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a</p>\n<p>confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told</p>\n<p>him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his</p>",
        "<p>affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had</p>\n<p>the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself</p>\n<p>mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent</p>\n<p>to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was</p>\n<p>unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his</p>\n<p>friend.</p>",
        "<p>“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him</p>\n<p>that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”</p>\n<p>“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits</p>\n<p>which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”</p>\n<p>“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to</p>\n<p>him.”</p>\n<p>“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had</p>",
        "<p>prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but</p>\n<p>his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one</p>\n<p>thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not</p>\n<p>allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months</p>\n<p>last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was</p>\n<p>angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained</p>\n<p>in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me</p>",
        "<p>now.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful</p>\n<p>friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked</p>\n<p>herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and</p>\n<p>it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of</p>\n<p>Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he</p>\n<p>continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they</p>",
        "<p>parted.</p>\n<p>“Unable to utter a syllable”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LIX.</h3>\n<p>“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question</p>\n<p>which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and</p>\n<p>from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in</p>\n<p>reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own</p>\n<p>knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything</p>\n<p>else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</p>",
        "<p>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The</p>\n<p>acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.</p>\n<p>Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;</p>\n<p>and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy</p>\n<p>than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,</p>\n<p>there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in</p>\n<p>the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one</p>",
        "<p>liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a</p>\n<p>_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</p>\n<p>At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far</p>\n<p>from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.</p>\n<p>“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,</p>\n<p>you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”</p>\n<p>“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;</p>",
        "<p>and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I</p>\n<p>am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we</p>\n<p>are engaged.”</p>\n<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much</p>\n<p>you dislike him.”</p>\n<p>“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I</p>\n<p>did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these</p>",
        "<p>a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever</p>\n<p>remember it myself.”</p>\n<p>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more</p>\n<p>seriously, assured her of its truth.</p>\n<p>“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried</p>\n<p>Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you</p>\n<p>certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be</p>",
        "<p>happy with him?”</p>\n<p>“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we</p>\n<p>are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?</p>\n<p>Shall you like to have such a brother?”</p>\n<p>“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more</p>\n<p>delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you</p>\n<p>really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than</p>",
        "<p>marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought</p>\n<p>to do?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I</p>\n<p>tell you all.”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?”</p>\n<p>“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am</p>\n<p>afraid you will be angry.”</p>",
        "<p>“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.</p>\n<p>Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me</p>\n<p>how long you have loved him?”</p>\n<p>“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;</p>\n<p>but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds</p>\n<p>at Pemberley.”</p>\n<p>Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the</p>",
        "<p>desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of</p>\n<p>attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing</p>\n<p>further to wish.</p>\n<p>“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I</p>\n<p>always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I</p>\n<p>must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your</p>\n<p>husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,</p>",
        "<p>Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you</p>\n<p>tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know</p>\n<p>of it to another, not to you.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to</p>\n<p>mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made</p>\n<p>her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer</p>\n<p>conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,</p>",
        "<p>and half the night spent in conversation.</p>\n<p>“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next</p>\n<p>morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with</p>\n<p>our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always</p>\n<p>coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or</p>\n<p>other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?</p>\n<p>Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s</p>",
        "<p>way.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet</p>\n<p>was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an</p>\n<p>epithet.</p>\n<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and</p>\n<p>shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;</p>\n<p>and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes</p>",
        "<p>hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”</p>\n<p>“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk</p>\n<p>to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has</p>\n<p>never seen the view.”</p>\n<p>“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am</p>\n<p>sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”</p>\n<p>Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great</p>",
        "<p>curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently</p>\n<p>consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,</p>\n<p>saying,--</p>\n<p>“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that</p>\n<p>disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is</p>\n<p>all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to</p>\n<p>him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”</p>",
        "<p>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be</p>\n<p>asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the</p>\n<p>application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother</p>\n<p>would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur</p>\n<p>would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she</p>\n<p>were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it</p>\n<p>was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to</p>",
        "<p>her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the</p>\n<p>first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her</p>\n<p>disapprobation.</p>\n<p>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was</p>\n<p>extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to</p>\n<p>be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,</p>",
        "<p>his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be</p>\n<p>filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched</p>\n<p>reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,</p>\n<p>looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes</p>\n<p>he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while</p>\n<p>pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he</p>\n<p>wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.</p>",
        "<p>Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.</p>\n<p>“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be</p>\n<p>accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”</p>\n<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more</p>\n<p>reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from</p>\n<p>explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;</p>\n<p>but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,</p>",
        "<p>of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.</p>\n<p>“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be</p>\n<p>sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.</p>\n<p>But will they make you happy?”</p>\n<p>“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my</p>\n<p>indifference?”</p>\n<p>“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but</p>",
        "<p>this would be nothing if you really liked him.”</p>\n<p>“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.</p>\n<p>Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not</p>\n<p>know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in</p>\n<p>such terms.”</p>\n<p>“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind</p>\n<p>of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he</p>",
        "<p>condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on</p>\n<p>having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your</p>\n<p>disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor</p>\n<p>respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked</p>\n<p>up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the</p>\n<p>greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape</p>\n<p>discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing</p>",
        "<p>_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are</p>\n<p>about.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;</p>\n<p>and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the</p>\n<p>object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her</p>\n<p>estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that</p>\n<p>his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many</p>",
        "<p>months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,</p>\n<p>she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the</p>\n<p>match.</p>\n<p>“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to</p>\n<p>say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with</p>\n<p>you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”</p>\n<p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy</p>",
        "<p>had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.</p>\n<p>“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;</p>\n<p>made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him</p>\n<p>his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble</p>\n<p>and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have</p>\n<p>paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own</p>\n<p>way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about</p>",
        "<p>his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”</p>\n<p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading</p>\n<p>Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her</p>\n<p>at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come</p>\n<p>for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”</p>\n<p>Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after</p>\n<p>half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join</p>",
        "<p>the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for</p>\n<p>gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer</p>\n<p>anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity</p>\n<p>would come in time.</p>\n<p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,</p>\n<p>and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;</p>\n<p>for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to</p>",
        "<p>utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could</p>\n<p>comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what</p>\n<p>was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a</p>\n<p>lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in</p>\n<p>her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</p>\n<p>“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would</p>\n<p>have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich</p>",
        "<p>and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages</p>\n<p>you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so</p>\n<p>pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my</p>\n<p>dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I</p>\n<p>hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything</p>\n<p>that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,</p>\n<p>Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”</p>",
        "<p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,</p>\n<p>soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,</p>\n<p>her mother followed her.</p>\n<p>“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten</p>\n<p>thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a</p>\n<p>special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.</p>",
        "<p>But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond</p>\n<p>of, that I may have it to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman</p>\n<p>himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain</p>\n<p>possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’</p>\n<p>consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow</p>\n<p>passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood</p>",
        "<p>in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak</p>\n<p>to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark</p>\n<p>her deference for his opinion.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get</p>\n<p>acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising</p>\n<p>every hour in his esteem.</p>\n<p>“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,</p>",
        "<p>is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well</p>\n<p>as Jane’s.”</p>\n<p>“The obsequious civility.”</p>\n<p>[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LX.</h3>\n<p>Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.</p>\n<p>Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could</p>\n<p>you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when</p>\n<p>you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first</p>\n<p>place?”</p>\n<p>“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which</p>",
        "<p>laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I</p>\n<p>knew that I _had_ begun.”</p>\n<p>“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour</p>\n<p>to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke</p>\n<p>to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be</p>\n<p>sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”</p>\n<p>“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”</p>",
        "<p>“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.</p>\n<p>The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious</p>\n<p>attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,</p>\n<p>and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and</p>\n<p>interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really</p>\n<p>amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you</p>\n<p>took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and</p>",
        "<p>in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously</p>\n<p>courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;</p>\n<p>and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly</p>\n<p>reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks</p>\n<p>of _that_ when they fall in love.”</p>\n<p>“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was</p>\n<p>ill at Netherfield?”</p>",
        "<p>“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it</p>\n<p>by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are</p>\n<p>to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me</p>\n<p>to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may</p>\n<p>be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling</p>\n<p>to come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you</p>\n<p>first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you</p>",
        "<p>called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”</p>\n<p>“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”</p>\n<p>“But I was embarrassed.”</p>\n<p>“And so was I.”</p>\n<p>“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”</p>\n<p>“A man who had felt less might.”</p>\n<p>“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that</p>",
        "<p>I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you</p>\n<p>_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when</p>\n<p>you _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of</p>\n<p>thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too</p>\n<p>much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort</p>\n<p>springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the</p>\n<p>subject? This will never do.”</p>",
        "<p>“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady</p>\n<p>Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of</p>\n<p>removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to</p>\n<p>your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to</p>\n<p>wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,</p>\n<p>and I was determined at once to know everything.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,</p>",
        "<p>for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to</p>\n<p>Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?</p>\n<p>or had you intended any more serious consequences?”</p>\n<p>“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I</p>\n<p>might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to</p>\n<p>myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and</p>\n<p>if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”</p>",
        "<p>“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to</p>\n<p>befall her?”</p>\n<p>“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to</p>\n<p>be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done</p>\n<p>directly.”</p>\n<p>“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and</p>\n<p>admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But</p>",
        "<p>I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”</p>\n<p>From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy</p>\n<p>had been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s</p>\n<p>long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would</p>\n<p>be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt</p>\n<p>had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as</p>\n<p>follows:--</p>",
        "<p>“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,</p>\n<p>for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the</p>\n<p>truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.</p>\n<p>But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,</p>\n<p>indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will</p>\n<p>afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly</p>\n<p>err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more</p>",
        "<p>than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to</p>\n<p>the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the</p>\n<p>ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the</p>\n<p>happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so</p>\n<p>before, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she</p>\n<p>only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that</p>\n<p>can be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.</p>",
        "<p>Yours,” etc.</p>\n<p>Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still</p>\n<p>different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return</p>\n<p>for his last.</p>\n<p>/* “Dear Sir, */</p>\n<p>“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will</p>\n<p>soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as</p>",
        "<p>you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has</p>\n<p>more to give.</p>\n<p>“Yours sincerely,” etc.</p>\n<p>Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching</p>\n<p>marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to</p>\n<p>Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former</p>\n<p>professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and</p>",
        "<p>though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much</p>\n<p>kinder answer than she knew was deserved.</p>\n<p>The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was</p>\n<p>as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were</p>\n<p>insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of</p>\n<p>being loved by her sister.</p>\n<p>Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations</p>",
        "<p>to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the</p>\n<p>Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this</p>\n<p>sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so</p>\n<p>exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that</p>\n<p>Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till</p>\n<p>the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend</p>\n<p>was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their</p>",
        "<p>meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she</p>\n<p>saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her</p>\n<p>husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even</p>\n<p>listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away</p>\n<p>the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all</p>\n<p>meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did</p>\n<p>shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.</p>",
        "<p>Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his</p>\n<p>forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in</p>\n<p>too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s</p>\n<p>good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be</p>\n<p>vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at</p>\n<p>all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to</p>\n<p>shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to</p>",
        "<p>keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might</p>\n<p>converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings</p>\n<p>arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its</p>\n<p>pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward</p>\n<p>with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so</p>\n<p>little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their</p>\n<p>family party at Pemberley.</p>",
        "<h3>CHAPTER LXI.</h3>\n<p>Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got</p>\n<p>rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she</p>\n<p>afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be</p>\n<p>guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the</p>\n<p>accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of</p>\n<p>her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,</p>",
        "<p>amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,</p>\n<p>it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic</p>\n<p>felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous</p>\n<p>and invariably silly.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her</p>\n<p>drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in</p>\n<p>going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.</p>",
        "<p>Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near</p>\n<p>a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to</p>\n<p>_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his</p>\n<p>sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county</p>\n<p>to Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source</p>\n<p>of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.</p>\n<p>Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with</p>",
        "<p>her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally</p>\n<p>known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a</p>\n<p>temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she</p>\n<p>became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less</p>\n<p>ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s</p>\n<p>society she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham</p>\n<p>frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of</p>",
        "<p>balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.</p>\n<p>Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily</p>\n<p>drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite</p>\n<p>unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but</p>\n<p>she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no</p>\n<p>longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,</p>\n<p>it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without</p>",
        "<p>much reluctance.</p>\n<p>As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from</p>\n<p>the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that</p>\n<p>Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude</p>\n<p>and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of</p>\n<p>everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be</p>\n<p>prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which</p>",
        "<p>Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by</p>\n<p>his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The</p>\n<p>letter was to this effect:--</p>\n<p>/* “My dear Lizzy, */</p>\n<p>“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear</p>\n<p>Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you</p>\n<p>so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will</p>",
        "<p>think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very</p>\n<p>much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live</p>\n<p>upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four</p>\n<p>hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,</p>\n<p>if you had rather not.</p>\n<p>“Yours,” etc.</p>\n<p>As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in</p>",
        "<p>her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.</p>\n<p>Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice</p>\n<p>of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she</p>\n<p>frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an</p>\n<p>income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in</p>\n<p>their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to</p>\n<p>their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or</p>",
        "<p>herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards</p>\n<p>discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the</p>\n<p>restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the</p>\n<p>extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a</p>\n<p>cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection</p>\n<p>for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,</p>\n<p>in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to</p>",
        "<p>reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never</p>\n<p>receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him</p>\n<p>further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when</p>\n<p>her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the</p>\n<p>Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even</p>\n<p>Bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_</p>\n<p>of giving them a hint to be gone.</p>",
        "<p>Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she</p>\n<p>thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she</p>\n<p>dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as</p>\n<p>attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility</p>\n<p>to Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters</p>\n<p>was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each</p>",
        "<p>other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion</p>\n<p>in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an</p>\n<p>astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of</p>\n<p>talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect</p>\n<p>which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open</p>\n<p>pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in</p>\n<p>her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a</p>",
        "<p>woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not</p>\n<p>always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</p>\n<p>Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;</p>\n<p>and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in</p>\n<p>her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him</p>\n<p>language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time</p>\n<p>all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,</p>",
        "<p>he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;</p>\n<p>and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her</p>\n<p>resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity</p>\n<p>to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on</p>\n<p>them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had</p>\n<p>received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the</p>\n<p>visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.</p>",
        "<p>With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,</p>\n<p>as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever</p>\n<p>sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing</p>\n<p>her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.</p>\n<p>THE</p>\n<p>END</p>\n<p>]</p>",
