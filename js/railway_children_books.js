        "<h3>Chapter I.</h3>\n<p>The beginning of things.</p>\n<p>They were not railway children to begin with. I don't</p>\n<p>suppose they had ever thought about railways except as a</p>\n<p>means of getting to Maskelyne and Cook's, the Pantomime, Zoological</p>\n<p>Gardens, and Madame Tussaud's. They were just ordinary suburban children,</p>\n<p>and they lived with their Father and Mother in an</p>\n<p>ordinary red-brick-fronted villa, with coloured glass in the front door,</p>",
        "<p>a tiled passage that was called a hall, a bath-room</p>\n<p>with hot and cold water, electric bells, French windows, and</p>\n<p>a good deal of white paint, and 'every modern convenience',</p>\n<p>as the house-agents say.</p>\n<p>There were three of them. Roberta was the eldest. Of</p>\n<p>course, Mothers never have favourites, but if their Mother HAD</p>\n<p>had a favourite, it might have been Roberta. Next came</p>",
        "<p>Peter, who wished to be an Engineer when he grew</p>\n<p>up; and the youngest was Phyllis, who meant extremely well.</p>\n<p>Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull</p>\n<p>calls to dull ladies, and sitting dully at home waiting</p>\n<p>for dull ladies to pay calls to her. She was</p>\n<p>almost always there, ready to play with the children, and</p>\n<p>read to them, and help them to do their home-lessons.</p>",
        "<p>Besides this she used to write stories for them while</p>\n<p>they were at school, and read them aloud after tea,</p>\n<p>and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for</p>\n<p>their birthdays and for other great occasions, such as the</p>\n<p>christening of the new kittens, or the refurnishing of the</p>\n<p>doll's house, or the time when they were getting over</p>\n<p>the mumps.</p>",
        "<p>These three lucky children always had everything they needed: pretty</p>\n<p>clothes, good fires, a lovely nursery with heaps of toys,</p>\n<p>and a Mother Goose wall-paper. They had a kind and</p>\n<p>merry nursemaid, and a dog who was called James, and</p>\n<p>who was their very own. They also had a Father</p>\n<p>who was just perfect--never cross, never unjust, and always ready</p>\n<p>for a game--at least, if at any time he was</p>",
        "<p>NOT ready, he always had an excellent reason for it,</p>\n<p>and explained the reason to the children so interestingly and</p>\n<p>funnily that they felt sure he couldn't help himself.</p>\n<p>You will think that they ought to have been very</p>\n<p>happy. And so they were, but they did not know</p>\n<p>HOW happy till the pretty life in the Red Villa</p>\n<p>was over and done with, and they had to live</p>",
        "<p>a very different life indeed.</p>\n<p>The dreadful change came quite suddenly.</p>\n<p>Peter had a birthday--his tenth. Among his other presents was</p>\n<p>a model engine more perfect than you could ever have</p>\n<p>dreamed of. The other presents were full of charm, but</p>\n<p>the Engine was fuller of charm than any of the</p>\n<p>others were.</p>",
        "<p>Its charm lasted in its full perfection for exactly three</p>\n<p>days. Then, owing either to Peter's inexperience or Phyllis's good</p>\n<p>intentions, which had been rather pressing, or to some other</p>\n<p>cause, the Engine suddenly went off with a bang. James</p>\n<p>was so frightened that he went out and did not</p>\n<p>come back all day. All the Noah's Ark people who</p>\n<p>were in the tender were broken to bits, but nothing</p>",
        "<p>else was hurt except the poor little engine and the</p>\n<p>feelings of Peter. The others said he cried over it--but</p>\n<p>of course boys of ten do not cry, however terrible</p>\n<p>the tragedies may be which darken their lot. He said</p>\n<p>that his eyes were red because he had a cold.</p>\n<p>This turned out to be true, though Peter did not</p>\n<p>know it was when he said it, the next day</p>",
        "<p>he had to go to bed and stay there. Mother</p>\n<p>began to be afraid that he might be sickening for</p>\n<p>measles, when suddenly he sat up in bed and said:</p>\n<p>“I hate gruel--I hate barley water--I hate bread and milk.</p>\n<p>I want to get up and have something REAL to</p>\n<p>eat.”</p>\n<p>“What would you like?” Mother asked.</p>",
        "<p>“A pigeon-pie,” said Peter, eagerly, “a large pigeon-pie. A very</p>\n<p>large one.”</p>\n<p>So Mother asked the Cook to make a large pigeon-pie.</p>\n<p>The pie was made. And when the pie was made,</p>\n<p>it was cooked. And when it was cooked, Peter ate</p>\n<p>some of it. After that his cold was better. Mother</p>\n<p>made a piece of poetry to amuse him while the</p>",
        "<p>pie was being made. It began by saying what an</p>\n<p>unfortunate but worthy boy Peter was, then it went on:</p>\n<p>He had an engine that he loved With all his</p>\n<p>heart and soul, And if he had a wish on</p>\n<p>earth It was to keep it whole.</p>\n<p>One day--my friends, prepare your minds; I'm coming to the</p>\n<p>worst-- Quite suddenly a screw went mad, And then the</p>",
        "<p>boiler burst!</p>\n<p>With gloomy face he picked it up And took it</p>\n<p>to his Mother, Though even he could not suppose That</p>\n<p>she could make another;</p>\n<p>For those who perished on the line He did not</p>\n<p>seem to care, His engine being more to him Than</p>\n<p>all the people there.</p>",
        "<p>And now you see the reason why Our Peter has</p>\n<p>been ill: He soothes his soul with pigeon-pie His gnawing</p>\n<p>grief to kill.</p>\n<p>He wraps himself in blankets warm And sleeps in bed</p>\n<p>till late, Determined thus to overcome His miserable fate.</p>\n<p>And if his eyes are rather red, His cold must</p>\n<p>just excuse it: Offer him pie; you may be sure</p>",
        "<p>He never will refuse it.</p>\n<p>Father had been away in the country for three or</p>\n<p>four days. All Peter's hopes for the curing of his</p>\n<p>afflicted Engine were now fixed on his Father, for Father</p>\n<p>was most wonderfully clever with his fingers. He could mend</p>\n<p>all sorts of things. He had often acted as veterinary</p>\n<p>surgeon to the wooden rocking-horse; once he had saved its</p>",
        "<p>life when all human aid was despaired of, and the</p>\n<p>poor creature was given up for lost, and even the</p>\n<p>carpenter said he didn't see his way to do anything.</p>\n<p>And it was Father who mended the doll's cradle when</p>\n<p>no one else could; and with a little glue and</p>\n<p>some bits of wood and a pen-knife made all the</p>\n<p>Noah's Ark beasts as strong on their pins as ever</p>",
        "<p>they were, if not stronger.</p>\n<p>Peter, with heroic unselfishness, did not say anything about his</p>\n<p>Engine till after Father had had his dinner and his</p>\n<p>after-dinner cigar. The unselfishness was Mother's idea--but it was Peter</p>\n<p>who carried it out. And needed a good deal of</p>\n<p>patience, too.</p>\n<p>At last Mother said to Father, “Now, dear, if you're</p>",
        "<p>quite rested, and quite comfy, we want to tell you</p>\n<p>about the great railway accident, and ask your advice.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said Father, “fire away!”</p>\n<p>So then Peter told the sad tale, and fetched what</p>\n<p>was left of the Engine.</p>\n<p>“Hum,” said Father, when he had looked the Engine over</p>\n<p>very carefully.</p>",
        "<p>The children held their breaths.</p>\n<p>“Is there NO hope?” said Peter, in a low, unsteady</p>\n<p>voice.</p>\n<p>“Hope? Rather! Tons of it,” said Father, cheerfully; “but it'll</p>\n<p>want something besides hope--a bit of brazing say, or some</p>\n<p>solder, and a new valve. I think we'd better keep</p>\n<p>it for a rainy day. In other words, I'll give</p>",
        "<p>up Saturday afternoon to it, and you shall all help</p>\n<p>me.”</p>\n<p>“CAN girls help to mend engines?” Peter asked doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“Of course they can. Girls are just as clever as</p>\n<p>boys, and don't you forget it! How would you like</p>\n<p>to be an engine-driver, Phil?”</p>\n<p>“My face would be always dirty, wouldn't it?” said Phyllis,</p>",
        "<p>in unenthusiastic tones, “and I expect I should break something.”</p>\n<p>“I should just love it,” said Roberta--“do you think I</p>\n<p>could when I'm grown up, Daddy? Or even a stoker?”</p>\n<p>“You mean a fireman,” said Daddy, pulling and twisting at</p>\n<p>the engine. “Well, if you still wish it, when you're</p>\n<p>grown up, we'll see about making you a fire-woman. I</p>\n<p>remember when I was a boy--”</p>",
        "<p>Just then there was a knock at the front door.</p>\n<p>“Who on earth!” said Father. “An Englishman's house is his</p>\n<p>castle, of course, but I do wish they built semi-detached</p>\n<p>villas with moats and drawbridges.”</p>\n<p>Ruth--she was the parlour-maid and had red hair--came in and</p>\n<p>said that two gentlemen wanted to see the master.</p>\n<p>“I've shown them into the Library, Sir,” said she.</p>",
        "<p>“I expect it's the subscription to the Vicar's testimonial,” said</p>\n<p>Mother, “or else it's the choir holiday fund. Get rid</p>\n<p>of them quickly, dear. It does break up an evening</p>\n<p>so, and it's nearly the children's bedtime.”</p>\n<p>But Father did not seem to be able to get</p>\n<p>rid of the gentlemen at all quickly.</p>\n<p>“I wish we HAD got a moat and drawbridge,” said</p>",
        "<p>Roberta; “then, when we didn't want people, we could just</p>\n<p>pull up the drawbridge and no one else could get</p>\n<p>in. I expect Father will have forgotten about when he</p>\n<p>was a boy if they stay much longer.”</p>\n<p>Mother tried to make the time pass by telling them</p>\n<p>a new fairy story about a Princess with green eyes,</p>\n<p>but it was difficult because they could hear the voices</p>",
        "<p>of Father and the gentlemen in the Library, and Father's</p>\n<p>voice sounded louder and different to the voice he generally</p>\n<p>used to people who came about testimonials and holiday funds.</p>\n<p>Then the Library bell rang, and everyone heaved a breath</p>\n<p>of relief.</p>\n<p>“They're going now,” said Phyllis; “he's rung to have them</p>\n<p>shown out.”</p>",
        "<p>But instead of showing anybody out, Ruth showed herself in,</p>\n<p>and she looked queer, the children thought.</p>\n<p>“Please'm,” she said, “the Master wants you to just step</p>\n<p>into the study. He looks like the dead, mum; I</p>\n<p>think he's had bad news. You'd best prepare yourself for</p>\n<p>the worst, 'm--p'raps it's a death in the family or</p>\n<p>a bank busted or--”</p>",
        "<p>“That'll do, Ruth,” said Mother gently; “you can go.”</p>\n<p>Then Mother went into the Library. There was more talking.</p>\n<p>Then the bell rang again, and Ruth fetched a cab.</p>\n<p>The children heard boots go out and down the steps.</p>\n<p>The cab drove away, and the front door shut. Then</p>\n<p>Mother came in. Her dear face was as white as</p>\n<p>her lace collar, and her eyes looked very big and</p>",
        "<p>shining. Her mouth looked like just a line of pale</p>\n<p>red--her lips were thin and not their proper shape at</p>\n<p>all.</p>\n<p>“It's bedtime,” she said. “Ruth will put you to bed.”</p>\n<p>“But you promised we should sit up late tonight because</p>\n<p>Father's come home,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Father's been called away--on business,” said Mother. “Come, darlings, go</p>",
        "<p>at once.”</p>\n<p>They kissed her and went. Roberta lingered to give Mother</p>\n<p>an extra hug and to whisper:</p>\n<p>“It wasn't bad news, Mammy, was it? Is anyone dead--or--”</p>\n<p>“Nobody's dead--no,” said Mother, and she almost seemed to push</p>\n<p>Roberta away. “I can't tell you anything tonight, my pet.</p>\n<p>Go, dear, go NOW.”</p>",
        "<p>So Roberta went.</p>\n<p>Ruth brushed the girls' hair and helped them to undress.</p>\n<p>(Mother almost always did this herself.) When she had turned</p>\n<p>down the gas and left them she found Peter, still</p>\n<p>dressed, waiting on the stairs.</p>\n<p>“I say, Ruth, what's up?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Don't ask me no questions and I won't tell you</p>",
        "<p>no lies,” the red-headed Ruth replied. “You'll know soon enough.”</p>\n<p>Late that night Mother came up and kissed all three</p>\n<p>children as they lay asleep. But Roberta was the only</p>\n<p>one whom the kiss woke, and she lay mousey-still, and</p>\n<p>said nothing.</p>\n<p>“If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying,”</p>\n<p>she said to herself as she heard through the dark</p>",
        "<p>the catching of her Mother's breath, “we WON'T know it.</p>\n<p>That's all.”</p>\n<p>When they came down to breakfast the next morning, Mother</p>\n<p>had already gone out.</p>\n<p>“To London,” Ruth said, and left them to their breakfast.</p>\n<p>“There's something awful the matter,” said Peter, breaking his egg.</p>\n<p>“Ruth told me last night we should know soon enough.”</p>",
        "<p>“Did you ASK her?” said Roberta, with scorn.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I did!” said Peter, angrily. “If you could go</p>\n<p>to bed without caring whether Mother was worried or not,</p>\n<p>I couldn't. So there.”</p>\n<p>“I don't think we ought to ask the servants things</p>\n<p>Mother doesn't tell us,” said Roberta.</p>\n<p>“That's right, Miss Goody-goody,” said Peter, “preach away.”</p>",
        "<p>“I'M not goody,” said Phyllis, “but I think Bobbie's right</p>\n<p>this time.”</p>\n<p>“Of course. She always is. In her own opinion,” said</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>“Oh, DON'T!” cried Roberta, putting down her egg-spoon; “don't let's</p>\n<p>be horrid to each other. I'm sure some dire calamity</p>\n<p>is happening. Don't let's make it worse!”</p>",
        "<p>“Who began, I should like to know?” said Peter.</p>\n<p>Roberta made an effort, and answered:--</p>\n<p>“I did, I suppose, but--”</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” said Peter, triumphantly. But before he went to</p>\n<p>school he thumped his sister between the shoulders and told</p>\n<p>her to cheer up.</p>\n<p>The children came home to one o'clock dinner, but Mother</p>",
        "<p>was not there. And she was not there at tea-time.</p>\n<p>It was nearly seven before she came in, looking so</p>\n<p>ill and tired that the children felt they could not</p>\n<p>ask her any questions. She sank into an arm-chair. Phyllis</p>\n<p>took the long pins out of her hat, while Roberta</p>\n<p>took off her gloves, and Peter unfastened her walking-shoes and</p>\n<p>fetched her soft velvety slippers for her.</p>",
        "<p>When she had had a cup of tea, and Roberta</p>\n<p>had put eau-de-Cologne on her poor head that ached, Mother</p>\n<p>said:--</p>\n<p>“Now, my darlings, I want to tell you something. Those</p>\n<p>men last night did bring very bad news, and Father</p>\n<p>will be away for some time. I am very worried</p>\n<p>about it, and I want you all to help me,</p>",
        "<p>and not to make things harder for me.”</p>\n<p>“As if we would!” said Roberta, holding Mother's hand against</p>\n<p>her face.</p>\n<p>“You can help me very much,” said Mother, “by being</p>\n<p>good and happy and not quarrelling when I'm away”--Roberta and</p>\n<p>Peter exchanged guilty glances--“for I shall have to be away</p>\n<p>a good deal.”</p>",
        "<p>“We won't quarrel. Indeed we won't,” said everybody. And meant</p>\n<p>it, too.</p>\n<p>“Then,” Mother went on, “I want you not to ask</p>\n<p>me any questions about this trouble; and not to ask</p>\n<p>anybody else any questions.”</p>\n<p>Peter cringed and shuffled his boots on the carpet.</p>\n<p>“You'll promise this, too, won't you?” said Mother.</p>",
        "<p>“I did ask Ruth,” said Peter, suddenly. “I'm very sorry,</p>\n<p>but I did.”</p>\n<p>“And what did she say?”</p>\n<p>“She said I should know soon enough.”</p>\n<p>“It isn't necessary for you to know anything about it,”</p>\n<p>said Mother; “it's about business, and you never do understand</p>\n<p>business, do you?”</p>",
        "<p>“No,” said Roberta; “is it something to do with Government?”</p>\n<p>For Father was in a Government Office.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mother. “Now it's bed-time, my darlings. And don't</p>\n<p>YOU worry. It'll all come right in the end.”</p>\n<p>“Then don't YOU worry either, Mother,” said Phyllis, “and we'll</p>\n<p>all be as good as gold.”</p>\n<p>Mother sighed and kissed them.</p>",
        "<p>“We'll begin being good the first thing tomorrow morning,” said</p>\n<p>Peter, as they went upstairs.</p>\n<p>“Why not NOW?” said Roberta.</p>\n<p>“There's nothing to be good ABOUT now, silly,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“We might begin to try to FEEL good,” said Phyllis,</p>\n<p>“and not call names.”</p>\n<p>“Who's calling names?” said Peter. “Bobbie knows right enough that</p>",
        "<p>when I say 'silly', it's just the same as if</p>\n<p>I said Bobbie.”</p>\n<p>“WELL,” said Roberta.</p>\n<p>“No, I don't mean what you mean. I mean it's</p>\n<p>just a--what is it Father calls it?--a germ of endearment!</p>\n<p>Good night.”</p>\n<p>The girls folded up their clothes with more than usual</p>",
        "<p>neatness--which was the only way of being good that they</p>\n<p>could think of.</p>\n<p>“I say,” said Phyllis, smoothing out her pinafore, “you used</p>\n<p>to say it was so dull--nothing happening, like in books.</p>\n<p>Now something HAS happened.”</p>\n<p>“I never wanted things to happen to make Mother unhappy,”</p>\n<p>said Roberta. “Everything's perfectly horrid.”</p>",
        "<p>Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks.</p>\n<p>Mother was nearly always out. Meals were dull and dirty.</p>\n<p>The between-maid was sent away, and Aunt Emma came on</p>\n<p>a visit. Aunt Emma was much older than Mother. She</p>\n<p>was going abroad to be a governess. She was very</p>\n<p>busy getting her clothes ready, and they were very ugly,</p>\n<p>dingy clothes, and she had them always littering about, and</p>",
        "<p>the sewing-machine seemed to whir--on and on all day and</p>\n<p>most of the night. Aunt Emma believed in keeping children</p>\n<p>in their proper places. And they more than returned the</p>\n<p>compliment. Their idea of Aunt Emma's proper place was anywhere</p>\n<p>where they were not. So they saw very little of</p>\n<p>her. They preferred the company of the servants, who were</p>\n<p>more amusing. Cook, if in a good temper, could sing</p>",
        "<p>comic songs, and the housemaid, if she happened not to</p>\n<p>be offended with you, could imitate a hen that has</p>\n<p>laid an egg, a bottle of champagne being opened, and</p>\n<p>could mew like two cats fighting. The servants never told</p>\n<p>the children what the bad news was that the gentlemen</p>\n<p>had brought to Father. But they kept hinting that they</p>\n<p>could tell a great deal if they chose--and this was</p>",
        "<p>not comfortable.</p>\n<p>One day when Peter had made a booby trap over</p>\n<p>the bath-room door, and it had acted beautifully as Ruth</p>\n<p>passed through, that red-haired parlour-maid caught him and boxed his</p>\n<p>ears.</p>\n<p>“You'll come to a bad end,” she said furiously, “you</p>\n<p>nasty little limb, you! If you don't mend your ways,</p>",
        "<p>you'll go where your precious Father's gone, so I tell</p>\n<p>you straight!”</p>\n<p>Roberta repeated this to her Mother, and next day Ruth</p>\n<p>was sent away.</p>\n<p>Then came the time when Mother came home and went</p>\n<p>to bed and stayed there two days and the Doctor</p>\n<p>came, and the children crept wretchedly about the house and</p>",
        "<p>wondered if the world was coming to an end.</p>\n<p>Mother came down one morning to breakfast, very pale and</p>\n<p>with lines on her face that used not to be</p>\n<p>there. And she smiled, as well as she could, and</p>\n<p>said:--</p>\n<p>“Now, my pets, everything is settled. We're going to leave</p>\n<p>this house, and go and live in the country. Such</p>",
        "<p>a ducky dear little white house. I know you'll love</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>A whirling week of packing followed--not just packing clothes, like</p>\n<p>when you go to the seaside, but packing chairs and</p>\n<p>tables, covering their tops with sacking and their legs with</p>\n<p>straw.</p>\n<p>All sorts of things were packed that you don't pack</p>",
        "<p>when you go to the seaside. Crockery, blankets, candlesticks, carpets,</p>\n<p>bedsteads, saucepans, and even fenders and fire-irons.</p>\n<p>The house was like a furniture warehouse. I think the</p>\n<p>children enjoyed it very much. Mother was very busy, but</p>\n<p>not too busy now to talk to them, and read</p>\n<p>to them, and even to make a bit of poetry</p>\n<p>for Phyllis to cheer her up when she fell down</p>",
        "<p>with a screwdriver and ran it into her hand.</p>\n<p>“Aren't you going to pack this, Mother?” Roberta asked, pointing</p>\n<p>to the beautiful cabinet inlaid with red turtleshell and brass.</p>\n<p>“We can't take everything,” said Mother.</p>\n<p>“But we seem to be taking all the ugly things,”</p>\n<p>said Roberta.</p>\n<p>“We're taking the useful ones,” said Mother; “we've got to</p>",
        "<p>play at being Poor for a bit, my chickabiddy.”</p>\n<p>When all the ugly useful things had been packed up</p>\n<p>and taken away in a van by men in green-baize</p>\n<p>aprons, the two girls and Mother and Aunt Emma slept</p>\n<p>in the two spare rooms where the furniture was all</p>\n<p>pretty. All their beds had gone. A bed was made</p>\n<p>up for Peter on the drawing-room sofa.</p>",
        "<p>“I say, this is larks,” he said, wriggling joyously, as</p>\n<p>Mother tucked him up. “I do like moving! I wish</p>\n<p>we moved once a month.”</p>\n<p>Mother laughed.</p>\n<p>“I don't!” she said. “Good night, Peterkin.”</p>\n<p>As she turned away Roberta saw her face. She never</p>\n<p>forgot it.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, Mother,” she whispered all to herself as she got</p>\n<p>into bed, “how brave you are! How I love you!</p>\n<p>Fancy being brave enough to laugh when you're feeling like</p>\n<p>THAT!”</p>\n<p>Next day boxes were filled, and boxes and more boxes;</p>\n<p>and then late in the afternoon a cab came to</p>\n<p>take them to the station.</p>",
        "<p>Aunt Emma saw them off. They felt that THEY were</p>\n<p>seeing HER off, and they were glad of it.</p>\n<p>“But, oh, those poor little foreign children that she's going</p>\n<p>to governess!” whispered Phyllis. “I wouldn't be them for anything!”</p>\n<p>At first they enjoyed looking out of the window, but</p>\n<p>when it grew dusk they grew sleepier and sleepier, and</p>\n<p>no one knew how long they had been in the</p>",
        "<p>train when they were roused by Mother's shaking them gently</p>\n<p>and saying:--</p>\n<p>“Wake up, dears. We're there.”</p>\n<p>They woke up, cold and melancholy, and stood shivering on</p>\n<p>the draughty platform while the baggage was taken out of</p>\n<p>the train. Then the engine, puffing and blowing, set to</p>\n<p>work again, and dragged the train away. The children watched</p>",
        "<p>the tail-lights of the guard's van disappear into the darkness.</p>\n<p>This was the first train the children saw on that</p>\n<p>railway which was in time to become so very dear</p>\n<p>to them. They did not guess then how they would</p>\n<p>grow to love the railway, and how soon it would</p>\n<p>become the centre of their new life, nor what wonders</p>\n<p>and changes it would bring to them. They only shivered</p>",
        "<p>and sneezed and hoped the walk to the new house</p>\n<p>would not be long. Peter's nose was colder than he</p>\n<p>ever remembered it to have been before. Roberta's hat was</p>\n<p>crooked, and the elastic seemed tighter than usual. Phyllis's shoe-laces</p>\n<p>had come undone.</p>\n<p>“Come,” said Mother, “we've got to walk. There aren't any</p>\n<p>cabs here.”</p>",
        "<p>The walk was dark and muddy. The children stumbled a</p>\n<p>little on the rough road, and once Phyllis absently fell</p>\n<p>into a puddle, and was picked up damp and unhappy.</p>\n<p>There were no gas-lamps on the road, and the road</p>\n<p>was uphill. The cart went at a foot's pace, and</p>\n<p>they followed the gritty crunch of its wheels. As their</p>\n<p>eyes got used to the darkness, they could see the</p>",
        "<p>mound of boxes swaying dimly in front of them.</p>\n<p>A long gate had to be opened for the cart</p>\n<p>to pass through, and after that the road seemed to</p>\n<p>go across fields--and now it went down hill. Presently a</p>\n<p>great dark lumpish thing showed over to the right.</p>\n<p>“There's the house,” said Mother. “I wonder why she's shut</p>\n<p>the shutters.”</p>",
        "<p>“Who's SHE?” asked Roberta.</p>\n<p>“The woman I engaged to clean the place, and put</p>\n<p>the furniture straight and get supper.”</p>\n<p>There was a low wall, and trees inside.</p>\n<p>“That's the garden,” said Mother.</p>\n<p>“It looks more like a dripping-pan full of black cabbages,”</p>\n<p>said Peter.</p>",
        "<p>The cart went on along by the garden wall, and</p>\n<p>round to the back of the house, and here it</p>\n<p>clattered into a cobble-stoned yard and stopped at the back</p>\n<p>door.</p>\n<p>There was no light in any of the windows.</p>\n<p>Everyone hammered at the door, but no one came.</p>\n<p>The man who drove the cart said he expected Mrs.</p>",
        "<p>Viney had gone home.</p>\n<p>“You see your train was that late,” said he.</p>\n<p>“But she's got the key,” said Mother. “What are we</p>\n<p>to do?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, she'll have left that under the doorstep,” said the</p>\n<p>cart man; “folks do hereabouts.” He took the lantern off</p>\n<p>his cart and stooped.</p>",
        "<p>“Ay, here it is, right enough,” he said.</p>\n<p>He unlocked the door and went in and set his</p>\n<p>lantern on the table.</p>\n<p>“Got e'er a candle?” said he.</p>\n<p>“I don't know where anything is.” Mother spoke rather less</p>\n<p>cheerfully than usual.</p>\n<p>He struck a match. There was a candle on the</p>",
        "<p>table, and he lighted it. By its thin little glimmer</p>\n<p>the children saw a large bare kitchen with a stone</p>\n<p>floor. There were no curtains, no hearth-rug. The kitchen table</p>\n<p>from home stood in the middle of the room. The</p>\n<p>chairs were in one corner, and the pots, pans, brooms,</p>\n<p>and crockery in another. There was no fire, and the</p>\n<p>black grate showed cold, dead ashes.</p>",
        "<p>As the cart man turned to go out after he</p>\n<p>had brought in the boxes, there was a rustling, scampering</p>\n<p>sound that seemed to come from inside the walls of</p>\n<p>the house.</p>\n<p>“Oh, what's that?” cried the girls.</p>\n<p>“It's only the rats,” said the cart man. And he</p>\n<p>went away and shut the door, and the sudden draught</p>",
        "<p>of it blew out the candle.</p>\n<p>“Oh, dear,” said Phyllis, “I wish we hadn't come!” and</p>\n<p>she knocked a chair over.</p>\n<p>“ONLY the rats!” said Peter, in the dark.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter II.</h3>\n<p>Peter's coal-mine.</p>\n<p>“What fun!” said Mother, in the dark, feeling for the</p>\n<p>matches on the table. “How frightened the poor mice were--I</p>\n<p>don't believe they were rats at all.”</p>\n<p>She struck a match and relighted the candle and everyone</p>\n<p>looked at each other by its winky, blinky light.</p>\n<p>“Well,” she said, “you've often wanted something to happen and</p>",
        "<p>now it has. This is quite an adventure, isn't it?</p>\n<p>I told Mrs. Viney to get us some bread and</p>\n<p>butter, and meat and things, and to have supper ready.</p>\n<p>I suppose she's laid it in the dining-room. So let's</p>\n<p>go and see.”</p>\n<p>The dining-room opened out of the kitchen. It looked much</p>\n<p>darker than the kitchen when they went in with the</p>",
        "<p>one candle. Because the kitchen was whitewashed, but the dining-room</p>\n<p>was dark wood from floor to ceiling, and across the</p>\n<p>ceiling there were heavy black beams. There was a muddled</p>\n<p>maze of dusty furniture--the breakfast-room furniture from the old home</p>\n<p>where they had lived all their lives. It seemed a</p>\n<p>very long time ago, and a very long way off.</p>\n<p>There was the table certainly, and there were chairs, but</p>",
        "<p>there was no supper.</p>\n<p>“Let's look in the other rooms,” said Mother; and they</p>\n<p>looked. And in each room was the same kind of</p>\n<p>blundering half-arrangement of furniture, and fire-irons and crockery, and all</p>\n<p>sorts of odd things on the floor, but there was</p>\n<p>nothing to eat; even in the pantry there were only</p>\n<p>a rusty cake-tin and a broken plate with whitening mixed</p>",
        "<p>in it.</p>\n<p>“What a horrid old woman!” said Mother; “she's just walked</p>\n<p>off with the money and not got us anything to</p>\n<p>eat at all.”</p>\n<p>“Then shan't we have any supper at all?” asked Phyllis,</p>\n<p>dismayed, stepping back on to a soap-dish that cracked responsively.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes,” said Mother, “only it'll mean unpacking one of</p>",
        "<p>those big cases that we put in the cellar. Phil,</p>\n<p>do mind where you're walking to, there's a dear. Peter,</p>\n<p>hold the light.”</p>\n<p>The cellar door opened out of the kitchen. There were</p>\n<p>five wooden steps leading down. It wasn't a proper cellar</p>\n<p>at all, the children thought, because its ceiling went up</p>\n<p>as high as the kitchen's. A bacon-rack hung under its</p>",
        "<p>ceiling. There was wood in it, and coal. Also the</p>\n<p>big cases.</p>\n<p>Peter held the candle, all on one side, while Mother</p>\n<p>tried to open the great packing-case. It was very securely</p>\n<p>nailed down.</p>\n<p>“Where's the hammer?” asked Peter.</p>\n<p>“That's just it,” said Mother. “I'm afraid it's inside the</p>",
        "<p>box. But there's a coal-shovel--and there's the kitchen poker.”</p>\n<p>And with these she tried to get the case open.</p>\n<p>“Let me do it,” said Peter, thinking he could do</p>\n<p>it better himself. Everyone thinks this when he sees another</p>\n<p>person stirring a fire, or opening a box, or untying</p>\n<p>a knot in a bit of string.</p>\n<p>“You'll hurt your hands, Mammy,” said Roberta; “let me.”</p>",
        "<p>“I wish Father was here,” said Phyllis; “he'd get it</p>\n<p>open in two shakes. What are you kicking me for,</p>\n<p>Bobbie?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn't,” said Roberta.</p>\n<p>Just then the first of the long nails in the</p>\n<p>packing-case began to come out with a scrunch. Then a</p>\n<p>lath was raised and then another, till all four stood</p>",
        "<p>up with the long nails in them shining fiercely like</p>\n<p>iron teeth in the candle-light.</p>\n<p>“Hooray!” said Mother; “here are some candles--the very first thing!</p>\n<p>You girls go and light them. You'll find some saucers</p>\n<p>and things. Just drop a little candle-grease in the saucer</p>\n<p>and stick the candle upright in it.”</p>\n<p>“How many shall we light?”</p>",
        "<p>“As many as ever you like,” said Mother, gaily. “The</p>\n<p>great thing is to be cheerful. Nobody can be cheerful</p>\n<p>in the dark except owls and dormice.”</p>\n<p>So the girls lighted candles. The head of the first</p>\n<p>match flew off and stuck to Phyllis's finger; but, as</p>\n<p>Roberta said, it was only a little burn, and she</p>\n<p>might have had to be a Roman martyr and be</p>",
        "<p>burned whole if she had happened to live in the</p>\n<p>days when those things were fashionable.</p>\n<p>Then, when the dining-room was lighted by fourteen candles, Roberta</p>\n<p>fetched coal and wood and lighted a fire.</p>\n<p>“It's very cold for May,” she said, feeling what a</p>\n<p>grown-up thing it was to say.</p>\n<p>The fire-light and the candle-light made the dining-room look very</p>",
        "<p>different, for now you could see that the dark walls</p>\n<p>were of wood, carved here and there into little wreaths</p>\n<p>and loops.</p>\n<p>The girls hastily 'tidied' the room, which meant putting the</p>\n<p>chairs against the wall, and piling all the odds and</p>\n<p>ends into a corner and partly hiding them with the</p>\n<p>big leather arm-chair that Father used to sit in after</p>",
        "<p>dinner.</p>\n<p>“Bravo!” cried Mother, coming in with a tray full of</p>\n<p>things. “This is something like! I'll just get a tablecloth</p>\n<p>and then--”</p>\n<p>The tablecloth was in a box with a proper lock</p>\n<p>that was opened with a key and not with a</p>\n<p>shovel, and when the cloth was spread on the table,</p>",
        "<p>a real feast was laid out on it.</p>\n<p>Everyone was very, very tired, but everyone cheered up at</p>\n<p>the sight of the funny and delightful supper. There were</p>\n<p>biscuits, the Marie and the plain kind, sardines, preserved ginger,</p>\n<p>cooking raisins, and candied peel and marmalade.</p>\n<p>“What a good thing Aunt Emma packed up all the</p>\n<p>odds and ends out of the Store cupboard,” said Mother.</p>",
        "<p>“Now, Phil, DON'T put the marmalade spoon in among the</p>\n<p>sardines.”</p>\n<p>“No, I won't, Mother,” said Phyllis, and put it down</p>\n<p>among the Marie biscuits.</p>\n<p>“Let's drink Aunt Emma's health,” said Roberta, suddenly; “what should</p>\n<p>we have done if she hadn't packed up these things?</p>\n<p>Here's to Aunt Emma!”</p>",
        "<p>And the toast was drunk in ginger wine and water,</p>\n<p>out of willow-patterned tea-cups, because the glasses couldn't be found.</p>\n<p>They all felt that they had been a little hard</p>\n<p>on Aunt Emma. She wasn't a nice cuddly person like</p>\n<p>Mother, but after all it was she who had thought</p>\n<p>of packing up the odds and ends of things to</p>\n<p>eat.</p>",
        "<p>It was Aunt Emma, too, who had aired all the</p>\n<p>sheets ready; and the men who had moved the furniture</p>\n<p>had put the bedsteads together, so the beds were soon</p>\n<p>made.</p>\n<p>“Good night, chickies,” said Mother. “I'm sure there aren't any</p>\n<p>rats. But I'll leave my door open, and then if</p>\n<p>a mouse comes, you need only scream, and I'll come</p>",
        "<p>and tell it exactly what I think of it.”</p>\n<p>Then she went to her own room. Roberta woke to</p>\n<p>hear the little travelling clock chime two. It sounded like</p>\n<p>a church clock ever so far away, she always thought.</p>\n<p>And she heard, too, Mother still moving about in her</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>Next morning Roberta woke Phyllis by pulling her hair gently,</p>",
        "<p>but quite enough for her purpose.</p>\n<p>“Wassermarrer?” asked Phyllis, still almost wholly asleep.</p>\n<p>“Wake up! wake up!” said Roberta. “We're in the new</p>\n<p>house--don't you remember? No servants or anything. Let's get up</p>\n<p>and begin to be useful. We'll just creep down mouse-quietly,</p>\n<p>and have everything beautiful before Mother gets up. I've woke</p>\n<p>Peter. He'll be dressed as soon as we are.”</p>",
        "<p>So they dressed quietly and quickly. Of course, there was</p>\n<p>no water in their room, so when they got down</p>\n<p>they washed as much as they thought was necessary under</p>\n<p>the spout of the pump in the yard. One pumped</p>\n<p>and the other washed. It was splashy but interesting.</p>\n<p>“It's much more fun than basin washing,” said Roberta. “How</p>\n<p>sparkly the weeds are between the stones, and the moss</p>",
        "<p>on the roof--oh, and the flowers!”</p>\n<p>The roof of the back kitchen sloped down quite low.</p>\n<p>It was made of thatch and it had moss on</p>\n<p>it, and house-leeks and stonecrop and wallflowers, and even a</p>\n<p>clump of purple flag-flowers, at the far corner.</p>\n<p>“This is far, far, far and away prettier than Edgecombe</p>\n<p>Villa,” said Phyllis. “I wonder what the garden's like.”</p>",
        "<p>“We mustn't think of the garden yet,” said Roberta, with</p>\n<p>earnest energy. “Let's go in and begin to work.”</p>\n<p>They lighted the fire and put the kettle on, and</p>\n<p>they arranged the crockery for breakfast; they could not find</p>\n<p>all the right things, but a glass ash-tray made an</p>\n<p>excellent salt-cellar, and a newish baking-tin seemed as if it</p>\n<p>would do to put bread on, if they had any.</p>",
        "<p>When there seemed to be nothing more that they could</p>\n<p>do, they went out again into the fresh bright morning.</p>\n<p>“We'll go into the garden now,” said Peter. But somehow</p>\n<p>they couldn't find the garden. They went round the house</p>\n<p>and round the house. The yard occupied the back, and</p>\n<p>across it were stables and outbuildings. On the other three</p>\n<p>sides the house stood simply in a field, without a</p>",
        "<p>yard of garden to divide it from the short smooth</p>\n<p>turf. And yet they had certainly seen the garden wall</p>\n<p>the night before.</p>\n<p>It was a hilly country. Down below they could see</p>\n<p>the line of the railway, and the black yawning mouth</p>\n<p>of a tunnel. The station was out of sight. There</p>\n<p>was a great bridge with tall arches running across one</p>",
        "<p>end of the valley.</p>\n<p>“Never mind the garden,” said Peter; “let's go down and</p>\n<p>look at the railway. There might be trains passing.”</p>\n<p>“We can see them from here,” said Roberta, slowly; “let's</p>\n<p>sit down a bit.”</p>\n<p>So they all sat down on a great flat grey</p>\n<p>stone that had pushed itself up out of the grass;</p>",
        "<p>it was one of many that lay about on the</p>\n<p>hillside, and when Mother came out to look for them</p>\n<p>at eight o'clock, she found them deeply asleep in a</p>\n<p>contented, sun-warmed bunch.</p>\n<p>They had made an excellent fire, and had set the</p>\n<p>kettle on it at about half-past five. So that by</p>\n<p>eight the fire had been out for some time, the</p>",
        "<p>water had all boiled away, and the bottom was burned</p>\n<p>out of the kettle. Also they had not thought of</p>\n<p>washing the crockery before they set the table.</p>\n<p>“But it doesn't matter--the cups and saucers, I mean,” said</p>\n<p>Mother. “Because I've found another room--I'd quite forgotten there was</p>\n<p>one. And it's magic! And I've boiled the water for</p>\n<p>tea in a saucepan.”</p>",
        "<p>The forgotten room opened out of the kitchen. In the</p>\n<p>agitation and half darkness the night before its door had</p>\n<p>been mistaken for a cupboard's. It was a little square</p>\n<p>room, and on its table, all nicely set out, was</p>\n<p>a joint of cold roast beef, with bread, butter, cheese,</p>\n<p>and a pie.</p>\n<p>“Pie for breakfast!” cried Peter; “how perfectly ripping!”</p>",
        "<p>“It isn't pigeon-pie,” said Mother; “it's only apple. Well, this</p>\n<p>is the supper we ought to have had last night.</p>\n<p>And there was a note from Mrs. Viney. Her son-in-law</p>\n<p>has broken his arm, and she had to get home</p>\n<p>early. She's coming this morning at ten.”</p>\n<p>That was a wonderful breakfast. It is unusual to begin</p>\n<p>the day with cold apple pie, but the children all</p>",
        "<p>said they would rather have it than meat.</p>\n<p>“You see it's more like dinner than breakfast to us,”</p>\n<p>said Peter, passing his plate for more, “because we were</p>\n<p>up so early.”</p>\n<p>The day passed in helping Mother to unpack and arrange</p>\n<p>things. Six small legs quite ached with running about while</p>\n<p>their owners carried clothes and crockery and all sorts of</p>",
        "<p>things to their proper places. It was not till quite</p>\n<p>late in the afternoon that Mother said:--</p>\n<p>“There! That'll do for to-day. I'll lie down for an</p>\n<p>hour, so as to be as fresh as a lark</p>\n<p>by supper-time.”</p>\n<p>Then they all looked at each other. Each of the</p>\n<p>three expressive countenances expressed the same thought. That thought was</p>",
        "<p>double, and consisted, like the bits of information in the</p>\n<p>Child's Guide to Knowledge, of a question and an answer.</p>\n<p>Q. Where shall we go?</p>\n<p>A. To the railway.</p>\n<p>So to the railway they went, and as soon as</p>\n<p>they started for the railway they saw where the garden</p>\n<p>had hidden itself. It was right behind the stables, and</p>",
        "<p>it had a high wall all round.</p>\n<p>“Oh, never mind about the garden now!” cried Peter. “Mother</p>\n<p>told me this morning where it was. It'll keep till</p>\n<p>to-morrow. Let's get to the railway.”</p>\n<p>The way to the railway was all down hill over</p>\n<p>smooth, short turf with here and there furze bushes and</p>\n<p>grey and yellow rocks sticking out like candied peel from</p>",
        "<p>the top of a cake.</p>\n<p>The way ended in a steep run and a wooden</p>\n<p>fence--and there was the railway with the shining metals and</p>\n<p>the telegraph wires and posts and signals.</p>\n<p>They all climbed on to the top of the fence,</p>\n<p>and then suddenly there was a rumbling sound that made</p>\n<p>them look along the line to the right, where the</p>",
        "<p>dark mouth of a tunnel opened itself in the face</p>\n<p>of a rocky cliff; next moment a train had rushed</p>\n<p>out of the tunnel with a shriek and a snort,</p>\n<p>and had slid noisily past them. They felt the rush</p>\n<p>of its passing, and the pebbles on the line jumped</p>\n<p>and rattled under it as it went by.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” said Roberta, drawing a long breath; “it was like</p>",
        "<p>a great dragon tearing by. Did you feel it fan</p>\n<p>us with its hot wings?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose a dragon's lair might look very like that</p>\n<p>tunnel from the outside,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>But Peter said:--</p>\n<p>“I never thought we should ever get as near to</p>\n<p>a train as this. It's the most ripping sport!”</p>",
        "<p>“Better than toy-engines, isn't it?” said Roberta.</p>\n<p>(I am tired of calling Roberta by her name. I</p>\n<p>don't see why I should. No one else did. Everyone</p>\n<p>else called her Bobbie, and I don't see why I</p>\n<p>shouldn't.)</p>\n<p>“I don't know; it's different,” said Peter. “It seems so</p>\n<p>odd to see ALL of a train. It's awfully tall,</p>",
        "<p>isn't it?”</p>\n<p>“We've always seen them cut in half by platforms,” said</p>\n<p>Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if that train was going to London,” Bobbie</p>\n<p>said. “London's where Father is.”</p>\n<p>“Let's go down to the station and find out,” said</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>",
        "<p>So they went.</p>\n<p>They walked along the edge of the line, and heard</p>\n<p>the telegraph wires humming over their heads. When you are</p>\n<p>in the train, it seems such a little way between</p>\n<p>post and post, and one after another the posts seem</p>\n<p>to catch up the wires almost more quickly than you</p>\n<p>can count them. But when you have to walk, the</p>",
        "<p>posts seem few and far between.</p>\n<p>But the children got to the station at last.</p>\n<p>Never before had any of them been at a station,</p>\n<p>except for the purpose of catching trains--or perhaps waiting for</p>\n<p>them--and always with grown-ups in attendance, grown-ups who were not</p>\n<p>themselves interested in stations, except as places from which they</p>\n<p>wished to get away.</p>",
        "<p>Never before had they passed close enough to a signal-box</p>\n<p>to be able to notice the wires, and to hear</p>\n<p>the mysterious 'ping, ping,' followed by the strong, firm clicking</p>\n<p>of machinery.</p>\n<p>The very sleepers on which the rails lay were a</p>\n<p>delightful path to travel by--just far enough apart to serve</p>\n<p>as the stepping-stones in a game of foaming torrents hastily</p>",
        "<p>organised by Bobbie.</p>\n<p>Then to arrive at the station, not through the booking</p>\n<p>office, but in a freebooting sort of way by the</p>\n<p>sloping end of the platform. This in itself was joy.</p>\n<p>Joy, too, it was to peep into the porters' room,</p>\n<p>where the lamps are, and the Railway almanac on the</p>\n<p>wall, and one porter half asleep behind a paper.</p>",
        "<p>There were a great many crossing lines at the station;</p>\n<p>some of them just ran into a yard and stopped</p>\n<p>short, as though they were tired of business and meant</p>\n<p>to retire for good. Trucks stood on the rails here,</p>\n<p>and on one side was a great heap of coal--not</p>\n<p>a loose heap, such as you see in your coal</p>\n<p>cellar, but a sort of solid building of coals with</p>",
        "<p>large square blocks of coal outside used just as though</p>\n<p>they were bricks, and built up till the heap looked</p>\n<p>like the picture of the Cities of the Plain in</p>\n<p>'Bible Stories for Infants.' There was a line of whitewash</p>\n<p>near the top of the coaly wall.</p>\n<p>When presently the Porter lounged out of his room at</p>\n<p>the twice-repeated tingling thrill of a gong over the station</p>",
        "<p>door, Peter said, “How do you do?” in his best</p>\n<p>manner, and hastened to ask what the white mark was</p>\n<p>on the coal for.</p>\n<p>“To mark how much coal there be,” said the Porter,</p>\n<p>“so as we'll know if anyone nicks it. So don't</p>\n<p>you go off with none in your pockets, young gentleman!”</p>\n<p>This seemed, at the time but a merry jest, and</p>",
        "<p>Peter felt at once that the Porter was a friendly</p>\n<p>sort with no nonsense about him. But later the words</p>\n<p>came back to Peter with a new meaning.</p>\n<p>Have you ever gone into a farmhouse kitchen on a</p>\n<p>baking day, and seen the great crock of dough set</p>\n<p>by the fire to rise? If you have, and if</p>\n<p>you were at that time still young enough to be</p>",
        "<p>interested in everything you saw, you will remember that you</p>\n<p>found yourself quite unable to resist the temptation to poke</p>\n<p>your finger into the soft round of dough that curved</p>\n<p>inside the pan like a giant mushroom. And you will</p>\n<p>remember that your finger made a dent in the dough,</p>\n<p>and that slowly, but quite surely, the dent disappeared, and</p>\n<p>the dough looked quite the same as it did before</p>",
        "<p>you touched it. Unless, of course, your hand was extra</p>\n<p>dirty, in which case, naturally, there would be a little</p>\n<p>black mark.</p>\n<p>Well, it was just like that with the sorrow the</p>\n<p>children had felt at Father's going away, and at Mother's</p>\n<p>being so unhappy. It made a deep impression, but the</p>\n<p>impression did not last long.</p>",
        "<p>They soon got used to being without Father, though they</p>\n<p>did not forget him; and they got used to not</p>\n<p>going to school, and to seeing very little of Mother,</p>\n<p>who was now almost all day shut up in her</p>\n<p>upstairs room writing, writing, writing. She used to come down</p>\n<p>at tea-time and read aloud the stories she had written.</p>\n<p>They were lovely stories.</p>",
        "<p>The rocks and hills and valleys and trees, the canal,</p>\n<p>and above all, the railway, were so new and so</p>\n<p>perfectly pleasing that the remembrance of the old life in</p>\n<p>the villa grew to seem almost like a dream.</p>\n<p>Mother had told them more than once that they were</p>\n<p>'quite poor now,' but this did not seem to be</p>\n<p>anything but a way of speaking. Grown-up people, even Mothers,</p>",
        "<p>often make remarks that don't seem to mean anything in</p>\n<p>particular, just for the sake of saying something, seemingly. There</p>\n<p>was always enough to eat, and they wore the same</p>\n<p>kind of nice clothes they had always worn.</p>\n<p>But in June came three wet days; the rain came</p>\n<p>down, straight as lances, and it was very, very cold.</p>\n<p>Nobody could go out, and everybody shivered. They all went</p>",
        "<p>up to the door of Mother's room and knocked.</p>\n<p>“Well, what is it?” asked Mother from inside.</p>\n<p>“Mother,” said Bobbie, “mayn't I light a fire? I do</p>\n<p>know how.”</p>\n<p>And Mother said: “No, my ducky-love. We mustn't have fires</p>\n<p>in June--coal is so dear. If you're cold, go and</p>\n<p>have a good romp in the attic. That'll warm you.”</p>",
        "<p>“But, Mother, it only takes such a very little coal</p>\n<p>to make a fire.”</p>\n<p>“It's more than we can afford, chickeny-love,” said Mother, cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Now run away, there's darlings--I'm madly busy!”</p>\n<p>“Mother's always busy now,” said Phyllis, in a whisper to</p>\n<p>Peter. Peter did not answer. He shrugged his shoulders. He</p>\n<p>was thinking.</p>",
        "<p>Thought, however, could not long keep itself from the suitable</p>\n<p>furnishing of a bandit's lair in the attic. Peter was</p>\n<p>the bandit, of course. Bobbie was his lieutenant, his band</p>\n<p>of trusty robbers, and, in due course, the parent of</p>\n<p>Phyllis, who was the captured maiden for whom a magnificent</p>\n<p>ransom--in horse-beans--was unhesitatingly paid.</p>\n<p>They all went down to tea flushed and joyous as</p>",
        "<p>any mountain brigands.</p>\n<p>But when Phyllis was going to add jam to her</p>\n<p>bread and butter, Mother said:--</p>\n<p>“Jam OR butter, dear--not jam AND butter. We can't afford</p>\n<p>that sort of reckless luxury nowadays.”</p>\n<p>Phyllis finished the slice of bread and butter in silence,</p>\n<p>and followed it up by bread and jam. Peter mingled</p>",
        "<p>thought and weak tea.</p>\n<p>After tea they went back to the attic and he</p>\n<p>said to his sisters:--</p>\n<p>“I have an idea.”</p>\n<p>“What's that?” they asked politely.</p>\n<p>“I shan't tell you,” was Peter's unexpected rejoinder.</p>\n<p>“Oh, very well,” said Bobbie; and Phil said, “Don't, then.”</p>",
        "<p>“Girls,” said Peter, “are always so hasty tempered.”</p>\n<p>“I should like to know what boys are?” said Bobbie,</p>\n<p>with fine disdain. “I don't want to know about your</p>\n<p>silly ideas.”</p>\n<p>“You'll know some day,” said Peter, keeping his own temper</p>\n<p>by what looked exactly like a miracle; “if you hadn't</p>\n<p>been so keen on a row, I might have told</p>",
        "<p>you about it being only noble-heartedness that made me not</p>\n<p>tell you my idea. But now I shan't tell you</p>\n<p>anything at all about it--so there!”</p>\n<p>And it was, indeed, some time before he could be</p>\n<p>induced to say anything, and when he did it wasn't</p>\n<p>much. He said:--</p>\n<p>“The only reason why I won't tell you my idea</p>",
        "<p>that I'm going to do is because it MAY be</p>\n<p>wrong, and I don't want to drag you into it.”</p>\n<p>“Don't you do it if it's wrong, Peter,” said Bobbie;</p>\n<p>“let me do it.” But Phyllis said:--</p>\n<p>“_I_ should like to do wrong if YOU'RE going to!”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Peter, rather touched by this devotion; “it's a</p>\n<p>forlorn hope, and I'm going to lead it. All I</p>",
        "<p>ask is that if Mother asks where I am, you</p>\n<p>won't blab.”</p>\n<p>“We haven't got anything TO blab,” said Bobbie, indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, you have!” said Peter, dropping horse-beans through his</p>\n<p>fingers. “I've trusted you to the death. You know I'm</p>\n<p>going to do a lone adventure--and some people might think</p>\n<p>it wrong--I don't. And if Mother asks where I am,</p>",
        "<p>say I'm playing at mines.”</p>\n<p>“What sort of mines?”</p>\n<p>“You just say mines.”</p>\n<p>“You might tell US, Pete.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then, COAL-mines. But don't you let the word pass</p>\n<p>your lips on pain of torture.”</p>\n<p>“You needn't threaten,” said Bobbie, “and I do think you</p>",
        "<p>might let us help.”</p>\n<p>“If I find a coal-mine, you shall help cart the</p>\n<p>coal,” Peter condescended to promise.</p>\n<p>“Keep your secret if you like,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Keep it if you CAN,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“I'll keep it, right enough,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>Between tea and supper there is an interval even in</p>",
        "<p>the most greedily regulated families. At this time Mother was</p>\n<p>usually writing, and Mrs. Viney had gone home.</p>\n<p>Two nights after the dawning of Peter's idea he beckoned</p>\n<p>the girls mysteriously at the twilight hour.</p>\n<p>“Come hither with me,” he said, “and bring the Roman</p>\n<p>Chariot.”</p>\n<p>The Roman Chariot was a very old perambulator that had</p>",
        "<p>spent years of retirement in the loft over the coach-house.</p>\n<p>The children had oiled its works till it glided noiseless</p>\n<p>as a pneumatic bicycle, and answered to the helm as</p>\n<p>it had probably done in its best days.</p>\n<p>“Follow your dauntless leader,” said Peter, and led the way</p>\n<p>down the hill towards the station.</p>\n<p>Just above the station many rocks have pushed their heads</p>",
        "<p>out through the turf as though they, like the children,</p>\n<p>were interested in the railway.</p>\n<p>In a little hollow between three rocks lay a heap</p>\n<p>of dried brambles and heather.</p>\n<p>Peter halted, turned over the brushwood with a well-scarred boot,</p>\n<p>and said:--</p>\n<p>“Here's the first coal from the St. Peter's Mine. We'll</p>",
        "<p>take it home in the chariot. Punctuality and despatch. All</p>\n<p>orders carefully attended to. Any shaped lump cut to suit</p>\n<p>regular customers.”</p>\n<p>The chariot was packed full of coal. And when it</p>\n<p>was packed it had to be unpacked again because it</p>\n<p>was so heavy that it couldn't be got up the</p>\n<p>hill by the three children, not even when Peter harnessed</p>",
        "<p>himself to the handle with his braces, and firmly grasping</p>\n<p>his waistband in one hand pulled while the girls pushed</p>\n<p>behind.</p>\n<p>Three journeys had to be made before the coal from</p>\n<p>Peter's mine was added to the heap of Mother's coal</p>\n<p>in the cellar.</p>\n<p>Afterwards Peter went out alone, and came back very black</p>",
        "<p>and mysterious.</p>\n<p>“I've been to my coal-mine,” he said; “to-morrow evening we'll</p>\n<p>bring home the black diamonds in the chariot.”</p>\n<p>It was a week later that Mrs. Viney remarked to</p>\n<p>Mother how well this last lot of coal was holding</p>\n<p>out.</p>\n<p>The children hugged themselves and each other in complicated wriggles</p>",
        "<p>of silent laughter as they listened on the stairs. They</p>\n<p>had all forgotten by now that there had ever been</p>\n<p>any doubt in Peter's mind as to whether coal-mining was</p>\n<p>wrong.</p>\n<p>But there came a dreadful night when the Station Master</p>\n<p>put on a pair of old sand shoes that he</p>\n<p>had worn at the seaside in his summer holiday, and</p>",
        "<p>crept out very quietly to the yard where the Sodom</p>\n<p>and Gomorrah heap of coal was, with the whitewashed line</p>\n<p>round it. He crept out there, and he waited like</p>\n<p>a cat by a mousehole. On the top of the</p>\n<p>heap something small and dark was scrabbling and rattling furtively</p>\n<p>among the coal.</p>\n<p>The Station Master concealed himself in the shadow of a</p>",
        "<p>brake-van that had a little tin chimney and was labelled:--</p>\n<p>G. N. and S. R. 34576 Return at once to</p>\n<p>White Heather Sidings</p>\n<p>and in this concealment he lurked till the small thing</p>\n<p>on the top of the heap ceased to scrabble and</p>\n<p>rattle, came to the edge of the heap, cautiously let</p>\n<p>itself down, and lifted something after it. Then the arm</p>",
        "<p>of the Station Master was raised, the hand of the</p>\n<p>Station Master fell on a collar, and there was Peter</p>\n<p>firmly held by the jacket, with an old carpenter's bag</p>\n<p>full of coal in his trembling clutch.</p>\n<p>“So I've caught you at last, have I, you young</p>\n<p>thief?” said the Station Master.</p>\n<p>“I'm not a thief,” said Peter, as firmly as he</p>",
        "<p>could. “I'm a coal-miner.”</p>\n<p>“Tell that to the Marines,” said the Station Master.</p>\n<p>“It would be just as true whoever I told it</p>\n<p>to,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“You're right there,” said the man, who held him. “Stow</p>\n<p>your jaw, you young rip, and come along to the</p>\n<p>station.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, no,” cried in the darkness an agonised voice that</p>\n<p>was not Peter's.</p>\n<p>“Not the POLICE station!” said another voice from the darkness.</p>\n<p>“Not yet,” said the Station Master. “The Railway Station first.</p>\n<p>Why, it's a regular gang. Any more of you?”</p>\n<p>“Only us,” said Bobbie and Phyllis, coming out of the</p>\n<p>shadow of another truck labelled Staveley Colliery, and bearing on</p>",
        "<p>it the legend in white chalk: 'Wanted in No. 1</p>\n<p>Road.'</p>\n<p>“What do you mean by spying on a fellow like</p>\n<p>this?” said Peter, angrily.</p>\n<p>“Time someone did spy on you, _I_ think,” said the</p>\n<p>Station Master. “Come along to the station.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, DON'T!” said Bobbie. “Can't you decide NOW what you'll</p>",
        "<p>do to us? It's our fault just as much as</p>\n<p>Peter's. We helped to carry the coal away--and we knew</p>\n<p>where he got it.”</p>\n<p>“No, you didn't,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Yes, we did,” said Bobbie. “We knew all the time.</p>\n<p>We only pretended we didn't just to humour you.”</p>\n<p>Peter's cup was full. He had mined for coal, he</p>",
        "<p>had struck coal, he had been caught, and now he</p>\n<p>learned that his sisters had 'humoured' him.</p>\n<p>“Don't hold me!” he said. “I won't run away.”</p>\n<p>The Station Master loosed Peter's collar, struck a match and</p>\n<p>looked at them by its flickering light.</p>\n<p>“Why,” said he, “you're the children from the Three Chimneys</p>\n<p>up yonder. So nicely dressed, too. Tell me now, what</p>",
        "<p>made you do such a thing? Haven't you ever been</p>\n<p>to church or learned your catechism or anything, not to</p>\n<p>know it's wicked to steal?” He spoke much more gently</p>\n<p>now, and Peter said:--</p>\n<p>“I didn't think it was stealing. I was almost sure</p>\n<p>it wasn't. I thought if I took it from the</p>\n<p>outside part of the heap, perhaps it would be. But</p>",
        "<p>in the middle I thought I could fairly count it</p>\n<p>only mining. It'll take thousands of years for you to</p>\n<p>burn up all that coal and get to the middle</p>\n<p>parts.”</p>\n<p>“Not quite. But did you do it for a lark</p>\n<p>or what?”</p>\n<p>“Not much lark carting that beastly heavy stuff up the</p>",
        "<p>hill,” said Peter, indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Then why did you?” The Station Master's voice was so</p>\n<p>much kinder now that Peter replied:--</p>\n<p>“You know that wet day? Well, Mother said we were</p>\n<p>too poor to have a fire. We always had fires</p>\n<p>when it was cold at our other house, and--”</p>\n<p>“DON'T!” interrupted Bobbie, in a whisper.</p>",
        "<p>“Well,” said the Station Master, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, “I'll</p>\n<p>tell you what I'll do. I'll look over it this</p>\n<p>once. But you remember, young gentleman, stealing is stealing, and</p>\n<p>what's mine isn't yours, whether you call it mining or</p>\n<p>whether you don't. Run along home.”</p>\n<p>“Do you mean you aren't going to do anything to</p>\n<p>us? Well, you are a brick,” said Peter, with enthusiasm.</p>",
        "<p>“You're a dear,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“You're a darling,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“That's all right,” said the Station Master.</p>\n<p>And on this they parted.</p>\n<p>“Don't speak to me,” said Peter, as the three went</p>\n<p>up the hill. “You're spies and traitors--that's what you are.”</p>\n<p>But the girls were too glad to have Peter between</p>",
        "<p>them, safe and free, and on the way to Three</p>\n<p>Chimneys and not to the Police Station, to mind much</p>\n<p>what he said.</p>\n<p>“We DID say it was us as much as you,”</p>\n<p>said Bobbie, gently.</p>\n<p>“Well--and it wasn't.”</p>\n<p>“It would have come to the same thing in Courts</p>",
        "<p>with judges,” said Phyllis. “Don't be snarky, Peter. It isn't</p>\n<p>our fault your secrets are so jolly easy to find</p>\n<p>out.” She took his arm, and he let her.</p>\n<p>“There's an awful lot of coal in the cellar, anyhow,”</p>\n<p>he went on.</p>\n<p>“Oh, don't!” said Bobbie. “I don't think we ought to</p>\n<p>be glad about THAT.”</p>",
        "<p>“I don't know,” said Peter, plucking up a spirit. “I'm</p>\n<p>not at all sure, even now, that mining is a</p>\n<p>crime.”</p>\n<p>But the girls were quite sure. And they were also</p>\n<p>quite sure that he was quite sure, however little he</p>\n<p>cared to own it.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter III.</h3>\n<p>The old gentleman.</p>\n<p>After the adventure of Peter's Coal-mine, it seemed well to</p>\n<p>the children to keep away from the station--but they did</p>\n<p>not, they could not, keep away from the railway. They</p>\n<p>had lived all their lives in a street where cabs</p>\n<p>and omnibuses rumbled by at all hours, and the carts</p>\n<p>of butchers and bakers and candlestick makers (I never saw</p>",
        "<p>a candlestick-maker's cart; did you?) might occur at any moment.</p>\n<p>Here in the deep silence of the sleeping country the</p>\n<p>only things that went by were the trains. They seemed</p>\n<p>to be all that was left to link the children</p>\n<p>to the old life that had once been theirs. Straight</p>\n<p>down the hill in front of Three Chimneys the daily</p>\n<p>passage of their six feet began to mark a path</p>",
        "<p>across the crisp, short turf. They began to know the</p>\n<p>hours when certain trains passed, and they gave names to</p>\n<p>them. The 9.15 up was called the Green Dragon. The</p>\n<p>10.7 down was the Worm of Wantley. The midnight town</p>\n<p>express, whose shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their dreams</p>\n<p>to hear, was the Fearsome Fly-by-night. Peter got up once,</p>\n<p>in chill starshine, and, peeping at it through his curtains,</p>",
        "<p>named it on the spot.</p>\n<p>It was by the Green Dragon that the old gentleman</p>\n<p>travelled. He was a very nice-looking old gentleman, and he</p>\n<p>looked as if he were nice, too, which is not</p>\n<p>at all the same thing. He had a fresh-coloured, clean-shaven</p>\n<p>face and white hair, and he wore rather odd-shaped collars</p>\n<p>and a top-hat that wasn't exactly the same kind as</p>",
        "<p>other people's. Of course the children didn't see all this</p>\n<p>at first. In fact the first thing they noticed about</p>\n<p>the old gentleman was his hand.</p>\n<p>It was one morning as they sat on the fence</p>\n<p>waiting for the Green Dragon, which was three and a</p>\n<p>quarter minutes late by Peter's Waterbury watch that he had</p>\n<p>had given him on his last birthday.</p>",
        "<p>“The Green Dragon's going where Father is,” said Phyllis; “if</p>\n<p>it were a really real dragon, we could stop it</p>\n<p>and ask it to take our love to Father.”</p>\n<p>“Dragons don't carry people's love,” said Peter; “they'd be above</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, they do, if you tame them thoroughly first. They</p>\n<p>fetch and carry like pet spaniels,” said Phyllis, “and feed</p>",
        "<p>out of your hand. I wonder why Father never writes</p>\n<p>to us.”</p>\n<p>“Mother says he's been too busy,” said Bobbie; “but he'll</p>\n<p>write soon, she says.”</p>\n<p>“I say,” Phyllis suggested, “let's all wave to the Green</p>\n<p>Dragon as it goes by. If it's a magic dragon,</p>\n<p>it'll understand and take our loves to Father. And if</p>",
        "<p>it isn't, three waves aren't much. We shall never miss</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>So when the Green Dragon tore shrieking out of the</p>\n<p>mouth of its dark lair, which was the tunnel, all</p>\n<p>three children stood on the railing and waved their pocket-handkerchiefs</p>\n<p>without stopping to think whether they were clean handkerchiefs or</p>\n<p>the reverse. They were, as a matter of fact, very</p>",
        "<p>much the reverse.</p>\n<p>And out of a first-class carriage a hand waved back.</p>\n<p>A quite clean hand. It held a newspaper. It was</p>\n<p>the old gentleman's hand.</p>\n<p>After this it became the custom for waves to be</p>\n<p>exchanged between the children and the 9.15.</p>\n<p>And the children, especially the girls, liked to think that</p>",
        "<p>perhaps the old gentleman knew Father, and would meet him</p>\n<p>'in business,' wherever that shady retreat might be, and tell</p>\n<p>him how his three children stood on a rail far</p>\n<p>away in the green country and waved their love to</p>\n<p>him every morning, wet or fine.</p>\n<p>For they were now able to go out in all</p>\n<p>sorts of weather such as they would never have been</p>",
        "<p>allowed to go out in when they lived in their</p>\n<p>villa house. This was Aunt Emma's doing, and the children</p>\n<p>felt more and more that they had not been quite</p>\n<p>fair to this unattractive aunt, when they found how useful</p>\n<p>were the long gaiters and waterproof coats that they had</p>\n<p>laughed at her for buying for them.</p>\n<p>Mother, all this time, was very busy with her writing.</p>",
        "<p>She used to send off a good many long blue</p>\n<p>envelopes with stories in them--and large envelopes of different sizes</p>\n<p>and colours used to come to her. Sometimes she would</p>\n<p>sigh when she opened them and say:--</p>\n<p>“Another story come home to roost. Oh, dear, Oh, dear!”</p>\n<p>and then the children would be very sorry.</p>\n<p>But sometimes she would wave the envelope in the air</p>",
        "<p>and say:--“Hooray, hooray. Here's a sensible Editor. He's taken my</p>\n<p>story and this is the proof of it.”</p>\n<p>At first the children thought 'the Proof' meant the letter</p>\n<p>the sensible Editor had written, but they presently got to</p>\n<p>know that the proof was long slips of paper with</p>\n<p>the story printed on them.</p>\n<p>Whenever an Editor was sensible there were buns for tea.</p>",
        "<p>One day Peter was going down to the village to</p>\n<p>get buns to celebrate the sensibleness of the Editor of</p>\n<p>the Children's Globe, when he met the Station Master.</p>\n<p>Peter felt very uncomfortable, for he had now had time</p>\n<p>to think over the affair of the coal-mine. He did</p>\n<p>not like to say “Good morning” to the Station Master,</p>\n<p>as you usually do to anyone you meet on a</p>",
        "<p>lonely road, because he had a hot feeling, which spread</p>\n<p>even to his ears, that the Station Master might not</p>\n<p>care to speak to a person who had stolen coals.</p>\n<p>'Stolen' is a nasty word, but Peter felt it was</p>\n<p>the right one. So he looked down, and said Nothing.</p>\n<p>It was the Station Master who said “Good morning” as</p>\n<p>he passed by. And Peter answered, “Good morning.” Then he</p>",
        "<p>thought:--</p>\n<p>“Perhaps he doesn't know who I am by daylight, or</p>\n<p>he wouldn't be so polite.”</p>\n<p>And he did not like the feeling which thinking this</p>\n<p>gave him. And then before he knew what he was</p>\n<p>going to do he ran after the Station Master, who</p>\n<p>stopped when he heard Peter's hasty boots crunching the road,</p>",
        "<p>and coming up with him very breathless and with his</p>\n<p>ears now quite magenta-coloured, he said:--</p>\n<p>“I don't want you to be polite to me if</p>\n<p>you don't know me when you see me.”</p>\n<p>“Eh?” said the Station Master.</p>\n<p>“I thought perhaps you didn't know it was me that</p>\n<p>took the coals,” Peter went on, “when you said 'Good</p>",
        "<p>morning.' But it was, and I'm sorry. There.”</p>\n<p>“Why,” said the Station Master, “I wasn't thinking anything at</p>\n<p>all about the precious coals. Let bygones be bygones. And</p>\n<p>where were you off to in such a hurry?”</p>\n<p>“I'm going to buy buns for tea,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“I thought you were all so poor,” said the Station</p>\n<p>Master.</p>",
        "<p>“So we are,” said Peter, confidentially, “but we always have</p>\n<p>three pennyworth of halfpennies for tea whenever Mother sells a</p>\n<p>story or a poem or anything.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said the Station Master, “so your Mother writes stories,</p>\n<p>does she?”</p>\n<p>“The beautifulest you ever read,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“You ought to be very proud to have such a</p>",
        "<p>clever Mother.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Peter, “but she used to play with us</p>\n<p>more before she had to be so clever.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the Station Master, “I must be getting along.</p>\n<p>You give us a look in at the Station whenever</p>\n<p>you feel so inclined. And as to coals, it's a</p>\n<p>word that--well--oh, no, we never mention it, eh?”</p>",
        "<p>“Thank you,” said Peter. “I'm very glad it's all straightened</p>\n<p>out between us.” And he went on across the canal</p>\n<p>bridge to the village to get the buns, feeling more</p>\n<p>comfortable in his mind than he had felt since the</p>\n<p>hand of the Station Master had fastened on his collar</p>\n<p>that night among the coals.</p>\n<p>Next day when they had sent the threefold wave of</p>",
        "<p>greeting to Father by the Green Dragon, and the old</p>\n<p>gentleman had waved back as usual, Peter proudly led the</p>\n<p>way to the station.</p>\n<p>“But ought we?” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“After the coals, she means,” Phyllis explained.</p>\n<p>“I met the Station Master yesterday,” said Peter, in an</p>\n<p>offhand way, and he pretended not to hear what Phyllis</p>",
        "<p>had said; “he expresspecially invited us to go down any</p>\n<p>time we liked.”</p>\n<p>“After the coals?” repeated Phyllis. “Stop a minute--my bootlace is</p>\n<p>undone again.”</p>\n<p>“It always IS undone again,” said Peter, “and the Station</p>\n<p>Master was more of a gentleman than you'll ever be,</p>\n<p>Phil--throwing coal at a chap's head like that.”</p>",
        "<p>Phyllis did up her bootlace and went on in silence,</p>\n<p>but her shoulders shook, and presently a fat tear fell</p>\n<p>off her nose and splashed on the metal of the</p>\n<p>railway line. Bobbie saw it.</p>\n<p>“Why, what's the matter, darling?” she said, stopping short and</p>\n<p>putting her arm round the heaving shoulders.</p>\n<p>“He called me un-un-ungentlemanly,” sobbed Phyllis. “I didn't never call</p>",
        "<p>him unladylike, not even when he tied my Clorinda to</p>\n<p>the firewood bundle and burned her at the stake for</p>\n<p>a martyr.”</p>\n<p>Peter had indeed perpetrated this outrage a year or two</p>\n<p>before.</p>\n<p>“Well, you began, you know,” said Bobbie, honestly, “about coals</p>\n<p>and all that. Don't you think you'd better both unsay</p>",
        "<p>everything since the wave, and let honour be satisfied?”</p>\n<p>“I will if Peter will,” said Phyllis, sniffling.</p>\n<p>“All right,” said Peter; “honour is satisfied. Here, use my</p>\n<p>hankie, Phil, for goodness' sake, if you've lost yours as</p>\n<p>usual. I wonder what you do with them.”</p>\n<p>“You had my last one,” said Phyllis, indignantly, “to tie</p>\n<p>up the rabbit-hutch door with. But you're very ungrateful. It's</p>",
        "<p>quite right what it says in the poetry book about</p>\n<p>sharper than a serpent it is to have a toothless</p>\n<p>child--but it means ungrateful when it says toothless. Miss Lowe</p>\n<p>told me so.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said Peter, impatiently, “I'm sorry. THERE! Now will</p>\n<p>you come on?”</p>\n<p>They reached the station and spent a joyous two hours</p>",
        "<p>with the Porter. He was a worthy man and seemed</p>\n<p>never tired of answering the questions that begin with “Why--”</p>\n<p>which many people in higher ranks of life often seem</p>\n<p>weary of.</p>\n<p>He told them many things that they had not known</p>\n<p>before--as, for instance, that the things that hook carriages together</p>\n<p>are called couplings, and that the pipes like great serpents</p>",
        "<p>that hang over the couplings are meant to stop the</p>\n<p>train with.</p>\n<p>“If you could get a holt of one o' them</p>\n<p>when the train is going and pull 'em apart,” said</p>\n<p>he, “she'd stop dead off with a jerk.”</p>\n<p>“Who's she?” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“The train, of course,” said the Porter. After that the</p>",
        "<p>train was never again 'It' to the children.</p>\n<p>“And you know the thing in the carriages where it</p>\n<p>says on it, 'Five pounds' fine for improper use.' If</p>\n<p>you was to improperly use that, the train 'ud stop.”</p>\n<p>“And if you used it properly?” said Roberta.</p>\n<p>“It 'ud stop just the same, I suppose,” said he,</p>\n<p>“but it isn't proper use unless you're being murdered. There</p>",
        "<p>was an old lady once--someone kidded her on it was</p>\n<p>a refreshment-room bell, and she used it improper, not being</p>\n<p>in danger of her life, though hungry, and when the</p>\n<p>train stopped and the guard came along expecting to find</p>\n<p>someone weltering in their last moments, she says, 'Oh, please,</p>\n<p>Mister, I'll take a glass of stout and a bath</p>\n<p>bun,' she says. And the train was seven minutes behind</p>",
        "<p>her time as it was.”</p>\n<p>“What did the guard say to the old lady?”</p>\n<p>“_I_ dunno,” replied the Porter, “but I lay she didn't</p>\n<p>forget it in a hurry, whatever it was.”</p>\n<p>In such delightful conversation the time went by all too</p>\n<p>quickly.</p>\n<p>The Station Master came out once or twice from that</p>",
        "<p>sacred inner temple behind the place where the hole is</p>\n<p>that they sell you tickets through, and was most jolly</p>\n<p>with them all.</p>\n<p>“Just as if coal had never been discovered,” Phyllis whispered</p>\n<p>to her sister.</p>\n<p>He gave them each an orange, and promised to take</p>\n<p>them up into the signal-box one of these days, when</p>",
        "<p>he wasn't so busy.</p>\n<p>Several trains went through the station, and Peter noticed for</p>\n<p>the first time that engines have numbers on them, like</p>\n<p>cabs.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the Porter, “I knowed a young gent as</p>\n<p>used to take down the numbers of every single one</p>\n<p>he seed; in a green note-book with silver corners it</p>",
        "<p>was, owing to his father being very well-to-do in the</p>\n<p>wholesale stationery.”</p>\n<p>Peter felt that he could take down numbers, too, even</p>\n<p>if he was not the son of a wholesale stationer.</p>\n<p>As he did not happen to have a green leather</p>\n<p>note-book with silver corners, the Porter gave him a yellow</p>\n<p>envelope and on it he noted:--</p>",
        "<p>379 663</p>\n<p>and felt that this was the beginning of what would</p>\n<p>be a most interesting collection.</p>\n<p>That night at tea he asked Mother if she had</p>\n<p>a green leather note-book with silver corners. She had not;</p>\n<p>but when she heard what he wanted it for she</p>\n<p>gave him a little black one.</p>",
        "<p>“It has a few pages torn out,” said she; “but</p>\n<p>it will hold quite a lot of numbers, and when</p>\n<p>it's full I'll give you another. I'm so glad you</p>\n<p>like the railway. Only, please, you mustn't walk on the</p>\n<p>line.”</p>\n<p>“Not if we face the way the train's coming?” asked</p>\n<p>Peter, after a gloomy pause, in which glances of despair</p>",
        "<p>were exchanged.</p>\n<p>“No--really not,” said Mother.</p>\n<p>Then Phyllis said, “Mother, didn't YOU ever walk on the</p>\n<p>railway lines when you were little?”</p>\n<p>Mother was an honest and honourable Mother, so she had</p>\n<p>to say, “Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” said Phyllis.</p>",
        "<p>“But, darlings, you don't know how fond I am of</p>\n<p>you. What should I do if you got hurt?”</p>\n<p>“Are you fonder of us than Granny was of you</p>\n<p>when you were little?” Phyllis asked. Bobbie made signs to</p>\n<p>her to stop, but Phyllis never did see signs, no</p>\n<p>matter how plain they might be.</p>\n<p>Mother did not answer for a minute. She got up</p>",
        "<p>to put more water in the teapot.</p>\n<p>“No one,” she said at last, “ever loved anyone more</p>\n<p>than my mother loved me.”</p>\n<p>Then she was quiet again, and Bobbie kicked Phyllis hard</p>\n<p>under the table, because Bobbie understood a little bit the</p>\n<p>thoughts that were making Mother so quiet--the thoughts of the</p>\n<p>time when Mother was a little girl and was all</p>",
        "<p>the world to HER mother. It seems so easy and</p>\n<p>natural to run to Mother when one is in trouble.</p>\n<p>Bobbie understood a little how people do not leave off</p>\n<p>running to their mothers when they are in trouble even</p>\n<p>when they are grown up, and she thought she knew</p>\n<p>a little what it must be to be sad, and</p>\n<p>have no mother to run to any more.</p>",
        "<p>So she kicked Phyllis, who said:--</p>\n<p>“What are you kicking me like that for, Bob?”</p>\n<p>And then Mother laughed a little and sighed and said:--</p>\n<p>“Very well, then. Only let me be sure you do</p>\n<p>know which way the trains come--and don't walk on the</p>\n<p>line near the tunnel or near corners.”</p>\n<p>“Trains keep to the left like carriages,” said Peter, “so</p>",
        "<p>if we keep to the right, we're bound to see</p>\n<p>them coming.”</p>\n<p>“Very well,” said Mother, and I dare say you think</p>\n<p>that she ought not to have said it. But she</p>\n<p>remembered about when she was a little girl herself, and</p>\n<p>she did say it--and neither her own children nor you</p>\n<p>nor any other children in the world could ever understand</p>",
        "<p>exactly what it cost her to do it. Only some</p>\n<p>few of you, like Bobbie, may understand a very little</p>\n<p>bit.</p>\n<p>It was the very next day that Mother had to</p>\n<p>stay in bed because her head ached so. Her hands</p>\n<p>were burning hot, and she would not eat anything, and</p>\n<p>her throat was very sore.</p>",
        "<p>“If I was you, Mum,” said Mrs. Viney, “I should</p>\n<p>take and send for the doctor. There's a lot of</p>\n<p>catchy complaints a-going about just now. My sister's eldest--she took</p>\n<p>a chill and it went to her inside, two years</p>\n<p>ago come Christmas, and she's never been the same gell</p>\n<p>since.”</p>\n<p>Mother wouldn't at first, but in the evening she felt</p>",
        "<p>so much worse that Peter was sent to the house</p>\n<p>in the village that had three laburnum trees by the</p>\n<p>gate, and on the gate a brass plate with W.</p>\n<p>W. Forrest, M.D., on it.</p>\n<p>W. W. Forrest, M.D., came at once. He talked to</p>\n<p>Peter on the way back. He seemed a most charming</p>\n<p>and sensible man, interested in railways, and rabbits, and really</p>",
        "<p>important things.</p>\n<p>When he had seen Mother, he said it was influenza.</p>\n<p>“Now, Lady Grave-airs,” he said in the hall to Bobbie,</p>\n<p>“I suppose you'll want to be head-nurse.”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” said she.</p>\n<p>“Well, then, I'll send down some medicine. Keep up a</p>\n<p>good fire. Have some strong beef tea made ready to</p>",
        "<p>give her as soon as the fever goes down. She</p>\n<p>can have grapes now, and beef essence--and soda-water and milk,</p>\n<p>and you'd better get in a bottle of brandy. The</p>\n<p>best brandy. Cheap brandy is worse than poison.”</p>\n<p>She asked him to write it all down, and he</p>\n<p>did.</p>\n<p>When Bobbie showed Mother the list he had written, Mother</p>",
        "<p>laughed. It WAS a laugh, Bobbie decided, though it was</p>\n<p>rather odd and feeble.</p>\n<p>“Nonsense,” said Mother, laying in bed with eyes as bright</p>\n<p>as beads. “I can't afford all that rubbish. Tell Mrs.</p>\n<p>Viney to boil two pounds of scrag-end of the neck</p>\n<p>for your dinners to-morrow, and I can have some of</p>\n<p>the broth. Yes, I should like some more water now,</p>",
        "<p>love. And will you get a basin and sponge my</p>\n<p>hands?”</p>\n<p>Roberta obeyed. When she had done everything she could to</p>\n<p>make Mother less uncomfortable, she went down to the others.</p>\n<p>Her cheeks were very red, her lips set tight, and</p>\n<p>her eyes almost as bright as Mother's.</p>\n<p>She told them what the Doctor had said, and what</p>",
        "<p>Mother had said.</p>\n<p>“And now,” said she, when she had told all, “there's</p>\n<p>no one but us to do anything, and we've got</p>\n<p>to do it. I've got the shilling for the mutton.”</p>\n<p>“We can do without the beastly mutton,” said Peter; “bread</p>\n<p>and butter will support life. People have lived on less</p>\n<p>on desert islands many a time.”</p>",
        "<p>“Of course,” said his sister. And Mrs. Viney was sent</p>\n<p>to the village to get as much brandy and soda-water</p>\n<p>and beef tea as she could buy for a shilling.</p>\n<p>“But even if we never have anything to eat at</p>\n<p>all,” said Phyllis, “you can't get all those other things</p>\n<p>with our dinner money.”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Bobbie, frowning, “we must find out some other</p>",
        "<p>way. Now THINK, everybody, just as hard as ever you</p>\n<p>can.”</p>\n<p>They did think. And presently they talked. And later, when</p>\n<p>Bobbie had gone up to sit with Mother in case</p>\n<p>she wanted anything, the other two were very busy with</p>\n<p>scissors and a white sheet, and a paint brush, and</p>\n<p>the pot of Brunswick black that Mrs. Viney used for</p>",
        "<p>grates and fenders. They did not manage to do what</p>\n<p>they wished, exactly, with the first sheet, so they took</p>\n<p>another out of the linen cupboard. It did not occur</p>\n<p>to them that they were spoiling good sheets which cost</p>\n<p>good money. They only knew that they were making a</p>\n<p>good--but what they were making comes later.</p>\n<p>Bobbie's bed had been moved into Mother's room, and several</p>",
        "<p>times in the night she got up to mend the</p>\n<p>fire, and to give her mother milk and soda-water. Mother</p>\n<p>talked to herself a good deal, but it did not</p>\n<p>seem to mean anything. And once she woke up suddenly</p>\n<p>and called out: “Mamma, mamma!” and Bobbie knew she was</p>\n<p>calling for Granny, and that she had forgotten that it</p>\n<p>was no use calling, because Granny was dead.</p>",
        "<p>In the early morning Bobbie heard her name and jumped</p>\n<p>out of bed and ran to Mother's bedside.</p>\n<p>“Oh--ah, yes--I think I was asleep,” said Mother. “My poor</p>\n<p>little duck, how tired you'll be--I do hate to give</p>\n<p>you all this trouble.”</p>\n<p>“Trouble!” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Ah, don't cry, sweet,” Mother said; “I shall be all</p>",
        "<p>right in a day or two.”</p>\n<p>And Bobbie said, “Yes,” and tried to smile.</p>\n<p>When you are used to ten hours of solid sleep,</p>\n<p>to get up three or four times in your sleep-time</p>\n<p>makes you feel as though you had been up all</p>\n<p>night. Bobbie felt quite stupid and her eyes were sore</p>\n<p>and stiff, but she tidied the room, and arranged everything</p>",
        "<p>neatly before the Doctor came.</p>\n<p>This was at half-past eight.</p>\n<p>“Everything going on all right, little Nurse?” he said at</p>\n<p>the front door. “Did you get the brandy?”</p>\n<p>“I've got the brandy,” said Bobbie, “in a little flat</p>\n<p>bottle.”</p>\n<p>“I didn't see the grapes or the beef tea, though,”</p>",
        "<p>said he.</p>\n<p>“No,” said Bobbie, firmly, “but you will to-morrow. And there's</p>\n<p>some beef stewing in the oven for beef tea.”</p>\n<p>“Who told you to do that?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I noticed what Mother did when Phil had mumps.”</p>\n<p>“Right,” said the Doctor. “Now you get your old woman</p>\n<p>to sit with your mother, and then you eat a</p>",
        "<p>good breakfast, and go straight to bed and sleep till</p>\n<p>dinner-time. We can't afford to have the head-nurse ill.”</p>\n<p>He was really quite a nice doctor.</p>\n<p>When the 9.15 came out of the tunnel that morning</p>\n<p>the old gentleman in the first-class carriage put down his</p>\n<p>newspaper, and got ready to wave his hand to the</p>\n<p>three children on the fence. But this morning there were</p>",
        "<p>not three. There was only one. And that was Peter.</p>\n<p>Peter was not on the railings either, as usual. He</p>\n<p>was standing in front of them in an attitude like</p>\n<p>that of a show-man showing off the animals in a</p>\n<p>menagerie, or of the kind clergyman when he points with</p>\n<p>a wand at the 'Scenes from Palestine,' when there is</p>\n<p>a magic-lantern and he is explaining it.</p>",
        "<p>Peter was pointing, too. And what he was pointing at</p>\n<p>was a large white sheet nailed against the fence. On</p>\n<p>the sheet there were thick black letters more than a</p>\n<p>foot long.</p>\n<p>Some of them had run a little, because of Phyllis</p>\n<p>having put the Brunswick black on too eagerly, but the</p>\n<p>words were quite easy to read.</p>",
        "<p>And this what the old gentleman and several other people</p>\n<p>in the train read in the large black letters on</p>\n<p>the white sheet:--</p>\n<p>LOOK OUT AT THE STATION.</p>\n<p>A good many people did look out at the station</p>\n<p>and were disappointed, for they saw nothing unusual. The old</p>\n<p>gentleman looked out, too, and at first he too saw</p>",
        "<p>nothing more unusual than the gravelled platform and the sunshine</p>\n<p>and the wallflowers and forget-me-nots in the station borders. It</p>\n<p>was only just as the train was beginning to puff</p>\n<p>and pull itself together to start again that he saw</p>\n<p>Phyllis. She was quite out of breath with running.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” she said, “I thought I'd missed you. My bootlaces</p>\n<p>would keep coming down and I fell over them twice.</p>",
        "<p>Here, take it.”</p>\n<p>She thrust a warm, dampish letter into his hand as</p>\n<p>the train moved.</p>\n<p>He leaned back in his corner and opened the letter.</p>\n<p>This is what he read:--</p>\n<p>“Dear Mr. We do not know your name.</p>\n<p>Mother is ill and the doctor says to give her</p>",
        "<p>the things at the end of the letter, but she</p>\n<p>says she can't aford it, and to get mutton for</p>\n<p>us and she will have the broth. We do not</p>\n<p>know anybody here but you, because Father is away and</p>\n<p>we do not know the address. Father will pay you,</p>\n<p>or if he has lost all his money, or anything,</p>\n<p>Peter will pay you when he is a man. We</p>",
        "<p>promise it on our honer. I.O.U. for all the things</p>\n<p>Mother wants.</p>\n<p>“sined Peter.</p>\n<p>“Will you give the parsel to the Station Master, because</p>\n<p>of us not knowing what train you come down by?</p>\n<p>Say it is for Peter that was sorry about the</p>\n<p>coals and he will know all right.</p>",
        "<p>“Roberta. “Phyllis. “Peter.”</p>\n<p>Then came the list of things the Doctor had ordered.</p>\n<p>The old gentleman read it through once, and his eyebrows</p>\n<p>went up. He read it twice and smiled a little.</p>\n<p>When he had read it thrice, he put it in</p>\n<p>his pocket and went on reading The Times.</p>\n<p>At about six that evening there was a knock at</p>",
        "<p>the back door. The three children rushed to open it,</p>\n<p>and there stood the friendly Porter, who had told them</p>\n<p>so many interesting things about railways. He dumped down a</p>\n<p>big hamper on the kitchen flags.</p>\n<p>“Old gent,” he said; “he asked me to fetch it</p>\n<p>up straight away.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you very much,” said Peter, and then, as the</p>",
        "<p>Porter lingered, he added:--</p>\n<p>“I'm most awfully sorry I haven't got twopence to give</p>\n<p>you like Father does, but--”</p>\n<p>“You drop it if you please,” said the Porter, indignantly.</p>\n<p>“I wasn't thinking about no tuppences. I only wanted to</p>\n<p>say I was sorry your Mamma wasn't so well, and</p>\n<p>to ask how she finds herself this evening--and I've fetched</p>",
        "<p>her along a bit of sweetbrier, very sweet to smell</p>\n<p>it is. Twopence indeed,” said he, and produced a bunch</p>\n<p>of sweetbrier from his hat, “just like a conjurer,” as</p>\n<p>Phyllis remarked afterwards.</p>\n<p>“Thank you very much,” said Peter, “and I beg your</p>\n<p>pardon about the twopence.”</p>\n<p>“No offence,” said the Porter, untruly but politely, and went.</p>",
        "<p>Then the children undid the hamper. First there was straw,</p>\n<p>and then there were fine shavings, and then came all</p>\n<p>the things they had asked for, and plenty of them,</p>\n<p>and then a good many things they had not asked</p>\n<p>for; among others peaches and port wine and two chickens,</p>\n<p>a cardboard box of big red roses with long stalks,</p>\n<p>and a tall thin green bottle of lavender water, and</p>",
        "<p>three smaller fatter bottles of eau-de-Cologne. There was a letter,</p>\n<p>too.</p>\n<p>“Dear Roberta and Phyllis and Peter,” it said; “here are</p>\n<p>the things you want. Your mother will want to know</p>\n<p>where they came from. Tell her they were sent by</p>\n<p>a friend who heard she was ill. When she is</p>\n<p>well again you must tell her all about it, of</p>",
        "<p>course. And if she says you ought not to have</p>\n<p>asked for the things, tell her that I say you</p>\n<p>were quite right, and that I hope she will forgive</p>\n<p>me for taking the liberty of allowing myself a very</p>\n<p>great pleasure.”</p>\n<p>The letter was signed G. P. something that the children</p>\n<p>couldn't read.</p>",
        "<p>“I think we WERE right,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Right? Of course we were right,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“All the same,” said Peter, with his hands in his</p>\n<p>pockets, “I don't exactly look forward to telling Mother the</p>\n<p>whole truth about it.”</p>\n<p>“We're not to do it till she's well,” said Bobbie,</p>\n<p>“and when she's well we shall be so happy we</p>",
        "<p>shan't mind a little fuss like that. Oh, just look</p>\n<p>at the roses! I must take them up to her.”</p>\n<p>“And the sweetbrier,” said Phyllis, sniffing it loudly; “don't forget</p>\n<p>the sweetbrier.”</p>\n<p>“As if I should!” said Roberta. “Mother told me the</p>\n<p>other day there was a thick hedge of it at</p>\n<p>her mother's house when she was a little girl.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter IV.</h3>\n<p>The engine-burglar.</p>\n<p>What was left of the second sheet and the Brunswick</p>\n<p>black came in very nicely to make a banner bearing</p>\n<p>the legend</p>\n<p>SHE IS NEARLY WELL THANK YOU</p>\n<p>and this was displayed to the Green Dragon about a</p>\n<p>fortnight after the arrival of the wonderful hamper. The old</p>",
        "<p>gentleman saw it, and waved a cheerful response from the</p>\n<p>train. And when this had been done the children saw</p>\n<p>that now was the time when they must tell Mother</p>\n<p>what they had done when she was ill. And it</p>\n<p>did not seem nearly so easy as they had thought</p>\n<p>it would be. But it had to be done. And</p>\n<p>it was done. Mother was extremely angry. She was seldom</p>",
        "<p>angry, and now she was angrier than they had ever</p>\n<p>known her. This was horrible. But it was much worse</p>\n<p>when she suddenly began to cry. Crying is catching, I</p>\n<p>believe, like measles and whooping-cough. At any rate, everyone at</p>\n<p>once found itself taking part in a crying-party.</p>\n<p>Mother stopped first. She dried her eyes and then she</p>\n<p>said:--</p>",
        "<p>“I'm sorry I was so angry, darlings, because I know</p>\n<p>you didn't understand.”</p>\n<p>“We didn't mean to be naughty, Mammy,” sobbed Bobbie, and</p>\n<p>Peter and Phyllis sniffed.</p>\n<p>“Now, listen,” said Mother; “it's quite true that we're poor,</p>\n<p>but we have enough to live on. You mustn't go</p>\n<p>telling everyone about our affairs--it's not right. And you must</p>",
        "<p>never, never, never ask strangers to give you things. Now</p>\n<p>always remember that--won't you?”</p>\n<p>They all hugged her and rubbed their damp cheeks against</p>\n<p>hers and promised that they would.</p>\n<p>“And I'll write a letter to your old gentleman, and</p>\n<p>I shall tell him that I didn't approve--oh, of course</p>\n<p>I shall thank him, too, for his kindness. It's YOU</p>",
        "<p>I don't approve of, my darlings, not the old gentleman.</p>\n<p>He was as kind as ever he could be. And</p>\n<p>you can give the letter to the Station Master to</p>\n<p>give him--and we won't say any more about it.”</p>\n<p>Afterwards, when the children were alone, Bobbie said:--</p>\n<p>“Isn't Mother splendid? You catch any other grown-up saying they</p>\n<p>were sorry they had been angry.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” said Peter, “she IS splendid; but it's rather awful</p>\n<p>when she's angry.”</p>\n<p>“She's like Avenging and Bright in the song,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“I should like to look at her if it wasn't</p>\n<p>so awful. She looks so beautiful when she's really downright</p>\n<p>furious.”</p>\n<p>They took the letter down to the Station Master.</p>",
        "<p>“I thought you said you hadn't got any friends except</p>\n<p>in London,” said he.</p>\n<p>“We've made him since,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“But he doesn't live hereabouts?”</p>\n<p>“No--we just know him on the railway.”</p>\n<p>Then the Station Master retired to that sacred inner temple</p>\n<p>behind the little window where the tickets are sold, and</p>",
        "<p>the children went down to the Porters' room and talked</p>\n<p>to the Porter. They learned several interesting things from him--among</p>\n<p>others that his name was Perks, that he was married</p>\n<p>and had three children, that the lamps in front of</p>\n<p>engines are called head-lights and the ones at the back</p>\n<p>tail-lights.</p>\n<p>“And that just shows,” whispered Phyllis, “that trains really ARE</p>",
        "<p>dragons in disguise, with proper heads and tails.”</p>\n<p>It was on this day that the children first noticed</p>\n<p>that all engines are not alike.</p>\n<p>“Alike?” said the Porter, whose name was Perks, “lor, love</p>\n<p>you, no, Miss. No more alike nor what you an'</p>\n<p>me are. That little 'un without a tender as went</p>\n<p>by just now all on her own, that was a</p>",
        "<p>tank, that was--she's off to do some shunting t'other side</p>\n<p>o' Maidbridge. That's as it might be you, Miss. Then</p>\n<p>there's goods engines, great, strong things with three wheels each</p>\n<p>side--joined with rods to strengthen 'em--as it might be me.</p>\n<p>Then there's main-line engines as it might be this 'ere</p>\n<p>young gentleman when he grows up and wins all the</p>\n<p>races at 'is school--so he will. The main-line engine she's</p>",
        "<p>built for speed as well as power. That's one to</p>\n<p>the 9.15 up.”</p>\n<p>“The Green Dragon,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“We calls her the Snail, Miss, among ourselves,” said the</p>\n<p>Porter. “She's oftener be'ind'and nor any train on the line.”</p>\n<p>“But the engine's green,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Yes, Miss,” said Perks, “so's a snail some seasons o'</p>",
        "<p>the year.”</p>\n<p>The children agreed as they went home to dinner that</p>\n<p>the Porter was most delightful company.</p>\n<p>Next day was Roberta's birthday. In the afternoon she was</p>\n<p>politely but firmly requested to get out of the way</p>\n<p>and keep there till tea-time.</p>\n<p>“You aren't to see what we're going to do till</p>",
        "<p>it's done; it's a glorious surprise,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>And Roberta went out into the garden all alone. She</p>\n<p>tried to be grateful, but she felt she would much</p>\n<p>rather have helped in whatever it was than have to</p>\n<p>spend her birthday afternoon by herself, no matter how glorious</p>\n<p>the surprise might be.</p>\n<p>Now that she was alone, she had time to think,</p>",
        "<p>and one of the things she thought of most was</p>\n<p>what mother had said in one of those feverish nights</p>\n<p>when her hands were so hot and her eyes so</p>\n<p>bright.</p>\n<p>The words were: “Oh, what a doctor's bill there'll be</p>\n<p>for this!”</p>\n<p>She walked round and round the garden among the rose-bushes</p>",
        "<p>that hadn't any roses yet, only buds, and the lilac</p>\n<p>bushes and syringas and American currants, and the more she</p>\n<p>thought of the doctor's bill, the less she liked the</p>\n<p>thought of it.</p>\n<p>And presently she made up her mind. She went out</p>\n<p>through the side door of the garden and climbed up</p>\n<p>the steep field to where the road runs along by</p>",
        "<p>the canal. She walked along until she came to the</p>\n<p>bridge that crosses the canal and leads to the village,</p>\n<p>and here she waited. It was very pleasant in the</p>\n<p>sunshine to lean one's elbows on the warm stone of</p>\n<p>the bridge and look down at the blue water of</p>\n<p>the canal. Bobbie had never seen any other canal, except</p>\n<p>the Regent's Canal, and the water of that is not</p>",
        "<p>at all a pretty colour. And she had never seen</p>\n<p>any river at all except the Thames, which also would</p>\n<p>be all the better if its face was washed.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the children would have loved the canal as much</p>\n<p>as the railway, but for two things. One was that</p>\n<p>they had found the railway FIRST--on that first, wonderful morning</p>\n<p>when the house and the country and the moors and</p>",
        "<p>rocks and great hills were all new to them. They</p>\n<p>had not found the canal till some days later. The</p>\n<p>other reason was that everyone on the railway had been</p>\n<p>kind to them--the Station Master, the Porter, and the old</p>\n<p>gentleman who waved. And the people on the canal were</p>\n<p>anything but kind.</p>\n<p>The people on the canal were, of course, the bargees,</p>",
        "<p>who steered the slow barges up and down, or walked</p>\n<p>beside the old horses that trampled up the mud of</p>\n<p>the towing-path, and strained at the long tow-ropes.</p>\n<p>Peter had once asked one of the bargees the time,</p>\n<p>and had been told to “get out of that,” in</p>\n<p>a tone so fierce that he did not stop to</p>\n<p>say anything about his having just as much right on</p>",
        "<p>the towing-path as the man himself. Indeed, he did not</p>\n<p>even think of saying it till some time later.</p>\n<p>Then another day when the children thought they would like</p>\n<p>to fish in the canal, a boy in a barge</p>\n<p>threw lumps of coal at them, and one of these</p>\n<p>hit Phyllis on the back of the neck. She was</p>\n<p>just stooping down to tie up her bootlace--and though the</p>",
        "<p>coal hardly hurt at all it made her not care</p>\n<p>very much about going on fishing.</p>\n<p>On the bridge, however, Roberta felt quite safe, because she</p>\n<p>could look down on the canal, and if any boy</p>\n<p>showed signs of meaning to throw coal, she could duck</p>\n<p>behind the parapet.</p>\n<p>Presently there was a sound of wheels, which was just</p>",
        "<p>what she expected.</p>\n<p>The wheels were the wheels of the Doctor's dogcart, and</p>\n<p>in the cart, of course, was the Doctor.</p>\n<p>He pulled up, and called out:--</p>\n<p>“Hullo, head nurse! Want a lift?”</p>\n<p>“I wanted to see you,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Your mother's not worse, I hope?” said the Doctor.</p>",
        "<p>“No--but--”</p>\n<p>“Well, skip in, then, and we'll go for a drive.”</p>\n<p>Roberta climbed in and the brown horse was made to</p>\n<p>turn round--which it did not like at all, for it</p>\n<p>was looking forward to its tea--I mean its oats.</p>\n<p>“This IS jolly,” said Bobbie, as the dogcart flew along</p>\n<p>the road by the canal.</p>",
        "<p>“We could throw a stone down any one of your</p>\n<p>three chimneys,” said the Doctor, as they passed the house.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie, “but you'd have to be a jolly</p>\n<p>good shot.”</p>\n<p>“How do you know I'm not?” said the Doctor. “Now,</p>\n<p>then, what's the trouble?”</p>\n<p>Bobbie fidgeted with the hook of the driving apron.</p>",
        "<p>“Come, out with it,” said the Doctor.</p>\n<p>“It's rather hard, you see,” said Bobbie, “to out with</p>\n<p>it; because of what Mother said.”</p>\n<p>“What DID Mother say?”</p>\n<p>“She said I wasn't to go telling everyone that we're</p>\n<p>poor. But you aren't everyone, are you?”</p>\n<p>“Not at all,” said the Doctor, cheerfully. “Well?”</p>",
        "<p>“Well, I know doctors are very extravagant--I mean expensive, and</p>\n<p>Mrs. Viney told me that her doctoring only cost her</p>\n<p>twopence a week because she belonged to a Club.”</p>\n<p>“Yes?”</p>\n<p>“You see she told me what a good doctor you</p>\n<p>were, and I asked her how she could afford you,</p>\n<p>because she's much poorer than we are. I've been in</p>",
        "<p>her house and I know. And then she told me</p>\n<p>about the Club, and I thought I'd ask you--and--oh, I</p>\n<p>don't want Mother to be worried! Can't we be in</p>\n<p>the Club, too, the same as Mrs. Viney?”</p>\n<p>The Doctor was silent. He was rather poor himself, and</p>\n<p>he had been pleased at getting a new family to</p>\n<p>attend. So I think his feelings at that minute were</p>",
        "<p>rather mixed.</p>\n<p>“You aren't cross with me, are you?” said Bobbie, in</p>\n<p>a very small voice.</p>\n<p>The Doctor roused himself.</p>\n<p>“Cross? How could I be? You're a very sensible little</p>\n<p>woman. Now look here, don't you worry. I'll make it</p>\n<p>all right with your Mother, even if I have to</p>",
        "<p>make a special brand-new Club all for her. Look here,</p>\n<p>this is where the Aqueduct begins.”</p>\n<p>“What's an Aque--what's its name?” asked Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“A water bridge,” said the Doctor. “Look.”</p>\n<p>The road rose to a bridge over the canal. To</p>\n<p>the left was a steep rocky cliff with trees and</p>\n<p>shrubs growing in the cracks of the rock. And the</p>",
        "<p>canal here left off running along the top of the</p>\n<p>hill and started to run on a bridge of its</p>\n<p>own--a great bridge with tall arches that went right across</p>\n<p>the valley.</p>\n<p>Bobbie drew a long breath.</p>\n<p>“It IS grand, isn't it?” she said. “It's like pictures</p>\n<p>in the History of Rome.”</p>",
        "<p>“Right!” said the Doctor, “that's just exactly what it IS</p>\n<p>like. The Romans were dead nuts on aqueducts. It's a</p>\n<p>splendid piece of engineering.”</p>\n<p>“I thought engineering was making engines.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, there are different sorts of engineering--making road and bridges</p>\n<p>and tunnels is one kind. And making fortifications is another.</p>\n<p>Well, we must be turning back. And, remember, you aren't</p>",
        "<p>to worry about doctor's bills or you'll be ill yourself,</p>\n<p>and then I'll send you in a bill as long</p>\n<p>as the aqueduct.”</p>\n<p>When Bobbie had parted from the Doctor at the top</p>\n<p>of the field that ran down from the road to</p>\n<p>Three Chimneys, she could not feel that she had done</p>\n<p>wrong. She knew that Mother would perhaps think differently. But</p>",
        "<p>Bobbie felt that for once she was the one who</p>\n<p>was right, and she scrambled down the rocky slope with</p>\n<p>a really happy feeling.</p>\n<p>Phyllis and Peter met her at the back door. They</p>\n<p>were unnaturally clean and neat, and Phyllis had a red</p>\n<p>bow in her hair. There was only just time for</p>\n<p>Bobbie to make herself tidy and tie up her hair</p>",
        "<p>with a blue bow before a little bell rang.</p>\n<p>“There!” said Phyllis, “that's to show the surprise is ready.</p>\n<p>Now you wait till the bell rings again and then</p>\n<p>you may come into the dining-room.”</p>\n<p>So Bobbie waited.</p>\n<p>“Tinkle, tinkle,” said the little bell, and Bobbie went into</p>\n<p>the dining-room, feeling rather shy. Directly she opened the door</p>",
        "<p>she found herself, as it seemed, in a new world</p>\n<p>of light and flowers and singing. Mother and Peter and</p>\n<p>Phyllis were standing in a row at the end of</p>\n<p>the table. The shutters were shut and there were twelve</p>\n<p>candles on the table, one for each of Roberta's years.</p>\n<p>The table was covered with a sort of pattern of</p>\n<p>flowers, and at Roberta's place was a thick wreath of</p>",
        "<p>forget-me-nots and several most interesting little packages. And Mother and</p>\n<p>Phyllis and Peter were singing--to the first part of the</p>\n<p>tune of St. Patrick's Day. Roberta knew that Mother had</p>\n<p>written the words on purpose for her birthday. It was</p>\n<p>a little way of Mother's on birthdays. It had begun</p>\n<p>on Bobbie's fourth birthday when Phyllis was a baby. Bobbie</p>\n<p>remembered learning the verses to say to Father 'for a</p>",
        "<p>surprise.' She wondered if Mother had remembered, too. The four-year-old</p>\n<p>verse had been:--</p>\n<p>Daddy dear, I'm only four And I'd rather not be</p>\n<p>more. Four's the nicest age to be, Two and two</p>\n<p>and one and three. What I love is two and</p>\n<p>two, Mother, Peter, Phil, and you. What you love is</p>\n<p>one and three, Mother, Peter, Phil, and me. Give your</p>",
        "<p>little girl a kiss Because she learned and told you</p>\n<p>this.</p>\n<p>The song the others were singing now went like this:--</p>\n<p>Our darling Roberta, No sorrow shall hurt her If we</p>\n<p>can prevent it Her whole life long. Her birthday's our</p>\n<p>fete day, We'll make it our great day, And give</p>\n<p>her our presents And sing her our song. May pleasures</p>",
        "<p>attend her And may the Fates send her The happiest</p>\n<p>journey Along her life's way. With skies bright above her</p>\n<p>And dear ones to love her! Dear Bob! Many happy</p>\n<p>Returns of the day!</p>\n<p>When they had finished singing they cried, “Three cheers for</p>\n<p>our Bobbie!” and gave them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly</p>\n<p>as though she were going to cry--you know that odd</p>",
        "<p>feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking</p>\n<p>in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin</p>\n<p>they were all kissing and hugging her.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”</p>\n<p>They were very nice presents. There was a green and</p>\n<p>red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments.</p>\n<p>There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped</p>",
        "<p>like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for</p>\n<p>years, but which she had never, never thought would come</p>\n<p>to be her very own. There was also a pair</p>\n<p>of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen</p>\n<p>and admired them in the village shop. And there were</p>\n<p>three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.</p>\n<p>Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head.</p>",
        "<p>“And now look at the table,” she said.</p>\n<p>There was a cake on the table covered with white</p>\n<p>sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and</p>\n<p>there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was</p>\n<p>that the big table was almost covered with flowers--wallflowers were</p>\n<p>laid all round the tea-tray--there was a ring of forget-me-nots</p>\n<p>round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white</p>",
        "<p>lilac round it, and in the middle was something that</p>\n<p>looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of</p>\n<p>lilac or wallflower or laburnum.</p>\n<p>“It's a map--a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look--those</p>\n<p>lilac lines are the metals--and there's the station done in</p>\n<p>brown wallflowers. The laburnum is the train, and there are</p>\n<p>the signal-boxes, and the road up to here--and those fat</p>",
        "<p>red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman--that's</p>\n<p>him, the pansy in the laburnum train.”</p>\n<p>“And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said</p>\n<p>Phyllis. “And that little tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out</p>\n<p>for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it</p>\n<p>all, and we got all the flowers from the station.</p>\n<p>We thought you'd like it better.”</p>",
        "<p>“That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored</p>\n<p>steam-engine on the table in front of her. Its tender</p>\n<p>had been lined with fresh white paper, and was full</p>\n<p>of sweets.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not</p>\n<p>your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only</p>",
        "<p>the sweets.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little--not so much</p>\n<p>because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as</p>\n<p>because she had thought it so very noble of Peter,</p>\n<p>and now she felt she had been silly to think</p>\n<p>it. Also she felt she must have seemed greedy to</p>\n<p>expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her</p>",
        "<p>face changed. Peter saw it. He hesitated a minute; then</p>\n<p>his face changed, too, and he said: “I mean not</p>\n<p>ALL the engine. I'll let you go halves if you</p>\n<p>like.”</p>\n<p>“You're a brick,” cried Bobbie; “it's a splendid present.” She</p>\n<p>said no more aloud, but to herself she said:--</p>\n<p>“That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know</p>",
        "<p>he didn't mean to. Well, the broken half shall be</p>\n<p>my half of the engine, and I'll get it mended</p>\n<p>and give it back to Peter for his birthday.”--“Yes, Mother</p>\n<p>dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added,</p>\n<p>and tea began.</p>\n<p>It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games</p>\n<p>with them--any game they liked--and of course their first choice</p>",
        "<p>was blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's forget-me-not wreath</p>\n<p>twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed</p>\n<p>there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to</p>\n<p>calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read</p>\n<p>to them.</p>\n<p>“You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie</p>\n<p>asked as they said good night.</p>",
        "<p>And Mother said no, she wouldn't--she would only just write</p>\n<p>to Father and then go to bed.</p>\n<p>But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her</p>\n<p>presents--for she felt she really could not be separated from</p>\n<p>them all night--Mother was not writing, but leaning her head</p>\n<p>on her arms and her arms on the table. I</p>\n<p>think it was rather good of Bobbie to slip quietly</p>",
        "<p>away, saying over and over, “She doesn't want me to</p>\n<p>know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I won't know.”</p>\n<p>But it made a sad end to the birthday.</p>\n<p>* * * * * *</p>\n<p>The very next morning Bobbie began to watch her opportunity</p>\n<p>to get Peter's engine mended secretly. And the opportunity came</p>\n<p>the very next afternoon.</p>",
        "<p>Mother went by train to the nearest town to do</p>\n<p>shopping. When she went there, she always went to the</p>\n<p>Post-office. Perhaps to post her letters to Father, for she</p>\n<p>never gave them to the children or Mrs. Viney to</p>\n<p>post, and she never went to the village herself. Peter</p>\n<p>and Phyllis went with her. Bobbie wanted an excuse not</p>\n<p>to go, but try as she would she couldn't think</p>",
        "<p>of a good one. And just when she felt that</p>\n<p>all was lost, her frock caught on a big nail</p>\n<p>by the kitchen door and there was a great criss-cross</p>\n<p>tear all along the front of the skirt. I assure</p>\n<p>you this was really an accident. So the others pitied</p>\n<p>her and went without her, for there was no time</p>\n<p>for her to change, because they were rather late already</p>",
        "<p>and had to hurry to the station to catch the</p>\n<p>train.</p>\n<p>When they had gone, Bobbie put on her everyday frock,</p>\n<p>and went down to the railway. She did not go</p>\n<p>into the station, but she went along the line to</p>\n<p>the end of the platform where the engine is when</p>\n<p>the down train is alongside the platform--the place where there</p>",
        "<p>are a water tank and a long, limp, leather hose,</p>\n<p>like an elephant's trunk. She hid behind a bush on</p>\n<p>the other side of the railway. She had the toy</p>\n<p>engine done up in brown paper, and she waited patiently</p>\n<p>with it under her arm.</p>\n<p>Then when the next train came in and stopped, Bobbie</p>\n<p>went across the metals of the up-line and stood beside</p>",
        "<p>the engine. She had never been so close to an</p>\n<p>engine before. It looked much larger and harder than she</p>\n<p>had expected, and it made her feel very small indeed,</p>\n<p>and, somehow, very soft--as if she could very, very easily</p>\n<p>be hurt rather badly.</p>\n<p>“I know what silk-worms feel like now,” said Bobbie to</p>\n<p>herself.</p>",
        "<p>The engine-driver and fireman did not see her. They were</p>\n<p>leaning out on the other side, telling the Porter a</p>\n<p>tale about a dog and a leg of mutton.</p>\n<p>“If you please,” said Roberta--but the engine was blowing off</p>\n<p>steam and no one heard her.</p>\n<p>“If you please, Mr. Engineer,” she spoke a little louder,</p>\n<p>but the Engine happened to speak at the same moment,</p>",
        "<p>and of course Roberta's soft little voice hadn't a chance.</p>\n<p>It seemed to her that the only way would be</p>\n<p>to climb on to the engine and pull at their</p>\n<p>coats. The step was high, but she got her knee</p>\n<p>on it, and clambered into the cab; she stumbled and</p>\n<p>fell on hands and knees on the base of the</p>\n<p>great heap of coals that led up to the square</p>",
        "<p>opening in the tender. The engine was not above the</p>\n<p>weaknesses of its fellows; it was making a great deal</p>\n<p>more noise than there was the slightest need for. And</p>\n<p>just as Roberta fell on the coals, the engine-driver, who</p>\n<p>had turned without seeing her, started the engine, and when</p>\n<p>Bobbie had picked herself up, the train was moving--not fast,</p>\n<p>but much too fast for her to get off.</p>",
        "<p>All sorts of dreadful thoughts came to her all together</p>\n<p>in one horrible flash. There were such things as express</p>\n<p>trains that went on, she supposed, for hundreds of miles</p>\n<p>without stopping. Suppose this should be one of them? How</p>\n<p>would she get home again? She had no money to</p>\n<p>pay for the return journey.</p>\n<p>“And I've no business here. I'm an engine-burglar--that's what I</p>",
        "<p>am,” she thought. “I shouldn't wonder if they could lock</p>\n<p>me up for this.” And the train was going faster</p>\n<p>and faster.</p>\n<p>There was something in her throat that made it impossible</p>\n<p>for her to speak. She tried twice. The men had</p>\n<p>their backs to her. They were doing something to things</p>\n<p>that looked like taps.</p>",
        "<p>Suddenly she put out her hand and caught hold of</p>\n<p>the nearest sleeve. The man turned with a start, and</p>\n<p>he and Roberta stood for a minute looking at each</p>\n<p>other in silence. Then the silence was broken by them</p>\n<p>both.</p>\n<p>The man said, “Here's a bloomin' go!” and Roberta burst</p>\n<p>into tears.</p>",
        "<p>The other man said he was blooming well blest--or something</p>\n<p>like it--but though naturally surprised they were not exactly unkind.</p>\n<p>“You're a naughty little gell, that's what you are,” said</p>\n<p>the fireman, and the engine-driver said:--</p>\n<p>“Daring little piece, I call her,” but they made her</p>\n<p>sit down on an iron seat in the cab and</p>\n<p>told her to stop crying and tell them what she</p>",
        "<p>meant by it.</p>\n<p>She did stop, as soon as she could. One thing</p>\n<p>that helped her was the thought that Peter would give</p>\n<p>almost his ears to be in her place--on a real</p>\n<p>engine--really going. The children had often wondered whether any engine-driver</p>\n<p>could be found noble enough to take them for a</p>\n<p>ride on an engine--and now there she was. She dried</p>",
        "<p>her eyes and sniffed earnestly.</p>\n<p>“Now, then,” said the fireman, “out with it. What do</p>\n<p>you mean by it, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, please,” sniffed Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Try again,” said the engine-driver, encouragingly.</p>\n<p>Bobbie tried again.</p>\n<p>“Please, Mr. Engineer,” she said, “I did call out to</p>",
        "<p>you from the line, but you didn't hear me--and I</p>\n<p>just climbed up to touch you on the arm--quite gently</p>\n<p>I meant to do it--and then I fell into the</p>\n<p>coals--and I am so sorry if I frightened you. Oh,</p>\n<p>don't be cross--oh, please don't!” She sniffed again.</p>\n<p>“We ain't so much CROSS,” said the fireman, “as interested</p>\n<p>like. It ain't every day a little gell tumbles into</p>",
        "<p>our coal bunker outer the sky, is it, Bill? What</p>\n<p>did you DO it for--eh?”</p>\n<p>“That's the point,” agreed the engine-driver; “what did you do</p>\n<p>it FOR?”</p>\n<p>Bobbie found that she had not quite stopped crying. The</p>\n<p>engine-driver patted her on the back and said: “Here, cheer</p>\n<p>up, Mate. It ain't so bad as all that 'ere,</p>",
        "<p>I'll be bound.”</p>\n<p>“I wanted,” said Bobbie, much cheered to find herself addressed</p>\n<p>as 'Mate'--“I only wanted to ask you if you'd be</p>\n<p>so kind as to mend this.” She picked up the</p>\n<p>brown-paper parcel from among the coals and undid the string</p>\n<p>with hot, red fingers that trembled.</p>\n<p>Her feet and legs felt the scorch of the engine</p>",
        "<p>fire, but her shoulders felt the wild chill rush of</p>\n<p>the air. The engine lurched and shook and rattled, and</p>\n<p>as they shot under a bridge the engine seemed to</p>\n<p>shout in her ears.</p>\n<p>The fireman shovelled on coals.</p>\n<p>Bobbie unrolled the brown paper and disclosed the toy engine.</p>\n<p>“I thought,” she said wistfully, “that perhaps you'd mend this</p>",
        "<p>for me--because you're an engineer, you know.”</p>\n<p>The engine-driver said he was blowed if he wasn't blest.</p>\n<p>“I'm blest if I ain't blowed,” remarked the fireman.</p>\n<p>But the engine-driver took the little engine and looked at</p>\n<p>it--and the fireman ceased for an instant to shovel coal,</p>\n<p>and looked, too.</p>\n<p>“It's like your precious cheek,” said the engine-driver--“whatever made you</p>",
        "<p>think we'd be bothered tinkering penny toys?”</p>\n<p>“I didn't mean it for precious cheek,” said Bobbie; “only</p>\n<p>everybody that has anything to do with railways is so</p>\n<p>kind and good, I didn't think you'd mind. You don't</p>\n<p>really--do you?” she added, for she had seen a not</p>\n<p>unkindly wink pass between the two.</p>\n<p>“My trade's driving of an engine, not mending her, especially</p>",
        "<p>such a hout-size in engines as this 'ere,” said Bill.</p>\n<p>“An' 'ow are we a-goin' to get you back to</p>\n<p>your sorrowing friends and relations, and all be forgiven and</p>\n<p>forgotten?”</p>\n<p>“If you'll put me down next time you stop,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie, firmly, though her heart beat fiercely against her arm</p>\n<p>as she clasped her hands, “and lend me the money</p>",
        "<p>for a third-class ticket, I'll pay you back--honour bright. I'm</p>\n<p>not a confidence trick like in the newspapers--really, I'm not.”</p>\n<p>“You're a little lady, every inch,” said Bill, relenting suddenly</p>\n<p>and completely. “We'll see you gets home safe. An' about</p>\n<p>this engine--Jim--ain't you got ne'er a pal as can use</p>\n<p>a soldering iron? Seems to me that's about all the</p>\n<p>little bounder wants doing to it.”</p>",
        "<p>“That's what Father said,” Bobbie explained eagerly. “What's that for?”</p>\n<p>She pointed to a little brass wheel that he had</p>\n<p>turned as he spoke.</p>\n<p>“That's the injector.”</p>\n<p>“In--what?”</p>\n<p>“Injector to fill up the boiler.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Bobbie, mentally registering the fact to tell the</p>",
        "<p>others; “that IS interesting.”</p>\n<p>“This 'ere's the automatic brake,” Bill went on, flattered by</p>\n<p>her enthusiasm. “You just move this 'ere little handle--do it</p>\n<p>with one finger, you can--and the train jolly soon stops.</p>\n<p>That's what they call the Power of Science in the</p>\n<p>newspapers.”</p>\n<p>He showed her two little dials, like clock faces, and</p>",
        "<p>told her how one showed how much steam was going,</p>\n<p>and the other showed if the brake was working properly.</p>\n<p>By the time she had seen him shut off steam</p>\n<p>with a big shining steel handle, Bobbie knew more about</p>\n<p>the inside working of an engine than she had ever</p>\n<p>thought there was to know, and Jim had promised that</p>\n<p>his second cousin's wife's brother should solder the toy engine,</p>",
        "<p>or Jim would know the reason why. Besides all the</p>\n<p>knowledge she had gained Bobbie felt that she and Bill</p>\n<p>and Jim were now friends for life, and that they</p>\n<p>had wholly and forever forgiven her for stumbling uninvited among</p>\n<p>the sacred coals of their tender.</p>\n<p>At Stacklepoole Junction she parted from them with warm expressions</p>\n<p>of mutual regard. They handed her over to the guard</p>",
        "<p>of a returning train--a friend of theirs--and she had the</p>\n<p>joy of knowing what guards do in their secret fastnesses,</p>\n<p>and understood how, when you pull the communication cord in</p>\n<p>railway carriages, a wheel goes round under the guard's nose</p>\n<p>and a loud bell rings in his ears. She asked</p>\n<p>the guard why his van smelt so fishy, and learned</p>\n<p>that he had to carry a lot of fish every</p>",
        "<p>day, and that the wetness in the hollows of the</p>\n<p>corrugated floor had all drained out of boxes full of</p>\n<p>plaice and cod and mackerel and soles and smelts.</p>\n<p>Bobbie got home in time for tea, and she felt</p>\n<p>as though her mind would burst with all that had</p>\n<p>been put into it since she parted from the others.</p>\n<p>How she blessed the nail that had torn her frock!</p>",
        "<p>“Where have you been?” asked the others.</p>\n<p>“To the station, of course,” said Roberta. But she would</p>\n<p>not tell a word of her adventures till the day</p>\n<p>appointed, when she mysteriously led them to the station at</p>\n<p>the hour of the 3.19's transit, and proudly introduced them</p>\n<p>to her friends, Bill and Jim. Jim's second cousin's wife's</p>\n<p>brother had not been unworthy of the sacred trust reposed</p>",
        "<p>in him. The toy engine was, literally, as good as</p>\n<p>new.</p>\n<p>“Good-bye--oh, good-bye,” said Bobbie, just before the engine screamed ITS</p>\n<p>good-bye. “I shall always, always love you--and Jim's second cousin's</p>\n<p>wife's brother as well!”</p>\n<p>And as the three children went home up the hill,</p>\n<p>Peter hugging the engine, now quite its own self again,</p>",
        "<p>Bobbie told, with joyous leaps of the heart, the story</p>\n<p>of how she had been an Engine-burglar.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter V.</h3>\n<p>Prisoners and captives.</p>\n<p>It was one day when Mother had gone to Maidbridge.</p>\n<p>She had gone alone, but the children were to go</p>\n<p>to the station to meet her. And, loving the station</p>\n<p>as they did, it was only natural that they should</p>\n<p>be there a good hour before there was any chance</p>\n<p>of Mother's train arriving, even if the train were punctual,</p>",
        "<p>which was most unlikely. No doubt they would have been</p>\n<p>just as early, even if it had been a fine</p>\n<p>day, and all the delights of woods and fields and</p>\n<p>rocks and rivers had been open to them. But it</p>\n<p>happened to be a very wet day and, for July,</p>\n<p>very cold. There was a wild wind that drove flocks</p>\n<p>of dark purple clouds across the sky “like herds of</p>",
        "<p>dream-elephants,” as Phyllis said. And the rain stung sharply, so</p>\n<p>that the way to the station was finished at a</p>\n<p>run. Then the rain fell faster and harder, and beat</p>\n<p>slantwise against the windows of the booking office and of</p>\n<p>the chill place that had General Waiting Room on its</p>\n<p>door.</p>\n<p>“It's like being in a besieged castle,” Phyllis said; “look</p>",
        "<p>at the arrows of the foe striking against the battlements!”</p>\n<p>“It's much more like a great garden-squirt,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>They decided to wait on the up side, for the</p>\n<p>down platform looked very wet indeed, and the rain was</p>\n<p>driving right into the little bleak shelter where down-passengers have</p>\n<p>to wait for their trains.</p>\n<p>The hour would be full of incident and of interest,</p>",
        "<p>for there would be two up trains and one down</p>\n<p>to look at before the one that should bring Mother</p>\n<p>back.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps it'll have stopped raining by then,” said Bobbie; “anyhow,</p>\n<p>I'm glad I brought Mother's waterproof and umbrella.”</p>\n<p>They went into the desert spot labelled General Waiting Room,</p>\n<p>and the time passed pleasantly enough in a game of</p>",
        "<p>advertisements. You know the game, of course? It is something</p>\n<p>like dumb Crambo. The players take it in turns to</p>\n<p>go out, and then come back and look as like</p>\n<p>some advertisement as they can, and the others have to</p>\n<p>guess what advertisement it is meant to be. Bobbie came</p>\n<p>in and sat down under Mother's umbrella and made a</p>\n<p>sharp face, and everyone knew she was the fox who</p>",
        "<p>sits under the umbrella in the advertisement. Phyllis tried to</p>\n<p>make a Magic Carpet of Mother's waterproof, but it would</p>\n<p>not stand out stiff and raft-like as a Magic Carpet</p>\n<p>should, and nobody could guess it. Everyone thought Peter was</p>\n<p>carrying things a little too far when he blacked his</p>\n<p>face all over with coal-dust and struck a spidery attitude</p>\n<p>and said he was the blot that advertises somebody's Blue</p>",
        "<p>Black Writing Fluid.</p>\n<p>It was Phyllis's turn again, and she was trying to</p>\n<p>look like the Sphinx that advertises What's-his-name's Personally Conducted Tours</p>\n<p>up the Nile when the sharp ting of the signal</p>\n<p>announced the up train. The children rushed out to see</p>\n<p>it pass. On its engine were the particular driver and</p>\n<p>fireman who were now numbered among the children's dearest friends.</p>",
        "<p>Courtesies passed between them. Jim asked after the toy engine,</p>\n<p>and Bobbie pressed on his acceptance a moist, greasy package</p>\n<p>of toffee that she had made herself.</p>\n<p>Charmed by this attention, the engine-driver consented to consider her</p>\n<p>request that some day he would take Peter for a</p>\n<p>ride on the engine.</p>\n<p>“Stand back, Mates,” cried the engine-driver, suddenly, “and horf she</p>",
        "<p>goes.”</p>\n<p>And sure enough, off the train went. The children watched</p>\n<p>the tail-lights of the train till it disappeared round the</p>\n<p>curve of the line, and then turned to go back</p>\n<p>to the dusty freedom of the General Waiting Room and</p>\n<p>the joys of the advertisement game.</p>\n<p>They expected to see just one or two people, the</p>",
        "<p>end of the procession of passengers who had given up</p>\n<p>their tickets and gone away. Instead, the platform round the</p>\n<p>door of the station had a dark blot round it,</p>\n<p>and the dark blot was a crowd of people.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” cried Peter, with a thrill of joyous excitement, “something's</p>\n<p>happened! Come on!”</p>\n<p>They ran down the platform. When they got to the</p>",
        "<p>crowd, they could, of course, see nothing but the damp</p>\n<p>backs and elbows of the people on the crowd's outside.</p>\n<p>Everybody was talking at once. It was evident that something</p>\n<p>had happened.</p>\n<p>“It's my belief he's nothing worse than a natural,” said</p>\n<p>a farmerish-looking person. Peter saw his red, clean-shaven face as</p>\n<p>he spoke.</p>",
        "<p>“If you ask me, I should say it was a</p>\n<p>Police Court case,” said a young man with a black</p>\n<p>bag.</p>\n<p>“Not it; the Infirmary more like--”</p>\n<p>Then the voice of the Station Master was heard, firm</p>\n<p>and official:--</p>\n<p>“Now, then--move along there. I'll attend to this, if YOU</p>",
        "<p>please.”</p>\n<p>But the crowd did not move. And then came a</p>\n<p>voice that thrilled the children through and through. For it</p>\n<p>spoke in a foreign language. And, what is more, it</p>\n<p>was a language that they had never heard. They had</p>\n<p>heard French spoken and German. Aunt Emma knew German, and</p>\n<p>used to sing a song about bedeuten and zeiten and</p>",
        "<p>bin and sin. Nor was it Latin. Peter had been</p>\n<p>in Latin for four terms.</p>\n<p>It was some comfort, anyhow, to find that none of</p>\n<p>the crowd understood the foreign language any better than the</p>\n<p>children did.</p>\n<p>“What's that he's saying?” asked the farmer, heavily.</p>\n<p>“Sounds like French to me,” said the Station Master, who</p>",
        "<p>had once been to Boulogne for the day.</p>\n<p>“It isn't French!” cried Peter.</p>\n<p>“What is it, then?” asked more than one voice. The</p>\n<p>crowd fell back a little to see who had spoken,</p>\n<p>and Peter pressed forward, so that when the crowd closed</p>\n<p>up again he was in the front rank.</p>\n<p>“I don't know what it is,” said Peter, “but it</p>",
        "<p>isn't French. I know that.” Then he saw what it</p>\n<p>was that the crowd had for its centre. It was</p>\n<p>a man--the man, Peter did not doubt, who had spoken</p>\n<p>in that strange tongue. A man with long hair and</p>\n<p>wild eyes, with shabby clothes of a cut Peter had</p>\n<p>not seen before--a man whose hands and lips trembled, and</p>\n<p>who spoke again as his eyes fell on Peter.</p>",
        "<p>“No, it's not French,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Try him with French if you know so much about</p>\n<p>it,” said the farmer-man.</p>\n<p>“Parlay voo Frongsay?” began Peter, boldly, and the next moment</p>\n<p>the crowd recoiled again, for the man with the wild</p>\n<p>eyes had left leaning against the wall, and had sprung</p>\n<p>forward and caught Peter's hands, and begun to pour forth</p>",
        "<p>a flood of words which, though he could not understand</p>\n<p>a word of them, Peter knew the sound of.</p>\n<p>“There!” said he, and turned, his hands still clasped in</p>\n<p>the hands of the strange shabby figure, to throw a</p>\n<p>glance of triumph at the crowd; “there; THAT'S French.”</p>\n<p>“What does he say?”</p>\n<p>“I don't know.” Peter was obliged to own it.</p>",
        "<p>“Here,” said the Station Master again; “you move on if</p>\n<p>you please. I'LL deal with this case.”</p>\n<p>A few of the more timid or less inquisitive travellers</p>\n<p>moved slowly and reluctantly away. And Phyllis and Bobbie got</p>\n<p>near to Peter. All three had been TAUGHT French at</p>\n<p>school. How deeply they now wished that they had LEARNED</p>\n<p>it! Peter shook his head at the stranger, but he</p>",
        "<p>also shook his hands as warmly and looked at him</p>\n<p>as kindly as he could. A person in the crowd,</p>\n<p>after some hesitation, said suddenly, “No comprenny!” and then, blushing</p>\n<p>deeply, backed out of the press and went away.</p>\n<p>“Take him into your room,” whispered Bobbie to the Station</p>\n<p>Master. “Mother can talk French. She'll be here by the</p>\n<p>next train from Maidbridge.”</p>",
        "<p>The Station Master took the arm of the stranger, suddenly</p>\n<p>but not unkindly. But the man wrenched his arm away,</p>\n<p>and cowered back coughing and trembling and trying to push</p>\n<p>the Station Master away.</p>\n<p>“Oh, don't!” said Bobbie; “don't you see how frightened he</p>\n<p>is? He thinks you're going to shut him up. I</p>\n<p>know he does--look at his eyes!”</p>",
        "<p>“They're like a fox's eyes when the beast's in a</p>\n<p>trap,” said the farmer.</p>\n<p>“Oh, let me try!” Bobbie went on; “I do really</p>\n<p>know one or two French words if I could only</p>\n<p>think of them.”</p>\n<p>Sometimes, in moments of great need, we can do wonderful</p>\n<p>things--things that in ordinary life we could hardly even dream</p>",
        "<p>of doing. Bobbie had never been anywhere near the top</p>\n<p>of her French class, but she must have learned something</p>\n<p>without knowing it, for now, looking at those wild, hunted</p>\n<p>eyes, she actually remembered and, what is more, spoke, some</p>\n<p>French words. She said:--</p>\n<p>“Vous attendre. Ma mere parlez Francais. Nous--what's the French for</p>\n<p>'being kind'?”</p>",
        "<p>Nobody knew.</p>\n<p>“Bong is 'good,'” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Nous etre bong pour vous.”</p>\n<p>I do not know whether the man understood her words,</p>\n<p>but he understood the touch of the hand she thrust</p>\n<p>into his, and the kindness of the other hand that</p>\n<p>stroked his shabby sleeve.</p>",
        "<p>She pulled him gently towards the inmost sanctuary of the</p>\n<p>Station Master. The other children followed, and the Station Master</p>\n<p>shut the door in the face of the crowd, which</p>\n<p>stood a little while in the booking office talking and</p>\n<p>looking at the fast closed yellow door, and then by</p>\n<p>ones and twos went its way, grumbling.</p>\n<p>Inside the Station Master's room Bobbie still held the stranger's</p>",
        "<p>hand and stroked his sleeve.</p>\n<p>“Here's a go,” said the Station Master; “no ticket--doesn't even</p>\n<p>know where he wants to go. I'm not sure now</p>\n<p>but what I ought to send for the police.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, DON'T!” all the children pleaded at once. And suddenly</p>\n<p>Bobbie got between the others and the stranger, for she</p>\n<p>had seen that he was crying.</p>",
        "<p>By a most unusual piece of good fortune she had</p>\n<p>a handkerchief in her pocket. By a still more uncommon</p>\n<p>accident the handkerchief was moderately clean. Standing in front of</p>\n<p>the stranger, she got out the handkerchief and passed it</p>\n<p>to him so that the others did not see.</p>\n<p>“Wait till Mother comes,” Phyllis was saying; “she does speak</p>\n<p>French beautifully. You'd just love to hear her.”</p>",
        "<p>“I'm sure he hasn't done anything like you're sent to</p>\n<p>prison for,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Looks like without visible means to me,” said the Station</p>\n<p>Master. “Well, I don't mind giving him the benefit of</p>\n<p>the doubt till your Mamma comes. I SHOULD like to</p>\n<p>know what nation's got the credit of HIM, that I</p>\n<p>should.”</p>",
        "<p>Then Peter had an idea. He pulled an envelope out</p>\n<p>of his pocket, and showed that it was half full</p>\n<p>of foreign stamps.</p>\n<p>“Look here,” he said, “let's show him these--”</p>\n<p>Bobbie looked and saw that the stranger had dried his</p>\n<p>eyes with her handkerchief. So she said: “All right.”</p>\n<p>They showed him an Italian stamp, and pointed from him</p>",
        "<p>to it and back again, and made signs of question</p>\n<p>with their eyebrows. He shook his head. Then they showed</p>\n<p>him a Norwegian stamp--the common blue kind it was--and again</p>\n<p>he signed No. Then they showed him a Spanish one,</p>\n<p>and at that he took the envelope from Peter's hand</p>\n<p>and searched among the stamps with a hand that trembled.</p>\n<p>The hand that he reached out at last, with a</p>",
        "<p>gesture as of one answering a question, contained a RUSSIAN</p>\n<p>stamp.</p>\n<p>“He's Russian,” cried Peter, “or else he's like 'the man</p>\n<p>who was'--in Kipling, you know.”</p>\n<p>The train from Maidbridge was signalled.</p>\n<p>“I'll stay with him till you bring Mother in,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>“You're not afraid, Missie?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” said Bobbie, looking at the stranger, as she</p>\n<p>might have looked at a strange dog of doubtful temper.</p>\n<p>“You wouldn't hurt me, would you?”</p>\n<p>She smiled at him, and he smiled back, a queer</p>\n<p>crooked smile. And then he coughed again. And the heavy</p>\n<p>rattling swish of the incoming train swept past, and the</p>",
        "<p>Station Master and Peter and Phyllis went out to meet</p>\n<p>it. Bobbie was still holding the stranger's hand when they</p>\n<p>came back with Mother.</p>\n<p>The Russian rose and bowed very ceremoniously.</p>\n<p>Then Mother spoke in French, and he replied, haltingly at</p>\n<p>first, but presently in longer and longer sentences.</p>\n<p>The children, watching his face and Mother's, knew that he</p>",
        "<p>was telling her things that made her angry and pitying,</p>\n<p>and sorry and indignant all at once.</p>\n<p>“Well, Mum, what's it all about?” The Station Master could</p>\n<p>not restrain his curiosity any longer.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Mother, “it's all right. He's a Russian, and</p>\n<p>he's lost his ticket. And I'm afraid he's very ill.</p>\n<p>If you don't mind, I'll take him home with me</p>",
        "<p>now. He's really quite worn out. I'll run down and</p>\n<p>tell you all about him to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>“I hope you won't find you're taking home a frozen</p>\n<p>viper,” said the Station Master, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” Mother said brightly, and she smiled; “I'm quite</p>\n<p>sure I'm not. Why, he's a great man in his</p>\n<p>own country, writes books--beautiful books--I've read some of them; but</p>",
        "<p>I'll tell you all about it to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>She spoke again in French to the Russian, and everyone</p>\n<p>could see the surprise and pleasure and gratitude in his</p>\n<p>eyes. He got up and politely bowed to the Station</p>\n<p>Master, and offered his arm most ceremoniously to Mother. She</p>\n<p>took it, but anybody could have seen that she was</p>\n<p>helping him along, and not he her.</p>",
        "<p>“You girls run home and light a fire in the</p>\n<p>sitting-room,” Mother said, “and Peter had better go for the</p>\n<p>Doctor.”</p>\n<p>But it was Bobbie who went for the Doctor.</p>\n<p>“I hate to tell you,” she said breathlessly when she</p>\n<p>came upon him in his shirt sleeves, weeding his pansy-bed,</p>\n<p>“but Mother's got a very shabby Russian, and I'm sure</p>",
        "<p>he'll have to belong to your Club. I'm certain he</p>\n<p>hasn't got any money. We found him at the station.”</p>\n<p>“Found him! Was he lost, then?” asked the Doctor, reaching</p>\n<p>for his coat.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie, unexpectedly, “that's just what he was. He's</p>\n<p>been telling Mother the sad, sweet story of his life</p>\n<p>in French; and she said would you be kind enough</p>",
        "<p>to come directly if you were at home. He has</p>\n<p>a dreadful cough, and he's been crying.”</p>\n<p>The Doctor smiled.</p>\n<p>“Oh, don't,” said Bobbie; “please don't. You wouldn't if you'd</p>\n<p>seen him. I never saw a man cry before. You</p>\n<p>don't know what it's like.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Forrest wished then that he hadn't smiled.</p>",
        "<p>When Bobbie and the Doctor got to Three Chimneys, the</p>\n<p>Russian was sitting in the arm-chair that had been Father's,</p>\n<p>stretching his feet to the blaze of a bright wood</p>\n<p>fire, and sipping the tea Mother had made him.</p>\n<p>“The man seems worn out, mind and body,” was what</p>\n<p>the Doctor said; “the cough's bad, but there's nothing that</p>\n<p>can't be cured. He ought to go straight to bed,</p>",
        "<p>though--and let him have a fire at night.”</p>\n<p>“I'll make one in my room; it's the only one</p>\n<p>with a fireplace,” said Mother. She did, and presently the</p>\n<p>Doctor helped the stranger to bed.</p>\n<p>There was a big black trunk in Mother's room that</p>\n<p>none of the children had ever seen unlocked. Now, when</p>\n<p>she had lighted the fire, she unlocked it and took</p>",
        "<p>some clothes out--men's clothes--and set them to air by the</p>\n<p>newly lighted fire. Bobbie, coming in with more wood for</p>\n<p>the fire, saw the mark on the night-shirt, and looked</p>\n<p>over to the open trunk. All the things she could</p>\n<p>see were men's clothes. And the name marked on the</p>\n<p>shirt was Father's name. Then Father hadn't taken his clothes</p>\n<p>with him. And that night-shirt was one of Father's new</p>",
        "<p>ones. Bobbie remembered its being made, just before Peter's birthday.</p>\n<p>Why hadn't Father taken his clothes? Bobbie slipped from the</p>\n<p>room. As she went she heard the key turned in</p>\n<p>the lock of the trunk. Her heart was beating horribly.</p>\n<p>WHY hadn't Father taken his clothes? When Mother came out</p>\n<p>of the room, Bobbie flung tightly clasping arms round her</p>\n<p>waist, and whispered:--</p>",
        "<p>“Mother--Daddy isn't--isn't DEAD, is he?”</p>\n<p>“My darling, no! What made you think of anything so</p>\n<p>horrible?”</p>\n<p>“I--I don't know,” said Bobbie, angry with herself, but still</p>\n<p>clinging to that resolution of hers, not to see anything</p>\n<p>that Mother didn't mean her to see.</p>\n<p>Mother gave her a hurried hug. “Daddy was quite, QUITE</p>",
        "<p>well when I heard from him last,” she said, “and</p>\n<p>he'll come back to us some day. Don't fancy such</p>\n<p>horrible things, darling!”</p>\n<p>Later on, when the Russian stranger had been made comfortable</p>\n<p>for the night, Mother came into the girls' room. She</p>\n<p>was to sleep there in Phyllis's bed, and Phyllis was</p>\n<p>to have a mattress on the floor, a most amusing</p>",
        "<p>adventure for Phyllis. Directly Mother came in, two white figures</p>\n<p>started up, and two eager voices called:--</p>\n<p>“Now, Mother, tell us all about the Russian gentleman.”</p>\n<p>A white shape hopped into the room. It was Peter,</p>\n<p>dragging his quilt behind him like the tail of a</p>\n<p>white peacock.</p>\n<p>“We have been patient,” he said, “and I had to</p>",
        "<p>bite my tongue not to go to sleep, and I</p>\n<p>just nearly went to sleep and I bit too hard,</p>\n<p>and it hurts ever so. DO tell us. Make a</p>\n<p>nice long story of it.”</p>\n<p>“I can't make a long story of it to-night,” said</p>\n<p>Mother; “I'm very tired.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie knew by her voice that Mother had been crying,</p>",
        "<p>but the others didn't know.</p>\n<p>“Well, make it as long as you can,” said Phil,</p>\n<p>and Bobbie got her arms round Mother's waist and snuggled</p>\n<p>close to her.</p>\n<p>“Well, it's a story long enough to make a whole</p>\n<p>book of. He's a writer; he's written beautiful books. In</p>\n<p>Russia at the time of the Czar one dared not</p>",
        "<p>say anything about the rich people doing wrong, or about</p>\n<p>the things that ought to be done to make poor</p>\n<p>people better and happier. If one did one was sent</p>\n<p>to prison.”</p>\n<p>“But they CAN'T,” said Peter; “people only go to prison</p>\n<p>when they've done wrong.”</p>\n<p>“Or when the Judges THINK they've done wrong,” said Mother.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, that's so in England. But in Russia it was</p>\n<p>different. And he wrote a beautiful book about poor people</p>\n<p>and how to help them. I've read it. There's nothing</p>\n<p>in it but goodness and kindness. And they sent him</p>\n<p>to prison for it. He was three years in a</p>\n<p>horrible dungeon, with hardly any light, and all damp and</p>\n<p>dreadful. In prison all alone for three years.”</p>",
        "<p>Mother's voice trembled a little and stopped suddenly.</p>\n<p>“But, Mother,” said Peter, “that can't be true NOW. It</p>\n<p>sounds like something out of a history book--the Inquisition, or</p>\n<p>something.”</p>\n<p>“It WAS true,” said Mother; “it's all horribly true. Well,</p>\n<p>then they took him out and sent him to Siberia,</p>\n<p>a convict chained to other convicts--wicked men who'd done all</p>",
        "<p>sorts of crimes--a long chain of them, and they walked,</p>\n<p>and walked, and walked, for days and weeks, till he</p>\n<p>thought they'd never stop walking. And overseers went behind them</p>\n<p>with whips--yes, whips--to beat them if they got tired. And</p>\n<p>some of them went lame, and some fell down, and</p>\n<p>when they couldn't get up and go on, they beat</p>\n<p>them, and then left them to die. Oh, it's all</p>",
        "<p>too terrible! And at last he got to the mines,</p>\n<p>and he was condemned to stay there for life--for life,</p>\n<p>just for writing a good, noble, splendid book.”</p>\n<p>“How did he get away?”</p>\n<p>“When the war came, some of the Russian prisoners were</p>\n<p>allowed to volunteer as soldiers. And he volunteered. But he</p>\n<p>deserted at the first chance he got and--”</p>",
        "<p>“But that's very cowardly, isn't it”--said Peter--“to desert? Especially when</p>\n<p>it's war.”</p>\n<p>“Do you think he owed anything to a country that</p>\n<p>had done THAT to him? If he did, he owed</p>\n<p>more to his wife and children. He didn't know what</p>\n<p>had become of them.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” cried Bobbie, “he had THEM to think about and</p>",
        "<p>be miserable about TOO, then, all the time he was</p>\n<p>in prison?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, he had them to think about and be miserable</p>\n<p>about all the time he was in prison. For anything</p>\n<p>he knew they might have been sent to prison, too.</p>\n<p>They did those things in Russia. But while he was</p>\n<p>in the mines some friends managed to get a message</p>",
        "<p>to him that his wife and children had escaped and</p>\n<p>come to England. So when he deserted he came here</p>\n<p>to look for them.”</p>\n<p>“Had he got their address?” said practical Peter.</p>\n<p>“No; just England. He was going to London, and he</p>\n<p>thought he had to change at our station, and then</p>\n<p>he found he'd lost his ticket and his purse.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, DO you think he'll find them?--I mean his wife</p>\n<p>and children, not the ticket and things.”</p>\n<p>“I hope so. Oh, I hope and pray that he'll</p>\n<p>find his wife and children again.”</p>\n<p>Even Phyllis now perceived that mother's voice was very unsteady.</p>\n<p>“Why, Mother,” she said, “how very sorry you seem to</p>\n<p>be for him!”</p>",
        "<p>Mother didn't answer for a minute. Then she just said,</p>\n<p>“Yes,” and then she seemed to be thinking. The children</p>\n<p>were quiet.</p>\n<p>Presently she said, “Dears, when you say your prayers, I</p>\n<p>think you might ask God to show His pity upon</p>\n<p>all prisoners and captives.”</p>\n<p>“To show His pity,” Bobbie repeated slowly, “upon all prisoners</p>",
        "<p>and captives. Is that right, Mother?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mother, “upon all prisoners and captives. All prisoners</p>\n<p>and captives.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VI.</h3>\n<p>Saviours of the train.</p>\n<p>The Russian gentleman was better the next day, and the</p>\n<p>day after that better still, and on the third day</p>\n<p>he was well enough to come into the garden. A</p>\n<p>basket chair was put for him and he sat there,</p>\n<p>dressed in clothes of Father's which were too big for</p>\n<p>him. But when Mother had hemmed up the ends of</p>",
        "<p>the sleeves and the trousers, the clothes did well enough.</p>\n<p>His was a kind face now that it was no</p>\n<p>longer tired and frightened, and he smiled at the children</p>\n<p>whenever he saw them. They wished very much that he</p>\n<p>could speak English. Mother wrote several letters to people she</p>\n<p>thought might know whereabouts in England a Russian gentleman's wife</p>\n<p>and family might possibly be; not to the people she</p>",
        "<p>used to know before she came to live at Three</p>\n<p>Chimneys--she never wrote to any of them--but strange people--Members of</p>\n<p>Parliament and Editors of papers, and Secretaries of Societies.</p>\n<p>And she did not do much of her story-writing, only</p>\n<p>corrected proofs as she sat in the sun near the</p>\n<p>Russian, and talked to him every now and then.</p>\n<p>The children wanted very much to show how kindly they</p>",
        "<p>felt to this man who had been sent to prison</p>\n<p>and to Siberia just for writing a beautiful book about</p>\n<p>poor people. They could smile at him, of course; they</p>\n<p>could and they did. But if you smile too constantly,</p>\n<p>the smile is apt to get fixed like the smile</p>\n<p>of the hyaena. And then it no longer looks friendly,</p>\n<p>but simply silly. So they tried other ways, and brought</p>",
        "<p>him flowers till the place where he sat was surrounded</p>\n<p>by little fading bunches of clover and roses and Canterbury</p>\n<p>bells.</p>\n<p>And then Phyllis had an idea. She beckoned mysteriously to</p>\n<p>the others and drew them into the back yard, and</p>\n<p>there, in a concealed spot, between the pump and the</p>\n<p>water-butt, she said:--</p>",
        "<p>“You remember Perks promising me the very first strawberries out</p>\n<p>of his own garden?” Perks, you will recollect, was the</p>\n<p>Porter. “Well, I should think they're ripe now. Let's go</p>\n<p>down and see.”</p>\n<p>Mother had been down as she had promised to tell</p>\n<p>the Station Master the story of the Russian Prisoner. But</p>\n<p>even the charms of the railway had been unable to</p>",
        "<p>tear the children away from the neighbourhood of the interesting</p>\n<p>stranger. So they had not been to the station for</p>\n<p>three days.</p>\n<p>They went now.</p>\n<p>And, to their surprise and distress, were very coldly received</p>\n<p>by Perks.</p>\n<p>“'Ighly honoured, I'm sure,” he said when they peeped in</p>",
        "<p>at the door of the Porters' room. And he went</p>\n<p>on reading his newspaper.</p>\n<p>There was an uncomfortable silence.</p>\n<p>“Oh, dear,” said Bobbie, with a sigh, “I do believe</p>\n<p>you're CROSS.”</p>\n<p>“What, me? Not me!” said Perks loftily; “it ain't nothing</p>\n<p>to me.”</p>",
        "<p>“What AIN'T nothing to you?” said Peter, too anxious and</p>\n<p>alarmed to change the form of words.</p>\n<p>“Nothing ain't nothing. What 'appens either 'ere or elsewhere,” said</p>\n<p>Perks; “if you likes to 'ave your secrets, 'ave 'em</p>\n<p>and welcome. That's what I say.”</p>\n<p>The secret-chamber of each heart was rapidly examined during the</p>\n<p>pause that followed. Three heads were shaken.</p>",
        "<p>“We haven't got any secrets from YOU,” said Bobbie at</p>\n<p>last.</p>\n<p>“Maybe you 'ave, and maybe you 'aven't,” said Perks; “it</p>\n<p>ain't nothing to me. And I wish you all a</p>\n<p>very good afternoon.” He held up the paper between him</p>\n<p>and them and went on reading.</p>\n<p>“Oh, DON'T!” said Phyllis, in despair; “this is truly dreadful!</p>",
        "<p>Whatever it is, do tell us.”</p>\n<p>“We didn't mean to do it whatever it was.”</p>\n<p>No answer. The paper was refolded and Perks began on</p>\n<p>another column.</p>\n<p>“Look here,” said Peter, suddenly, “it's not fair. Even people</p>\n<p>who do crimes aren't punished without being told what it's</p>\n<p>for--as once they were in Russia.”</p>",
        "<p>“I don't know nothing about Russia.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, you do, when Mother came down on purpose</p>\n<p>to tell you and Mr. Gills all about OUR Russian.”</p>\n<p>“Can't you fancy it?” said Perks, indignantly; “don't you see</p>\n<p>'im a-asking of me to step into 'is room and</p>\n<p>take a chair and listen to what 'er Ladyship 'as</p>\n<p>to say?”</p>",
        "<p>“Do you mean to say you've not heard?”</p>\n<p>“Not so much as a breath. I did go so</p>\n<p>far as to put a question. And he shuts me</p>\n<p>up like a rat-trap. 'Affairs of State, Perks,' says he.</p>\n<p>But I did think one o' you would 'a' nipped</p>\n<p>down to tell me--you're here sharp enough when you want</p>\n<p>to get anything out of old Perks”--Phyllis flushed purple as</p>",
        "<p>she thought of the strawberries--“information about locomotives or signals or</p>\n<p>the likes,” said Perks.</p>\n<p>“We didn't know you didn't know.”</p>\n<p>“We thought Mother had told you.”</p>\n<p>“Wewantedtotellyouonlywethoughtitwouldbestalenews.”</p>\n<p>The three spoke all at once.</p>\n<p>Perks said it was all very well, and still held</p>",
        "<p>up the paper. Then Phyllis suddenly snatched it away, and</p>\n<p>threw her arms round his neck.</p>\n<p>“Oh, let's kiss and be friends,” she said; “we'll say</p>\n<p>we're sorry first, if you like, but we didn't really</p>\n<p>know that you didn't know.”</p>\n<p>“We are so sorry,” said the others.</p>\n<p>And Perks at last consented to accept their apologies.</p>",
        "<p>Then they got him to come out and sit in</p>\n<p>the sun on the green Railway Bank, where the grass</p>\n<p>was quite hot to touch, and there, sometimes speaking one</p>\n<p>at a time, and sometimes all together, they told the</p>\n<p>Porter the story of the Russian Prisoner.</p>\n<p>“Well, I must say,” said Perks; but he did not</p>\n<p>say it--whatever it was.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, it is pretty awful, isn't it?” said Peter, “and</p>\n<p>I don't wonder you were curious about who the Russian</p>\n<p>was.”</p>\n<p>“I wasn't curious, not so much as interested,” said the</p>\n<p>Porter.</p>\n<p>“Well, I do think Mr. Gills might have told you</p>\n<p>about it. It was horrid of him.”</p>",
        "<p>“I don't keep no down on 'im for that, Missie,”</p>\n<p>said the Porter; “cos why? I see 'is reasons. 'E</p>\n<p>wouldn't want to give away 'is own side with a</p>\n<p>tale like that 'ere. It ain't human nature. A man's</p>\n<p>got to stand up for his own side whatever they</p>\n<p>does. That's what it means by Party Politics. I should</p>\n<p>'a' done the same myself if that long-'aired chap 'ad</p>",
        "<p>'a' been a Jap.”</p>\n<p>“But the Japs didn't do cruel, wicked things like that,”</p>\n<p>said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“P'r'aps not,” said Perks, cautiously; “still you can't be sure</p>\n<p>with foreigners. My own belief is they're all tarred with</p>\n<p>the same brush.”</p>\n<p>“Then why were you on the side of the Japs?”</p>",
        "<p>Peter asked.</p>\n<p>“Well, you see, you must take one side or the</p>\n<p>other. Same as with Liberals and Conservatives. The great thing</p>\n<p>is to take your side and then stick to it,</p>\n<p>whatever happens.”</p>\n<p>A signal sounded.</p>\n<p>“There's the 3.14 up,” said Perks. “You lie low till</p>",
        "<p>she's through, and then we'll go up along to my</p>\n<p>place, and see if there's any of them strawberries ripe</p>\n<p>what I told you about.”</p>\n<p>“If there are any ripe, and you DO give them</p>\n<p>to me,” said Phyllis, “you won't mind if I give</p>\n<p>them to the poor Russian, will you?”</p>\n<p>Perks narrowed his eyes and then raised his eyebrows.</p>",
        "<p>“So it was them strawberries you come down for this</p>\n<p>afternoon, eh?” said he.</p>\n<p>This was an awkward moment for Phyllis. To say “yes”</p>\n<p>would seem rude and greedy, and unkind to Perks. But</p>\n<p>she knew if she said “no,” she would not be</p>\n<p>pleased with herself afterwards. So--</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “it was.”</p>",
        "<p>“Well done!” said the Porter; “speak the truth and shame</p>\n<p>the--”</p>\n<p>“But we'd have come down the very next day if</p>\n<p>we'd known you hadn't heard the story,” Phyllis added hastily.</p>\n<p>“I believe you, Missie,” said Perks, and sprang across the</p>\n<p>line six feet in front of the advancing train.</p>\n<p>The girls hated to see him do this, but Peter</p>",
        "<p>liked it. It was so exciting.</p>\n<p>The Russian gentleman was so delighted with the strawberries that</p>\n<p>the three racked their brains to find some other surprise</p>\n<p>for him. But all the racking did not bring out</p>\n<p>any idea more novel than wild cherries. And this idea</p>\n<p>occurred to them next morning. They had seen the blossom</p>\n<p>on the trees in the spring, and they knew where</p>",
        "<p>to look for wild cherries now that cherry time was</p>\n<p>here. The trees grew all up and along the rocky</p>\n<p>face of the cliff out of which the mouth of</p>\n<p>the tunnel opened. There were all sorts of trees there,</p>\n<p>birches and beeches and baby oaks and hazels, and among</p>\n<p>them the cherry blossom had shone like snow and silver.</p>\n<p>The mouth of the tunnel was some way from Three</p>",
        "<p>Chimneys, so Mother let them take their lunch with them</p>\n<p>in a basket. And the basket would do to bring</p>\n<p>the cherries back in if they found any. She also</p>\n<p>lent them her silver watch so that they should not</p>\n<p>be late for tea. Peter's Waterbury had taken it into</p>\n<p>its head not to go since the day when Peter</p>\n<p>dropped it into the water-butt. And they started. When they</p>",
        "<p>got to the top of the cutting, they leaned over</p>\n<p>the fence and looked down to where the railway lines</p>\n<p>lay at the bottom of what, as Phyllis said, was</p>\n<p>exactly like a mountain gorge.</p>\n<p>“If it wasn't for the railway at the bottom, it</p>\n<p>would be as though the foot of man had never</p>\n<p>been there, wouldn't it?”</p>",
        "<p>The sides of the cutting were of grey stone, very</p>\n<p>roughly hewn. Indeed, the top part of the cutting had</p>\n<p>been a little natural glen that had been cut deeper</p>\n<p>to bring it down to the level of the tunnel's</p>\n<p>mouth. Among the rocks, grass and flowers grew, and seeds</p>\n<p>dropped by birds in the crannies of the stone had</p>\n<p>taken root and grown into bushes and trees that overhung</p>",
        "<p>the cutting. Near the tunnel was a flight of steps</p>\n<p>leading down to the line--just wooden bars roughly fixed into</p>\n<p>the earth--a very steep and narrow way, more like a</p>\n<p>ladder than a stair.</p>\n<p>“We'd better get down,” said Peter; “I'm sure the cherries</p>\n<p>would be quite easy to get at from the side</p>\n<p>of the steps. You remember it was there we picked</p>",
        "<p>the cherry blossoms that we put on the rabbit's grave.”</p>\n<p>So they went along the fence towards the little swing</p>\n<p>gate that is at the top of these steps. And</p>\n<p>they were almost at the gate when Bobbie said:--</p>\n<p>“Hush. Stop! What's that?”</p>\n<p>“That” was a very odd noise indeed--a soft noise, but</p>\n<p>quite plainly to be heard through the sound of the</p>",
        "<p>wind in tree branches, and the hum and whir of</p>\n<p>the telegraph wires. It was a sort of rustling, whispering</p>\n<p>sound. As they listened it stopped, and then it began</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>And this time it did not stop, but it grew</p>\n<p>louder and more rustling and rumbling.</p>\n<p>“Look”--cried Peter, suddenly--“the tree over there!”</p>",
        "<p>The tree he pointed at was one of those that</p>\n<p>have rough grey leaves and white flowers. The berries, when</p>\n<p>they come, are bright scarlet, but if you pick them,</p>\n<p>they disappoint you by turning black before you get them</p>\n<p>home. And, as Peter pointed, the tree was moving--not just</p>\n<p>the way trees ought to move when the wind blows</p>\n<p>through them, but all in one piece, as though it</p>",
        "<p>were a live creature and were walking down the side</p>\n<p>of the cutting.</p>\n<p>“It's moving!” cried Bobbie. “Oh, look! and so are the</p>\n<p>others. It's like the woods in Macbeth.”</p>\n<p>“It's magic,” said Phyllis, breathlessly. “I always knew this railway</p>\n<p>was enchanted.”</p>\n<p>It really did seem a little like magic. For all</p>",
        "<p>the trees for about twenty yards of the opposite bank</p>\n<p>seemed to be slowly walking down towards the railway line,</p>\n<p>the tree with the grey leaves bringing up the rear</p>\n<p>like some old shepherd driving a flock of green sheep.</p>\n<p>“What is it? Oh, what is it?” said Phyllis; “it's</p>\n<p>much too magic for me. I don't like it. Let's</p>\n<p>go home.”</p>",
        "<p>But Bobbie and Peter clung fast to the rail and</p>\n<p>watched breathlessly. And Phyllis made no movement towards going home</p>\n<p>by herself.</p>\n<p>The trees moved on and on. Some stones and loose</p>\n<p>earth fell down and rattled on the railway metals far</p>\n<p>below.</p>\n<p>“It's ALL coming down,” Peter tried to say, but he</p>",
        "<p>found there was hardly any voice to say it with.</p>\n<p>And, indeed, just as he spoke, the great rock, on</p>\n<p>the top of which the walking trees were, leaned slowly</p>\n<p>forward. The trees, ceasing to walk, stood still and shivered.</p>\n<p>Leaning with the rock, they seemed to hesitate a moment,</p>\n<p>and then rock and trees and grass and bushes, with</p>\n<p>a rushing sound, slipped right away from the face of</p>",
        "<p>the cutting and fell on the line with a blundering</p>\n<p>crash that could have been heard half a mile off.</p>\n<p>A cloud of dust rose up.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Peter, in awestruck tones, “isn't it exactly like</p>\n<p>when coals come in?--if there wasn't any roof to the</p>\n<p>cellar and you could see down.”</p>\n<p>“Look what a great mound it's made!” said Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” said Peter, slowly. He was still leaning on the</p>\n<p>fence. “Yes,” he said again, still more slowly.</p>\n<p>Then he stood upright.</p>\n<p>“The 11.29 down hasn't gone by yet. We must let</p>\n<p>them know at the station, or there'll be a most</p>\n<p>frightful accident.”</p>\n<p>“Let's run,” said Bobbie, and began.</p>",
        "<p>But Peter cried, “Come back!” and looked at Mother's watch.</p>\n<p>He was very prompt and businesslike, and his face looked</p>\n<p>whiter than they had ever seen it.</p>\n<p>“No time,” he said; “it's two miles away, and it's</p>\n<p>past eleven.”</p>\n<p>“Couldn't we,” suggested Phyllis, breathlessly, “couldn't we climb up a</p>\n<p>telegraph post and do something to the wires?”</p>",
        "<p>“We don't know how,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“They do it in war,” said Phyllis; “I know I've</p>\n<p>heard of it.”</p>\n<p>“They only CUT them, silly,” said Peter, “and that doesn't</p>\n<p>do any good. And we couldn't cut them even if</p>\n<p>we got up, and we couldn't get up. If we</p>\n<p>had anything red, we could get down on the line</p>",
        "<p>and wave it.”</p>\n<p>“But the train wouldn't see us till it got round</p>\n<p>the corner, and then it could see the mound just</p>\n<p>as well as us,” said Phyllis; “better, because it's much</p>\n<p>bigger than us.”</p>\n<p>“If we only had something red,” Peter repeated, “we could</p>\n<p>go round the corner and wave to the train.”</p>",
        "<p>“We might wave, anyway.”</p>\n<p>“They'd only think it was just US, as usual. We've</p>\n<p>waved so often before. Anyway, let's get down.”</p>\n<p>They got down the steep stairs. Bobbie was pale and</p>\n<p>shivering. Peter's face looked thinner than usual. Phyllis was red-faced</p>\n<p>and damp with anxiety.</p>\n<p>“Oh, how hot I am!” she said; “and I thought</p>",
        "<p>it was going to be cold; I wish we hadn't</p>\n<p>put on our--” she stopped short, and then ended in</p>\n<p>quite a different tone--“our flannel petticoats.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie turned at the bottom of the stairs.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes,” she cried; “THEY'RE red! Let's take them off.”</p>\n<p>They did, and with the petticoats rolled up under their</p>\n<p>arms, ran along the railway, skirting the newly fallen mound</p>",
        "<p>of stones and rock and earth, and bent, crushed, twisted</p>\n<p>trees. They ran at their best pace. Peter led, but</p>\n<p>the girls were not far behind. They reached the corner</p>\n<p>that hid the mound from the straight line of railway</p>\n<p>that ran half a mile without curve or corner.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Peter, taking hold of the largest flannel petticoat.</p>\n<p>“You're not”--Phyllis faltered--“you're not going to TEAR them?”</p>",
        "<p>“Shut up,” said Peter, with brief sternness.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes,” said Bobbie, “tear them into little bits if</p>\n<p>you like. Don't you see, Phil, if we can't stop</p>\n<p>the train, there'll be a real live accident, with people</p>\n<p>KILLED. Oh, horrible! Here, Peter, you'll never tear it through</p>\n<p>the band!”</p>\n<p>She took the red flannel petticoat from him and tore</p>",
        "<p>it off an inch from the band. Then she tore</p>\n<p>the other in the same way.</p>\n<p>“There!” said Peter, tearing in his turn. He divided each</p>\n<p>petticoat into three pieces. “Now, we've got six flags.” He</p>\n<p>looked at the watch again. “And we've got seven minutes.</p>\n<p>We must have flagstaffs.”</p>\n<p>The knives given to boys are, for some odd reason,</p>",
        "<p>seldom of the kind of steel that keeps sharp. The</p>\n<p>young saplings had to be broken off. Two came up</p>\n<p>by the roots. The leaves were stripped from them.</p>\n<p>“We must cut holes in the flags, and run the</p>\n<p>sticks through the holes,” said Peter. And the holes were</p>\n<p>cut. The knife was sharp enough to cut flannel with.</p>\n<p>Two of the flags were set up in heaps of</p>",
        "<p>loose stones between the sleepers of the down line. Then</p>\n<p>Phyllis and Roberta took each a flag, and stood ready</p>\n<p>to wave it as soon as the train came in</p>\n<p>sight.</p>\n<p>“I shall have the other two myself,” said Peter, “because</p>\n<p>it was my idea to wave something red.”</p>\n<p>“They're our petticoats, though,” Phyllis was beginning, but Bobbie interrupted--</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, what does it matter who waves what, if we</p>\n<p>can only save the train?”</p>\n<p>Perhaps Peter had not rightly calculated the number of minutes</p>\n<p>it would take the 11.29 to get from the station</p>\n<p>to the place where they were, or perhaps the train</p>\n<p>was late. Anyway, it seemed a very long time that</p>\n<p>they waited.</p>",
        "<p>Phyllis grew impatient. “I expect the watch is wrong, and</p>\n<p>the train's gone by,” said she.</p>\n<p>Peter relaxed the heroic attitude he had chosen to show</p>\n<p>off his two flags. And Bobbie began to feel sick</p>\n<p>with suspense.</p>\n<p>It seemed to her that they had been standing there</p>\n<p>for hours and hours, holding those silly little red flannel</p>",
        "<p>flags that no one would ever notice. The train wouldn't</p>\n<p>care. It would go rushing by them and tear round</p>\n<p>the corner and go crashing into that awful mound. And</p>\n<p>everyone would be killed. Her hands grew very cold and</p>\n<p>trembled so that she could hardly hold the flag. And</p>\n<p>then came the distant rumble and hum of the metals,</p>\n<p>and a puff of white steam showed far away along</p>",
        "<p>the stretch of line.</p>\n<p>“Stand firm,” said Peter, “and wave like mad! When it</p>\n<p>gets to that big furze bush step back, but go</p>\n<p>on waving! Don't stand ON the line, Bobbie!”</p>\n<p>The train came rattling along very, very fast.</p>\n<p>“They don't see us! They won't see us! It's all</p>\n<p>no good!” cried Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>The two little flags on the line swayed as the</p>\n<p>nearing train shook and loosened the heaps of loose stones</p>\n<p>that held them up. One of them slowly leaned over</p>\n<p>and fell on the line. Bobbie jumped forward and caught</p>\n<p>it up, and waved it; her hands did not tremble</p>\n<p>now.</p>\n<p>It seemed that the train came on as fast as</p>",
        "<p>ever. It was very near now.</p>\n<p>“Keep off the line, you silly cuckoo!” said Peter, fiercely.</p>\n<p>“It's no good,” Bobbie said again.</p>\n<p>“Stand back!” cried Peter, suddenly, and he dragged Phyllis back</p>\n<p>by the arm.</p>\n<p>But Bobbie cried, “Not yet, not yet!” and waved her</p>\n<p>two flags right over the line. The front of the</p>",
        "<p>engine looked black and enormous. Its voice was loud and</p>\n<p>harsh.</p>\n<p>“Oh, stop, stop, stop!” cried Bobbie. No one heard her.</p>\n<p>At least Peter and Phyllis didn't, for the oncoming rush</p>\n<p>of the train covered the sound of her voice with</p>\n<p>a mountain of sound. But afterwards she used to wonder</p>\n<p>whether the engine itself had not heard her. It seemed</p>",
        "<p>almost as though it had--for it slackened swiftly, slackened and</p>\n<p>stopped, not twenty yards from the place where Bobbie's two</p>\n<p>flags waved over the line. She saw the great black</p>\n<p>engine stop dead, but somehow she could not stop waving</p>\n<p>the flags. And when the driver and the fireman had</p>\n<p>got off the engine and Peter and Phyllis had gone</p>\n<p>to meet them and pour out their excited tale of</p>",
        "<p>the awful mound just round the corner, Bobbie still waved</p>\n<p>the flags but more and more feebly and jerkily.</p>\n<p>When the others turned towards her she was lying across</p>\n<p>the line with her hands flung forward and still gripping</p>\n<p>the sticks of the little red flannel flags.</p>\n<p>The engine-driver picked her up, carried her to the train,</p>\n<p>and laid her on the cushions of a first-class carriage.</p>",
        "<p>“Gone right off in a faint,” he said, “poor little</p>\n<p>woman. And no wonder. I'll just 'ave a look at</p>\n<p>this 'ere mound of yours, and then we'll run you</p>\n<p>back to the station and get her seen to.”</p>\n<p>It was horrible to see Bobbie lying so white and</p>\n<p>quiet, with her lips blue, and parted.</p>\n<p>“I believe that's what people look like when they're dead,”</p>",
        "<p>whispered Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“DON'T!” said Peter, sharply.</p>\n<p>They sat by Bobbie on the blue cushions, and the</p>\n<p>train ran back. Before it reached their station Bobbie had</p>\n<p>sighed and opened her eyes, and rolled herself over and</p>\n<p>begun to cry. This cheered the others wonderfully. They had</p>\n<p>seen her cry before, but they had never seen her</p>",
        "<p>faint, nor anyone else, for the matter of that. They</p>\n<p>had not known what to do when she was fainting,</p>\n<p>but now she was only crying they could thump her</p>\n<p>on the back and tell her not to, just as</p>\n<p>they always did. And presently, when she stopped crying, they</p>\n<p>were able to laugh at her for being such a</p>\n<p>coward as to faint.</p>",
        "<p>When the station was reached, the three were the heroes</p>\n<p>of an agitated meeting on the platform.</p>\n<p>The praises they got for their “prompt action,” their “common</p>\n<p>sense,” their “ingenuity,” were enough to have turned anybody's head.</p>\n<p>Phyllis enjoyed herself thoroughly. She had never been a real</p>\n<p>heroine before, and the feeling was delicious. Peter's ears got</p>\n<p>very red. Yet he, too, enjoyed himself. Only Bobbie wished</p>",
        "<p>they all wouldn't. She wanted to get away.</p>\n<p>“You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect,” said</p>\n<p>the Station Master.</p>\n<p>Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again. She</p>\n<p>pulled at Peter's jacket.</p>\n<p>“Oh, come away, come away! I want to go home,”</p>\n<p>she said.</p>",
        "<p>So they went. And as they went Station Master and</p>\n<p>Porter and guards and driver and fireman and passengers sent</p>\n<p>up a cheer.</p>\n<p>“Oh, listen,” cried Phyllis; “that's for US!”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Peter. “I say, I am glad I thought</p>\n<p>about something red, and waving it.”</p>\n<p>“How lucky we DID put on our red flannel petticoats!”</p>",
        "<p>said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>Bobbie said nothing. She was thinking of the horrible mound,</p>\n<p>and the trustful train rushing towards it.</p>\n<p>“And it was US that saved them,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“How dreadful if they had all been killed!” said Phyllis;</p>\n<p>“wouldn't it, Bobbie?”</p>\n<p>“We never got any cherries, after all,” said Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>The others thought her rather heartless.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter VII.</h3>\n<p>For valour.</p>\n<p>I hope you don't mind my telling you a good</p>\n<p>deal about Roberta. The fact is I am growing very</p>\n<p>fond of her. The more I observe her the more</p>\n<p>I love her. And I notice all sorts of things</p>\n<p>about her that I like.</p>\n<p>For instance, she was quite oddly anxious to make other</p>",
        "<p>people happy. And she could keep a secret, a tolerably</p>\n<p>rare accomplishment. Also she had the power of silent sympathy.</p>\n<p>That sounds rather dull, I know, but it's not so</p>\n<p>dull as it sounds. It just means that a person</p>\n<p>is able to know that you are unhappy, and to</p>\n<p>love you extra on that account, without bothering you by</p>\n<p>telling you all the time how sorry she is for</p>",
        "<p>you. That was what Bobbie was like. She knew that</p>\n<p>Mother was unhappy--and that Mother had not told her the</p>\n<p>reason. So she just loved Mother more and never said</p>\n<p>a single word that could let Mother know how earnestly</p>\n<p>her little girl wondered what Mother was unhappy about. This</p>\n<p>needs practice. It is not so easy as you might</p>\n<p>think.</p>",
        "<p>Whatever happened--and all sorts of nice, pleasant ordinary things happened--such</p>\n<p>as picnics, games, and buns for tea, Bobbie always had</p>\n<p>these thoughts at the back of her mind. “Mother's unhappy.</p>\n<p>Why? I don't know. She doesn't want me to know.</p>\n<p>I won't try to find out. But she IS unhappy.</p>\n<p>Why? I don't know. She doesn't--” and so on, repeating</p>\n<p>and repeating like a tune that you don't know the</p>",
        "<p>stopping part of.</p>\n<p>The Russian gentleman still took up a good deal of</p>\n<p>everybody's thoughts. All the editors and secretaries of Societies and</p>\n<p>Members of Parliament had answered Mother's letters as politely as</p>\n<p>they knew how; but none of them could tell where</p>\n<p>the wife and children of Mr. Szezcpansky would be likely</p>\n<p>to be. (Did I tell you that the Russian's very</p>",
        "<p>Russian name was that?)</p>\n<p>Bobbie had another quality which you will hear differently described</p>\n<p>by different people. Some of them call it interfering in</p>\n<p>other people's business--and some call it “helping lame dogs over</p>\n<p>stiles,” and some call it “loving-kindness.” It just means trying</p>\n<p>to help people.</p>\n<p>She racked her brains to think of some way of</p>",
        "<p>helping the Russian gentleman to find his wife and children.</p>\n<p>He had learned a few words of English now. He</p>\n<p>could say “Good morning,” and “Good night,” and “Please,” and</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” and “Pretty,” when the children brought him flowers,</p>\n<p>and “Ver' good,” when they asked him how he had</p>\n<p>slept.</p>\n<p>The way he smiled when he “said his English,” was,</p>",
        "<p>Bobbie felt, “just too sweet for anything.” She used to</p>\n<p>think of his face because she fancied it would help</p>\n<p>her to some way of helping him. But it did</p>\n<p>not. Yet his being there cheered her because she saw</p>\n<p>that it made Mother happier.</p>\n<p>“She likes to have someone to be good to, even</p>\n<p>beside us,” said Bobbie. “And I know she hated to</p>",
        "<p>let him have Father's clothes. But I suppose it 'hurt</p>\n<p>nice,' or she wouldn't have.”</p>\n<p>For many and many a night after the day when</p>\n<p>she and Peter and Phyllis had saved the train from</p>\n<p>wreck by waving their little red flannel flags, Bobbie used</p>\n<p>to wake screaming and shivering, seeing again that horrible mound,</p>\n<p>and the poor, dear trustful engine rushing on towards it--just</p>",
        "<p>thinking that it was doing its swift duty, and that</p>\n<p>everything was clear and safe. And then a warm thrill</p>\n<p>of pleasure used to run through her at the remembrance</p>\n<p>of how she and Peter and Phyllis and the red</p>\n<p>flannel petticoats had really saved everybody.</p>\n<p>One morning a letter came. It was addressed to Peter</p>\n<p>and Bobbie and Phyllis. They opened it with enthusiastic curiosity,</p>",
        "<p>for they did not often get letters.</p>\n<p>The letter said:--</p>\n<p>“Dear Sir, and Ladies,--It is proposed to make a small</p>\n<p>presentation to you, in commemoration of your prompt and courageous</p>\n<p>action in warning the train on the --- inst., and</p>\n<p>thus averting what must, humanly speaking, have been a terrible</p>\n<p>accident. The presentation will take place at the --- Station</p>",
        "<p>at three o'clock on the 30th inst., if this time</p>\n<p>and place will be convenient to you.</p>\n<p>“Yours faithfully,</p>\n<p>“Jabez Inglewood. “Secretary, Great Northern and Southern Railway Co.”</p>\n<p>There never had been a prouder moment in the lives</p>\n<p>of the three children. They rushed to Mother with the</p>\n<p>letter, and she also felt proud and said so, and</p>",
        "<p>this made the children happier than ever.</p>\n<p>“But if the presentation is money, you must say, 'Thank</p>\n<p>you, but we'd rather not take it,'” said Mother. “I'll</p>\n<p>wash your Indian muslins at once,” she added. “You must</p>\n<p>look tidy on an occasion like this.”</p>\n<p>“Phil and I can wash them,” said Bobbie, “if you'll</p>\n<p>iron them, Mother.”</p>",
        "<p>Washing is rather fun. I wonder whether you've ever done</p>\n<p>it? This particular washing took place in the back kitchen,</p>\n<p>which had a stone floor and a very big stone</p>\n<p>sink under its window.</p>\n<p>“Let's put the bath on the sink,” said Phyllis; “then</p>\n<p>we can pretend we're out-of-doors washerwomen like Mother saw in</p>\n<p>France.”</p>",
        "<p>“But they were washing in the cold river,” said Peter,</p>\n<p>his hands in his pockets, “not in hot water.”</p>\n<p>“This is a HOT river, then,” said Phyllis; “lend a</p>\n<p>hand with the bath, there's a dear.”</p>\n<p>“I should like to see a deer lending a hand,”</p>\n<p>said Peter, but he lent his.</p>\n<p>“Now to rub and scrub and scrub and rub,” said</p>",
        "<p>Phyllis, hopping joyously about as Bobbie carefully carried the heavy</p>\n<p>kettle from the kitchen fire.</p>\n<p>“Oh, no!” said Bobbie, greatly shocked; “you don't rub muslin.</p>\n<p>You put the boiled soap in the hot water and</p>\n<p>make it all frothy-lathery--and then you shake the muslin and</p>\n<p>squeeze it, ever so gently, and all the dirt comes</p>\n<p>out. It's only clumsy things like tablecloths and sheets that</p>",
        "<p>have to be rubbed.”</p>\n<p>The lilac and the Gloire de Dijon roses outside the</p>\n<p>window swayed in the soft breeze.</p>\n<p>“It's a nice drying day--that's one thing,” said Bobbie, feeling</p>\n<p>very grown up. “Oh, I do wonder what wonderful feelings</p>\n<p>we shall have when we WEAR the Indian muslin dresses!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, so do I,” said Phyllis, shaking and squeezing the</p>",
        "<p>muslin in quite a professional manner.</p>\n<p>“NOW we squeeze out the soapy water. NO--we mustn't twist</p>\n<p>them--and then rinse them. I'll hold them while you and</p>\n<p>Peter empty the bath and get clean water.”</p>\n<p>“A presentation! That means presents,” said Peter, as his sisters,</p>\n<p>having duly washed the pegs and wiped the line, hung</p>\n<p>up the dresses to dry. “Whatever will it be?”</p>",
        "<p>“It might be anything,” said Phyllis; “what I've always wanted</p>\n<p>is a Baby elephant--but I suppose they wouldn't know that.”</p>\n<p>“Suppose it was gold models of steam-engines?” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Or a big model of the scene of the prevented</p>\n<p>accident,” suggested Peter, “with a little model train, and dolls</p>\n<p>dressed like us and the engine-driver and fireman and passengers.”</p>\n<p>“Do you LIKE,” said Bobbie, doubtfully, drying her hands on</p>",
        "<p>the rough towel that hung on a roller at the</p>\n<p>back of the scullery door, “do you LIKE us being</p>\n<p>rewarded for saving a train?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I do,” said Peter, downrightly; “and don't you try</p>\n<p>to come it over us that you don't like it,</p>\n<p>too. Because I know you do.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie, doubtfully, “I know I do. But oughtn't</p>",
        "<p>we to be satisfied with just having done it, and</p>\n<p>not ask for anything more?”</p>\n<p>“Who did ask for anything more, silly?” said her brother;</p>\n<p>“Victoria Cross soldiers don't ASK for it; but they're glad</p>\n<p>enough to get it all the same. Perhaps it'll be</p>\n<p>medals. Then, when I'm very old indeed, I shall show</p>\n<p>them to my grandchildren and say, 'We only did our</p>",
        "<p>duty,' and they'll be awfully proud of me.”</p>\n<p>“You have to be married,” warned Phyllis, “or you don't</p>\n<p>have any grandchildren.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose I shall HAVE to be married some day,”</p>\n<p>said Peter, “but it will be an awful bother having</p>\n<p>her round all the time. I'd like to marry a</p>\n<p>lady who had trances, and only woke up once or</p>",
        "<p>twice a year.”</p>\n<p>“Just to say you were the light of her life</p>\n<p>and then go to sleep again. Yes. That wouldn't be</p>\n<p>bad,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“When _I_ get married,” said Phyllis, “I shall want him</p>\n<p>to want me to be awake all the time, so</p>\n<p>that I can hear him say how nice I am.”</p>",
        "<p>“I think it would be nice,” said Bobbie, “to marry</p>\n<p>someone very poor, and then you'd do all the work</p>\n<p>and he'd love you most frightfully, and see the blue</p>\n<p>wood smoke curling up among the trees from the domestic</p>\n<p>hearth as he came home from work every night. I</p>\n<p>say--we've got to answer that letter and say that the</p>\n<p>time and place WILL be convenient to us. There's the</p>",
        "<p>soap, Peter. WE'RE both as clean as clean. That pink</p>\n<p>box of writing paper you had on your birthday, Phil.”</p>\n<p>It took some time to arrange what should be said.</p>\n<p>Mother had gone back to her writing, and several sheets</p>\n<p>of pink paper with scalloped gilt edges and green four-leaved</p>\n<p>shamrocks in the corner were spoiled before the three had</p>\n<p>decided what to say. Then each made a copy and</p>",
        "<p>signed it with its own name.</p>\n<p>The threefold letter ran:--</p>\n<p>“Dear Mr. Jabez Inglewood,--Thank you very much. We did not</p>\n<p>want to be rewarded but only to save the train,</p>\n<p>but we are glad you think so and thank you</p>\n<p>very much. The time and place you say will be</p>\n<p>quite convenient to us. Thank you very much.</p>",
        "<p>“Your affecate little friend,”</p>\n<p>Then came the name, and after it:--</p>\n<p>“P.S. Thank you very much.”</p>\n<p>“Washing is much easier than ironing,” said Bobbie, taking the</p>\n<p>clean dry dresses off the line. “I do love to</p>\n<p>see things come clean. Oh--I don't know how we shall</p>\n<p>wait till it's time to know what presentation they're going</p>",
        "<p>to present!”</p>\n<p>When at last--it seemed a very long time after--it was</p>\n<p>THE day, the three children went down to the station</p>\n<p>at the proper time. And everything that happened was so</p>\n<p>odd that it seemed like a dream. The Station Master</p>\n<p>came out to meet them--in his best clothes, as Peter</p>\n<p>noticed at once--and led them into the waiting room where</p>",
        "<p>once they had played the advertisement game. It looked quite</p>\n<p>different now. A carpet had been put down--and there were</p>\n<p>pots of roses on the mantelpiece and on the window</p>\n<p>ledges--green branches stuck up, like holly and laurel are at</p>\n<p>Christmas, over the framed advertisement of Cook's Tours and the</p>\n<p>Beauties of Devon and the Paris Lyons Railway. There were</p>\n<p>quite a number of people there besides the Porter--two or</p>",
        "<p>three ladies in smart dresses, and quite a crowd of</p>\n<p>gentlemen in high hats and frock coats--besides everybody who belonged</p>\n<p>to the station. They recognized several people who had been</p>\n<p>in the train on the red-flannel-petticoat day. Best of all</p>\n<p>their own old gentleman was there, and his coat and</p>\n<p>hat and collar seemed more than ever different from anyone</p>\n<p>else's. He shook hands with them and then everybody sat</p>",
        "<p>down on chairs, and a gentleman in spectacles--they found out</p>\n<p>afterwards that he was the District Superintendent--began quite a long</p>\n<p>speech--very clever indeed. I am not going to write the</p>\n<p>speech down. First, because you would think it dull; and</p>\n<p>secondly, because it made all the children blush so, and</p>\n<p>get so hot about the ears that I am quite</p>\n<p>anxious to get away from this part of the subject;</p>",
        "<p>and thirdly, because the gentleman took so many words to</p>\n<p>say what he had to say that I really haven't</p>\n<p>time to write them down. He said all sorts of</p>\n<p>nice things about the children's bravery and presence of mind,</p>\n<p>and when he had done he sat down, and everyone</p>\n<p>who was there clapped and said, “Hear, hear.”</p>\n<p>And then the old gentleman got up and said things,</p>",
        "<p>too. It was very like a prize-giving. And then he</p>\n<p>called the children one by one, by their names, and</p>\n<p>gave each of them a beautiful gold watch and chain.</p>\n<p>And inside the watches were engraved after the name of</p>\n<p>the watch's new owner:--</p>\n<p>“From the Directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in</p>\n<p>grateful recognition of the courageous and prompt action which averted</p>",
        "<p>an accident on --- 1905.”</p>\n<p>The watches were the most beautiful you can possibly imagine,</p>\n<p>and each one had a blue leather case to live</p>\n<p>in when it was at home.</p>\n<p>“You must make a speech now and thank everyone for</p>\n<p>their kindness,” whispered the Station Master in Peter's ear and</p>\n<p>pushed him forward. “Begin 'Ladies and Gentlemen,'” he added.</p>",
        "<p>Each of the children had already said “Thank you,” quite</p>\n<p>properly.</p>\n<p>“Oh, dear,” said Peter, but he did not resist the</p>\n<p>push.</p>\n<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen,” he said in a rather husky voice.</p>\n<p>Then there was a pause, and he heard his heart</p>\n<p>beating in his throat. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” he went on</p>",
        "<p>with a rush, “it's most awfully good of you, and</p>\n<p>we shall treasure the watches all our lives--but really we</p>\n<p>don't deserve it because what we did wasn't anything, really.</p>\n<p>At least, I mean it was awfully exciting, and what</p>\n<p>I mean to say--thank you all very, very much.”</p>\n<p>The people clapped Peter more than they had done the</p>\n<p>District Superintendent, and then everybody shook hands with them, and</p>",
        "<p>as soon as politeness would let them, they got away,</p>\n<p>and tore up the hill to Three Chimneys with their</p>\n<p>watches in their hands.</p>\n<p>It was a wonderful day--the kind of day that very</p>\n<p>seldom happens to anybody and to most of us not</p>\n<p>at all.</p>\n<p>“I did want to talk to the old gentleman about</p>",
        "<p>something else,” said Bobbie, “but it was so public--like being</p>\n<p>in church.”</p>\n<p>“What did you want to say?” asked Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“I'll tell you when I've thought about it more,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie.</p>\n<p>So when she had thought a little more she wrote</p>\n<p>a letter.</p>",
        "<p>“My dearest old gentleman,” it said; “I want most awfully</p>\n<p>to ask you something. If you could get out of</p>\n<p>the train and go by the next, it would do.</p>\n<p>I do not want you to give me anything. Mother</p>\n<p>says we ought not to. And besides, we do not</p>\n<p>want any THINGS. Only to talk to you about a</p>\n<p>Prisoner and Captive. Your loving little friend,</p>",
        "<p>“Bobbie.”</p>\n<p>She got the Station Master to give the letter to</p>\n<p>the old gentleman, and next day she asked Peter and</p>\n<p>Phyllis to come down to the station with her at</p>\n<p>the time when the train that brought the old gentleman</p>\n<p>from town would be passing through.</p>\n<p>She explained her idea to them--and they approved thoroughly.</p>",
        "<p>They had all washed their hands and faces, and brushed</p>\n<p>their hair, and were looking as tidy as they knew</p>\n<p>how. But Phyllis, always unlucky, had upset a jug of</p>\n<p>lemonade down the front of her dress. There was no</p>\n<p>time to change--and the wind happening to blow from the</p>\n<p>coal yard, her frock was soon powdered with grey, which</p>\n<p>stuck to the sticky lemonade stains and made her look,</p>",
        "<p>as Peter said, “like any little gutter child.”</p>\n<p>It was decided that she should keep behind the others</p>\n<p>as much as possible.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps the old gentleman won't notice,” said Bobbie. “The aged</p>\n<p>are often weak in the eyes.”</p>\n<p>There was no sign of weakness, however, in the eyes,</p>\n<p>or in any other part of the old gentleman, as</p>",
        "<p>he stepped from the train and looked up and down</p>\n<p>the platform.</p>\n<p>The three children, now that it came to the point,</p>\n<p>suddenly felt that rush of deep shyness which makes your</p>\n<p>ears red and hot, your hands warm and wet, and</p>\n<p>the tip of your nose pink and shiny.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Phyllis, “my heart's thumping like a steam-engine--right under</p>",
        "<p>my sash, too.”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense,” said Peter, “people's hearts aren't under their sashes.”</p>\n<p>“I don't care--mine is,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“If you're going to talk like a poetry-book,” said Peter,</p>\n<p>“my heart's in my mouth.”</p>\n<p>“My heart's in my boots--if you come to that,” said</p>\n<p>Roberta; “but do come on--he'll think we're idiots.”</p>",
        "<p>“He won't be far wrong,” said Peter, gloomily. And they</p>\n<p>went forward to meet the old gentleman.</p>\n<p>“Hullo,” he said, shaking hands with them all in turn.</p>\n<p>“This is a very great pleasure.”</p>\n<p>“It WAS good of you to get out,” Bobbie said,</p>\n<p>perspiring and polite.</p>\n<p>He took her arm and drew her into the waiting</p>",
        "<p>room where she and the others had played the advertisement</p>\n<p>game the day they found the Russian. Phyllis and Peter</p>\n<p>followed. “Well?” said the old gentleman, giving Bobbie's arm a</p>\n<p>kind little shake before he let it go. “Well? What</p>\n<p>is it?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, please!” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Yes?” said the old gentleman.</p>",
        "<p>“What I mean to say--” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Well?” said the old gentleman.</p>\n<p>“It's all very nice and kind,” said she.</p>\n<p>“But?” he said.</p>\n<p>“I wish I might say something,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Say it,” said he.</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” said Bobbie--and out came the story of the</p>",
        "<p>Russian who had written the beautiful book about poor people,</p>\n<p>and had been sent to prison and to Siberia for</p>\n<p>just that.</p>\n<p>“And what we want more than anything in the world</p>\n<p>is to find his wife and children for him,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie, “but we don't know how. But you must be</p>\n<p>most horribly clever, or you wouldn't be a Direction of</p>",
        "<p>the Railway. And if YOU knew how--and would? We'd rather</p>\n<p>have that than anything else in the world. We'd go</p>\n<p>without the watches, even, if you could sell them and</p>\n<p>find his wife with the money.”</p>\n<p>And the others said so, too, though not with so</p>\n<p>much enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>“Hum,” said the old gentleman, pulling down the white waistcoat</p>",
        "<p>that had the big gilt buttons on it, “what did</p>\n<p>you say the name was--Fryingpansky?”</p>\n<p>“No, no,” said Bobbie earnestly. “I'll write it down for</p>\n<p>you. It doesn't really look at all like that except</p>\n<p>when you say it. Have you a bit of pencil</p>\n<p>and the back of an envelope?” she asked.</p>\n<p>The old gentleman got out a gold pencil-case and a</p>",
        "<p>beautiful, sweet-smelling, green Russian leather note-book and opened it at</p>\n<p>a new page.</p>\n<p>“Here,” he said, “write here.”</p>\n<p>She wrote down “Szezcpansky,” and said:--</p>\n<p>“That's how you write it. You CALL it Shepansky.”</p>\n<p>The old gentleman took out a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles</p>\n<p>and fitted them on his nose. When he had read</p>",
        "<p>the name, he looked quite different.</p>\n<p>“THAT man? Bless my soul!” he said. “Why, I've read</p>\n<p>his book! It's translated into every European language. A fine</p>\n<p>book--a noble book. And so your mother took him in--like</p>\n<p>the good Samaritan. Well, well. I'll tell you what, youngsters--your</p>\n<p>mother must be a very good woman.”</p>\n<p>“Of course she is,” said Phyllis, in astonishment.</p>",
        "<p>“And you're a very good man,” said Bobbie, very shy,</p>\n<p>but firmly resolved to be polite.</p>\n<p>“You flatter me,” said the old gentleman, taking off his</p>\n<p>hat with a flourish. “And now am I to tell</p>\n<p>you what I think of you?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, please don't,” said Bobbie, hastily.</p>\n<p>“Why?” asked the old gentleman.</p>",
        "<p>“I don't exactly know,” said Bobbie. “Only--if it's horrid, I</p>\n<p>don't want you to; and if it's nice, I'd rather</p>\n<p>you didn't.”</p>\n<p>The old gentleman laughed.</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” he said, “I'll only just say that I'm</p>\n<p>very glad you came to me about this--very glad, indeed.</p>\n<p>And I shouldn't be surprised if I found out something</p>",
        "<p>very soon. I know a great many Russians in London,</p>\n<p>and every Russian knows HIS name. Now tell me all</p>\n<p>about yourselves.”</p>\n<p>He turned to the others, but there was only one</p>\n<p>other, and that was Peter. Phyllis had disappeared.</p>\n<p>“Tell me all about yourself,” said the old gentleman again.</p>\n<p>And, quite naturally, Peter was stricken dumb.</p>",
        "<p>“All right, we'll have an examination,” said the old gentleman;</p>\n<p>“you two sit on the table, and I'll sit on</p>\n<p>the bench and ask questions.”</p>\n<p>He did, and out came their names and ages--their Father's</p>\n<p>name and business--how long they had lived at Three Chimneys</p>\n<p>and a great deal more.</p>\n<p>The questions were beginning to turn on a herring and</p>",
        "<p>a half for three halfpence, and a pound of lead</p>\n<p>and a pound of feathers, when the door of the</p>\n<p>waiting room was kicked open by a boot; as the</p>\n<p>boot entered everyone could see that its lace was coming</p>\n<p>undone--and in came Phyllis, very slowly and carefully.</p>\n<p>In one hand she carried a large tin can, and</p>\n<p>in the other a thick slice of bread and butter.</p>",
        "<p>“Afternoon tea,” she announced proudly, and held the can and</p>\n<p>the bread and butter out to the old gentleman, who</p>\n<p>took them and said:--</p>\n<p>“Bless my soul!”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“It's very thoughtful of you,” said the old gentleman, “very.”</p>\n<p>“But you might have got a cup,” said Bobbie, “and</p>",
        "<p>a plate.”</p>\n<p>“Perks always drinks out of the can,” said Phyllis, flushing</p>\n<p>red. “I think it was very nice of him to</p>\n<p>give it me at all--let alone cups and plates,” she</p>\n<p>added.</p>\n<p>“So do I,” said the old gentleman, and he drank</p>\n<p>some of the tea and tasted the bread and butter.</p>",
        "<p>And then it was time for the next train, and</p>\n<p>he got into it with many good-byes and kind last</p>\n<p>words.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said Peter, when they were left on the platform,</p>\n<p>and the tail-lights of the train disappeared round the corner,</p>\n<p>“it's my belief that we've lighted a candle to-day--like Latimer,</p>\n<p>you know, when he was being burned--and there'll be fireworks</p>",
        "<p>for our Russian before long.”</p>\n<p>And so there were.</p>\n<p>It wasn't ten days after the interview in the waiting</p>\n<p>room that the three children were sitting on the top</p>\n<p>of the biggest rock in the field below their house</p>\n<p>watching the 5.15 steam away from the station along the</p>\n<p>bottom of the valley. They saw, too, the few people</p>",
        "<p>who had got out at the station straggling up the</p>\n<p>road towards the village--and they saw one person leave the</p>\n<p>road and open the gate that led across the fields</p>\n<p>to Three Chimneys and to nowhere else.</p>\n<p>“Who on earth!” said Peter, scrambling down.</p>\n<p>“Let's go and see,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>So they did. And when they got near enough to</p>",
        "<p>see who the person was, they saw it was their</p>\n<p>old gentleman himself, his brass buttons winking in the afternoon</p>\n<p>sunshine, and his white waistcoat looking whiter than ever against</p>\n<p>the green of the field.</p>\n<p>“Hullo!” shouted the children, waving their hands.</p>\n<p>“Hullo!” shouted the old gentleman, waving his hat.</p>\n<p>Then the three started to run--and when they got to</p>",
        "<p>him they hardly had breath left to say:--</p>\n<p>“How do you do?”</p>\n<p>“Good news,” said he. “I've found your Russian friend's wife</p>\n<p>and child--and I couldn't resist the temptation of giving myself</p>\n<p>the pleasure of telling him.”</p>\n<p>But as he looked at Bobbie's face he felt that</p>\n<p>he COULD resist that temptation.</p>",
        "<p>“Here,” he said to her, “you run on and tell</p>\n<p>him. The other two will show me the way.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie ran. But when she had breathlessly panted out the</p>\n<p>news to the Russian and Mother sitting in the quiet</p>\n<p>garden--when Mother's face had lighted up so beautifully, and she</p>\n<p>had said half a dozen quick French words to the</p>\n<p>Exile--Bobbie wished that she had NOT carried the news. For</p>",
        "<p>the Russian sprang up with a cry that made Bobbie's</p>\n<p>heart leap and then tremble--a cry of love and longing</p>\n<p>such as she had never heard. Then he took Mother's</p>\n<p>hand and kissed it gently and reverently--and then he sank</p>\n<p>down in his chair and covered his face with his</p>\n<p>hands and sobbed. Bobbie crept away. She did not want</p>\n<p>to see the others just then.</p>",
        "<p>But she was as gay as anybody when the endless</p>\n<p>French talking was over, when Peter had torn down to</p>\n<p>the village for buns and cakes, and the girls had</p>\n<p>got tea ready and taken it out into the garden.</p>\n<p>The old gentleman was most merry and delightful. He seemed</p>\n<p>to be able to talk in French and English almost</p>\n<p>at the same moment, and Mother did nearly as well.</p>",
        "<p>It was a delightful time. Mother seemed as if she</p>\n<p>could not make enough fuss about the old gentleman, and</p>\n<p>she said yes at once when he asked if he</p>\n<p>might present some “goodies” to his little friends.</p>\n<p>The word was new to the children--but they guessed that</p>\n<p>it meant sweets, for the three large pink and green</p>\n<p>boxes, tied with green ribbon, which he took out of</p>",
        "<p>his bag, held unheard-of layers of beautiful chocolates.</p>\n<p>The Russian's few belongings were packed, and they all saw</p>\n<p>him off at the station.</p>\n<p>Then Mother turned to the old gentleman and said:--</p>\n<p>“I don't know how to thank you for EVERYTHING. It</p>\n<p>has been a real pleasure to me to see you.</p>\n<p>But we live very quietly. I am so sorry that</p>",
        "<p>I can't ask you to come and see us again.”</p>\n<p>The children thought this very hard. When they HAD made</p>\n<p>a friend--and such a friend--they would dearly have liked him</p>\n<p>to come and see them again.</p>\n<p>What the old gentleman thought they couldn't tell. He only</p>\n<p>said:--</p>\n<p>“I consider myself very fortunate, Madam, to have been received</p>",
        "<p>once at your house.”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said Mother, “I know I must seem surly and</p>\n<p>ungrateful--but--”</p>\n<p>“You could never seem anything but a most charming and</p>\n<p>gracious lady,” said the old gentleman, with another of his</p>\n<p>bows.</p>\n<p>And as they turned to go up the hill, Bobbie</p>",
        "<p>saw her Mother's face.</p>\n<p>“How tired you look, Mammy,” she said; “lean on me.”</p>\n<p>“It's my place to give Mother my arm,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“I'm the head man of the family when Father's away.”</p>\n<p>Mother took an arm of each.</p>\n<p>“How awfully nice,” said Phyllis, skipping joyfully, “to think of</p>\n<p>the dear Russian embracing his long-lost wife. The baby must</p>",
        "<p>have grown a lot since he saw it.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mother.</p>\n<p>“I wonder whether Father will think I'VE grown,” Phyllis went</p>\n<p>on, skipping still more gaily. “I have grown already, haven't</p>\n<p>I, Mother?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mother, “oh, yes,” and Bobbie and Peter felt</p>\n<p>her hands tighten on their arms.</p>",
        "<p>“Poor old Mammy, you ARE tired,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>Bobbie said, “Come on, Phil; I'll race you to the</p>\n<p>gate.”</p>\n<p>And she started the race, though she hated doing it.</p>\n<p>YOU know why Bobbie did that. Mother only thought that</p>\n<p>Bobbie was tired of walking slowly. Even Mothers, who love</p>\n<p>you better than anyone else ever will, don't always understand.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter VIII.</h3>\n<p>The amateur firemen.</p>\n<p>“That's a likely little brooch you've got on, Miss,” said</p>\n<p>Perks the Porter; “I don't know as ever I see</p>\n<p>a thing more like a buttercup without it WAS a</p>\n<p>buttercup.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie, glad and flushed by this approval. “I</p>\n<p>always thought it was more like a buttercup almost than</p>",
        "<p>even a real one--and I NEVER thought it would come</p>\n<p>to be mine, my very own--and then Mother gave it</p>\n<p>to me for my birthday.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, have you had a birthday?” said Perks; and he</p>\n<p>seemed quite surprised, as though a birthday were a thing</p>\n<p>only granted to a favoured few.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie; “when's your birthday, Mr. Perks?” The children</p>",
        "<p>were taking tea with Mr. Perks in the Porters' room</p>\n<p>among the lamps and the railway almanacs. They had brought</p>\n<p>their own cups and some jam turnovers. Mr. Perks made</p>\n<p>tea in a beer can, as usual, and everyone felt</p>\n<p>very happy and confidential.</p>\n<p>“My birthday?” said Perks, tipping some more dark brown tea</p>\n<p>out of the can into Peter's cup. “I give up</p>",
        "<p>keeping of my birthday afore you was born.”</p>\n<p>“But you must have been born SOMETIME, you know,” said</p>\n<p>Phyllis, thoughtfully, “even if it was twenty years ago--or thirty</p>\n<p>or sixty or seventy.”</p>\n<p>“Not so long as that, Missie,” Perks grinned as he</p>\n<p>answered. “If you really want to know, it was thirty-two</p>\n<p>years ago, come the fifteenth of this month.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then why don't you keep it?” asked Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“I've got something else to keep besides birthdays,” said Perks,</p>\n<p>briefly.</p>\n<p>“Oh! What?” asked Phyllis, eagerly. “Not secrets?”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Perks, “the kids and the Missus.”</p>\n<p>It was this talk that set the children thinking, and,</p>\n<p>presently, talking. Perks was, on the whole, the dearest friend</p>",
        "<p>they had made. Not so grand as the Station Master,</p>\n<p>but more approachable--less powerful than the old gentleman, but more</p>\n<p>confidential.</p>\n<p>“It seems horrid that nobody keeps his birthday,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Couldn't WE do something?”</p>\n<p>“Let's go up to the Canal bridge and talk it</p>\n<p>over,” said Peter. “I got a new gut line from</p>",
        "<p>the postman this morning. He gave it me for a</p>\n<p>bunch of roses that I gave him for his sweetheart.</p>\n<p>She's ill.”</p>\n<p>“Then I do think you might have given her the</p>\n<p>roses for nothing,” said Bobbie, indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Nyang, nyang!” said Peter, disagreeably, and put his hands in</p>\n<p>his pockets.</p>",
        "<p>“He did, of course,” said Phyllis, in haste; “directly we</p>\n<p>heard she was ill we got the roses ready and</p>\n<p>waited by the gate. It was when you were making</p>\n<p>the brekker-toast. And when he'd said 'Thank you' for the</p>\n<p>roses so many times--much more than he need have--he pulled</p>\n<p>out the line and gave it to Peter. It wasn't</p>\n<p>exchange. It was the grateful heart.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, I BEG your pardon, Peter,” said Bobbie, “I AM</p>\n<p>so sorry.”</p>\n<p>“Don't mention it,” said Peter, grandly, “I knew you would</p>\n<p>be.”</p>\n<p>So then they all went up to the Canal bridge.</p>\n<p>The idea was to fish from the bridge, but the</p>\n<p>line was not quite long enough.</p>",
        "<p>“Never mind,” said Bobbie. “Let's just stay here and look</p>\n<p>at things. Everything's so beautiful.”</p>\n<p>It was. The sun was setting in red splendour over</p>\n<p>the grey and purple hills, and the canal lay smooth</p>\n<p>and shiny in the shadow--no ripple broke its surface. It</p>\n<p>was like a grey satin ribbon between the dusky green</p>\n<p>silk of the meadows that were on each side of</p>",
        "<p>its banks.</p>\n<p>“It's all right,” said Peter, “but somehow I can always</p>\n<p>see how pretty things are much better when I've something</p>\n<p>to do. Let's get down on to the towpath and</p>\n<p>fish from there.”</p>\n<p>Phyllis and Bobbie remembered how the boys on the canal-boats</p>\n<p>had thrown coal at them, and they said so.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, nonsense,” said Peter. “There aren't any boys here now.</p>\n<p>If there were, I'd fight them.”</p>\n<p>Peter's sisters were kind enough not to remind him how</p>\n<p>he had NOT fought the boys when coal had last</p>\n<p>been thrown. Instead they said, “All right, then,” and cautiously</p>\n<p>climbed down the steep bank to the towing-path. The line</p>\n<p>was carefully baited, and for half an hour they fished</p>",
        "<p>patiently and in vain. Not a single nibble came to</p>\n<p>nourish hope in their hearts.</p>\n<p>All eyes were intent on the sluggish waters that earnestly</p>\n<p>pretended they had never harboured a single minnow when a</p>\n<p>loud rough shout made them start.</p>\n<p>“Hi!” said the shout, in most disagreeable tones, “get out</p>\n<p>of that, can't you?”</p>",
        "<p>An old white horse coming along the towing-path was within</p>\n<p>half a dozen yards of them. They sprang to their</p>\n<p>feet and hastily climbed up the bank.</p>\n<p>“We'll slip down again when they've gone by,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>But, alas, the barge, after the manner of barges, stopped</p>\n<p>under the bridge.</p>\n<p>“She's going to anchor,” said Peter; “just our luck!”</p>",
        "<p>The barge did not anchor, because an anchor is not</p>\n<p>part of a canal-boat's furniture, but she was moored with</p>\n<p>ropes fore and aft--and the ropes were made fast to</p>\n<p>the palings and to crowbars driven into the ground.</p>\n<p>“What you staring at?” growled the Bargee, crossly.</p>\n<p>“We weren't staring,” said Bobbie; “we wouldn't be so rude.”</p>\n<p>“Rude be blessed,” said the man; “get along with you!”</p>",
        "<p>“Get along yourself,” said Peter. He remembered what he had</p>\n<p>said about fighting boys, and, besides, he felt safe halfway</p>\n<p>up the bank. “We've as much right here as anyone</p>\n<p>else.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, 'AVE you, indeed!” said the man. “We'll soon see</p>\n<p>about that.” And he came across his deck and began</p>\n<p>to climb down the side of his barge.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, come away, Peter, come away!” said Bobbie and Phyllis,</p>\n<p>in agonised unison.</p>\n<p>“Not me,” said Peter, “but YOU'D better.”</p>\n<p>The girls climbed to the top of the bank and</p>\n<p>stood ready to bolt for home as soon as they</p>\n<p>saw their brother out of danger. The way home lay</p>\n<p>all down hill. They knew that they all ran well.</p>",
        "<p>The Bargee did not look as if HE did. He</p>\n<p>was red-faced, heavy, and beefy.</p>\n<p>But as soon as his foot was on the towing-path</p>\n<p>the children saw that they had misjudged him.</p>\n<p>He made one spring up the bank and caught Peter</p>\n<p>by the leg, dragged him down--set him on his feet</p>\n<p>with a shake--took him by the ear--and said sternly:--</p>",
        "<p>“Now, then, what do you mean by it? Don't you</p>\n<p>know these 'ere waters is preserved? You ain't no right</p>\n<p>catching fish 'ere--not to say nothing of your precious cheek.”</p>\n<p>Peter was always proud afterwards when he remembered that, with</p>\n<p>the Bargee's furious fingers tightening on his ear, the Bargee's</p>\n<p>crimson countenance close to his own, the Bargee's hot breath</p>\n<p>on his neck, he had the courage to speak the</p>",
        "<p>truth.</p>\n<p>“I WASN'T catching fish,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“That's not YOUR fault, I'll be bound,” said the man,</p>\n<p>giving Peter's ear a twist--not a hard one--but still a</p>\n<p>twist.</p>\n<p>Peter could not say that it was. Bobbie and Phyllis</p>\n<p>had been holding on to the railings above and skipping</p>",
        "<p>with anxiety. Now suddenly Bobbie slipped through the railings and</p>\n<p>rushed down the bank towards Peter, so impetuously that Phyllis,</p>\n<p>following more temperately, felt certain that her sister's descent would</p>\n<p>end in the waters of the canal. And so it</p>\n<p>would have done if the Bargee hadn't let go of</p>\n<p>Peter's ear--and caught her in his jerseyed arm.</p>\n<p>“Who are you a-shoving of?” he said, setting her on</p>",
        "<p>her feet.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Bobbie, breathless, “I'm not shoving anybody. At least,</p>\n<p>not on purpose. Please don't be cross with Peter. Of</p>\n<p>course, if it's your canal, we're sorry and we won't</p>\n<p>any more. But we didn't know it was yours.”</p>\n<p>“Go along with you,” said the Bargee.</p>\n<p>“Yes, we will; indeed we will,” said Bobbie, earnestly; “but</p>",
        "<p>we do beg your pardon--and really we haven't caught a</p>\n<p>single fish. I'd tell you directly if we had, honour</p>\n<p>bright I would.”</p>\n<p>She held out her hands and Phyllis turned out her</p>\n<p>little empty pocket to show that really they hadn't any</p>\n<p>fish concealed about them.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the Bargee, more gently, “cut along, then, and</p>",
        "<p>don't you do it again, that's all.”</p>\n<p>The children hurried up the bank.</p>\n<p>“Chuck us a coat, M'ria,” shouted the man. And a</p>\n<p>red-haired woman in a green plaid shawl came out from</p>\n<p>the cabin door with a baby in her arms and</p>\n<p>threw a coat to him. He put it on, climbed</p>\n<p>the bank, and slouched along across the bridge towards the</p>",
        "<p>village.</p>\n<p>“You'll find me up at the 'Rose and Crown' when</p>\n<p>you've got the kid to sleep,” he called to her</p>\n<p>from the bridge.</p>\n<p>When he was out of sight the children slowly returned.</p>\n<p>Peter insisted on this.</p>\n<p>“The canal may belong to him,” he said, “though I</p>",
        "<p>don't believe it does. But the bridge is everybody's. Doctor</p>\n<p>Forrest told me it's public property. I'm not going to</p>\n<p>be bounced off the bridge by him or anyone else,</p>\n<p>so I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Peter's ear was still sore and so were his feelings.</p>\n<p>The girls followed him as gallant soldiers might follow the</p>\n<p>leader of a forlorn hope.</p>",
        "<p>“I do wish you wouldn't,” was all they said.</p>\n<p>“Go home if you're afraid,” said Peter; “leave me alone.</p>\n<p>I'M not afraid.”</p>\n<p>The sound of the man's footsteps died away along the</p>\n<p>quiet road. The peace of the evening was not broken</p>\n<p>by the notes of the sedge-warblers or by the voice</p>\n<p>of the woman in the barge, singing her baby to</p>",
        "<p>sleep. It was a sad song she sang. Something about</p>\n<p>Bill Bailey and how she wanted him to come home.</p>\n<p>The children stood leaning their arms on the parapet of</p>\n<p>the bridge; they were glad to be quiet for a</p>\n<p>few minutes because all three hearts were beating much more</p>\n<p>quickly.</p>\n<p>“I'm not going to be driven away by any old</p>",
        "<p>bargeman, I'm not,” said Peter, thickly.</p>\n<p>“Of course not,” Phyllis said soothingly; “you didn't give in</p>\n<p>to him! So now we might go home, don't you</p>\n<p>think?”</p>\n<p>“NO,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>Nothing more was said till the woman got off the</p>\n<p>barge, climbed the bank, and came across the bridge.</p>",
        "<p>She hesitated, looking at the three backs of the children,</p>\n<p>then she said, “Ahem.”</p>\n<p>Peter stayed as he was, but the girls looked round.</p>\n<p>“You mustn't take no notice of my Bill,” said the</p>\n<p>woman; “'is bark's worse'n 'is bite. Some of the kids</p>\n<p>down Farley way is fair terrors. It was them put</p>\n<p>'is back up calling out about who ate the puppy-pie</p>",
        "<p>under Marlow bridge.”</p>\n<p>“Who DID?” asked Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“_I_ dunno,” said the woman. “Nobody don't know! But somehow,</p>\n<p>and I don't know the why nor the wherefore of</p>\n<p>it, them words is p'ison to a barge-master. Don't you</p>\n<p>take no notice. 'E won't be back for two hours</p>\n<p>good. You might catch a power o' fish afore that.</p>",
        "<p>The light's good an' all,” she added.</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” said Bobbie. “You're very kind. Where's your baby?”</p>\n<p>“Asleep in the cabin,” said the woman. “'E's all right.</p>\n<p>Never wakes afore twelve. Reg'lar as a church clock, 'e</p>\n<p>is.”</p>\n<p>“I'm sorry,” said Bobbie; “I would have liked to see</p>\n<p>him, close to.”</p>",
        "<p>“And a finer you never did see, Miss, though I</p>\n<p>says it.” The woman's face brightened as she spoke.</p>\n<p>“Aren't you afraid to leave it?” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Lor' love you, no,” said the woman; “who'd hurt a</p>\n<p>little thing like 'im? Besides, Spot's there. So long!”</p>\n<p>The woman went away.</p>\n<p>“Shall we go home?” said Phyllis.</p>",
        "<p>“You can. I'm going to fish,” said Peter briefly.</p>\n<p>“I thought we came up here to talk about Perks's</p>\n<p>birthday,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Perks's birthday'll keep.”</p>\n<p>So they got down on the towing-path again and Peter</p>\n<p>fished. He did not catch anything.</p>\n<p>It was almost quite dark, the girls were getting tired,</p>",
        "<p>and as Bobbie said, it was past bedtime, when suddenly</p>\n<p>Phyllis cried, “What's that?”</p>\n<p>And she pointed to the canal boat. Smoke was coming</p>\n<p>from the chimney of the cabin, had indeed been curling</p>\n<p>softly into the soft evening air all the time--but now</p>\n<p>other wreaths of smoke were rising, and these were from</p>\n<p>the cabin door.</p>",
        "<p>“It's on fire--that's all,” said Peter, calmly. “Serve him right.”</p>\n<p>“Oh--how CAN you?” cried Phyllis. “Think of the poor dear</p>\n<p>dog.”</p>\n<p>“The BABY!” screamed Bobbie.</p>\n<p>In an instant all three made for the barge.</p>\n<p>Her mooring ropes were slack, and the little breeze, hardly</p>\n<p>strong enough to be felt, had yet been strong enough</p>",
        "<p>to drift her stern against the bank. Bobbie was first--then</p>\n<p>came Peter, and it was Peter who slipped and fell.</p>\n<p>He went into the canal up to his neck, and</p>\n<p>his feet could not feel the bottom, but his arm</p>\n<p>was on the edge of the barge. Phyllis caught at</p>\n<p>his hair. It hurt, but it helped him to get</p>\n<p>out. Next minute he had leaped on to the barge,</p>",
        "<p>Phyllis following.</p>\n<p>“Not you!” he shouted to Bobbie; “ME, because I'm wet.”</p>\n<p>He caught up with Bobbie at the cabin door, and</p>\n<p>flung her aside very roughly indeed; if they had been</p>\n<p>playing, such roughness would have made Bobbie weep with tears</p>\n<p>of rage and pain. Now, though he flung her on</p>\n<p>to the edge of the hold, so that her knee</p>",
        "<p>and her elbow were grazed and bruised, she only cried:--</p>\n<p>“No--not you--ME,” and struggled up again. But not quickly enough.</p>\n<p>Peter had already gone down two of the cabin steps</p>\n<p>into the cloud of thick smoke. He stopped, remembered all</p>\n<p>he had ever heard of fires, pulled his soaked handkerchief</p>\n<p>out of his breast pocket and tied it over his</p>\n<p>mouth. As he pulled it out he said:--</p>",
        "<p>“It's all right, hardly any fire at all.”</p>\n<p>And this, though he thought it was a lie, was</p>\n<p>rather good of Peter. It was meant to keep Bobbie</p>\n<p>from rushing after him into danger. Of course it didn't.</p>\n<p>The cabin glowed red. A paraffin lamp was burning calmly</p>\n<p>in an orange mist.</p>\n<p>“Hi,” said Peter, lifting the handkerchief from his mouth for</p>",
        "<p>a moment. “Hi, Baby--where are you?” He choked.</p>\n<p>“Oh, let ME go,” cried Bobbie, close behind him. Peter</p>\n<p>pushed her back more roughly than before, and went on.</p>\n<p>Now what would have happened if the baby hadn't cried</p>\n<p>I don't know--but just at that moment it DID cry.</p>\n<p>Peter felt his way through the dark smoke, found something</p>\n<p>small and soft and warm and alive, picked it up</p>",
        "<p>and backed out, nearly tumbling over Bobbie who was close</p>\n<p>behind. A dog snapped at his leg--tried to bark, choked.</p>\n<p>“I've got the kid,” said Peter, tearing off the handkerchief</p>\n<p>and staggering on to the deck.</p>\n<p>Bobbie caught at the place where the bark came from,</p>\n<p>and her hands met on the fat back of a</p>\n<p>smooth-haired dog. It turned and fastened its teeth on her</p>",
        "<p>hand, but very gently, as much as to say:--</p>\n<p>“I'm bound to bark and bite if strangers come into</p>\n<p>my master's cabin, but I know you mean well, so</p>\n<p>I won't REALLY bite.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie dropped the dog.</p>\n<p>“All right, old man. Good dog,” said she. “Here--give me</p>\n<p>the baby, Peter; you're so wet you'll give it cold.”</p>",
        "<p>Peter was only too glad to hand over the strange</p>\n<p>little bundle that squirmed and whimpered in his arms.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Bobbie, quickly, “you run straight to the 'Rose</p>\n<p>and Crown' and tell them. Phil and I will stay</p>\n<p>here with the precious. Hush, then, a dear, a duck,</p>\n<p>a darling! Go NOW, Peter! Run!”</p>\n<p>“I can't run in these things,” said Peter, firmly; “they're</p>",
        "<p>as heavy as lead. I'll walk.”</p>\n<p>“Then I'LL run,” said Bobbie. “Get on the bank, Phil,</p>\n<p>and I'll hand you the dear.”</p>\n<p>The baby was carefully handed. Phyllis sat down on the</p>\n<p>bank and tried to hush the baby. Peter wrung the</p>\n<p>water from his sleeves and knickerbocker legs as well as</p>\n<p>he could, and it was Bobbie who ran like the</p>",
        "<p>wind across the bridge and up the long white quiet</p>\n<p>twilight road towards the 'Rose and Crown.'</p>\n<p>There is a nice old-fashioned room at the 'Rose and</p>\n<p>Crown; where Bargees and their wives sit of an evening</p>\n<p>drinking their supper beer, and toasting their supper cheese at</p>\n<p>a glowing basketful of coals that sticks out into the</p>\n<p>room under a great hooded chimney and is warmer and</p>",
        "<p>prettier and more comforting than any other fireplace _I_ ever</p>\n<p>saw.</p>\n<p>There was a pleasant party of barge people round the</p>\n<p>fire. You might not have thought it pleasant, but they</p>\n<p>did; for they were all friends or acquaintances, and they</p>\n<p>liked the same sort of things, and talked the same</p>\n<p>sort of talk. This is the real secret of pleasant</p>",
        "<p>society. The Bargee Bill, whom the children had found so</p>\n<p>disagreeable, was considered excellent company by his mates. He was</p>\n<p>telling a tale of his own wrongs--always a thrilling subject.</p>\n<p>It was his barge he was speaking about.</p>\n<p>“And 'e sent down word 'paint her inside hout,' not</p>\n<p>namin' no colour, d'ye see? So I gets a lotter</p>\n<p>green paint and I paints her stem to stern, and</p>",
        "<p>I tell yer she looked A1. Then 'E comes along</p>\n<p>and 'e says, 'Wot yer paint 'er all one colour</p>\n<p>for?' 'e says. And I says, says I, 'Cause I</p>\n<p>thought she'd look fust-rate,' says I, 'and I think so</p>\n<p>still.' An' he says, 'DEW yer? Then ye can just</p>\n<p>pay for the bloomin' paint yerself,' says he. An' I</p>\n<p>'ad to, too.” A murmur of sympathy ran round the</p>",
        "<p>room. Breaking noisily in on it came Bobbie. She burst</p>\n<p>open the swing door--crying breathlessly:--</p>\n<p>“Bill! I want Bill the Bargeman.”</p>\n<p>There was a stupefied silence. Pots of beer were held</p>\n<p>in mid-air, paralysed on their way to thirsty mouths.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Bobbie, seeing the bargewoman and making for her.</p>\n<p>“Your barge cabin's on fire. Go quickly.”</p>",
        "<p>The woman started to her feet, and put a big</p>\n<p>red hand to her waist, on the left side, where</p>\n<p>your heart seems to be when you are frightened or</p>\n<p>miserable.</p>\n<p>“Reginald Horace!” she cried in a terrible voice; “my Reginald</p>\n<p>Horace!”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said Bobbie, “if you mean the baby; got</p>",
        "<p>him out safe. Dog, too.” She had no breath for</p>\n<p>more, except, “Go on--it's all alight.”</p>\n<p>Then she sank on the ale-house bench and tried to</p>\n<p>get that breath of relief after running which people call</p>\n<p>the 'second wind.' But she felt as though she would</p>\n<p>never breathe again.</p>\n<p>Bill the Bargee rose slowly and heavily. But his wife</p>",
        "<p>was a hundred yards up the road before he had</p>\n<p>quite understood what was the matter.</p>\n<p>Phyllis, shivering by the canal side, had hardly heard the</p>\n<p>quick approaching feet before the woman had flung herself on</p>\n<p>the railing, rolled down the bank, and snatched the baby</p>\n<p>from her.</p>\n<p>“Don't,” said Phyllis, reproachfully; “I'd just got him to sleep.”</p>",
        "<p>* * * * * *</p>\n<p>Bill came up later talking in a language with which</p>\n<p>the children were wholly unfamiliar. He leaped on to the</p>\n<p>barge and dipped up pails of water. Peter helped him</p>\n<p>and they put out the fire. Phyllis, the bargewoman, and</p>\n<p>the baby--and presently Bobbie, too--cuddled together in a heap on</p>\n<p>the bank.</p>",
        "<p>“Lord help me, if it was me left anything as</p>\n<p>could catch alight,” said the woman again and again.</p>\n<p>But it wasn't she. It was Bill the Bargeman, who</p>\n<p>had knocked his pipe out and the red ash had</p>\n<p>fallen on the hearth-rug and smouldered there and at last</p>\n<p>broken into flame. Though a stern man he was just.</p>\n<p>He did not blame his wife for what was his</p>",
        "<p>own fault, as many bargemen, and other men, too, would</p>\n<p>have done.</p>\n<p>* * * * * *</p>\n<p>Mother was half wild with anxiety when at last the</p>\n<p>three children turned up at Three Chimneys, all very wet</p>\n<p>by now, for Peter seemed to have come off on</p>\n<p>the others. But when she had disentangled the truth of</p>",
        "<p>what had happened from their mixed and incoherent narrative, she</p>\n<p>owned that they had done quite right, and could not</p>\n<p>possibly have done otherwise. Nor did she put any obstacles</p>\n<p>in the way of their accepting the cordial invitation with</p>\n<p>which the bargeman had parted from them.</p>\n<p>“Ye be here at seven to-morrow,” he had said, “and</p>\n<p>I'll take you the entire trip to Farley and back,</p>",
        "<p>so I will, and not a penny to pay. Nineteen</p>\n<p>locks!”</p>\n<p>They did not know what locks were; but they were</p>\n<p>at the bridge at seven, with bread and cheese and</p>\n<p>half a soda cake, and quite a quarter of a</p>\n<p>leg of mutton in a basket.</p>\n<p>It was a glorious day. The old white horse strained</p>",
        "<p>at the ropes, the barge glided smoothly and steadily through</p>\n<p>the still water. The sky was blue overhead. Mr. Bill</p>\n<p>was as nice as anyone could possibly be. No one</p>\n<p>would have thought that he could be the same man</p>\n<p>who had held Peter by the ear. As for Mrs.</p>\n<p>Bill, she had always been nice, as Bobbie said, and</p>\n<p>so had the baby, and even Spot, who might have</p>",
        "<p>bitten them quite badly if he had liked.</p>\n<p>“It was simply ripping, Mother,” said Peter, when they reached</p>\n<p>home very happy, very tired, and very dirty, “right over</p>\n<p>that glorious aqueduct. And locks--you don't know what they're like.</p>\n<p>You sink into the ground and then, when you feel</p>\n<p>you're never going to stop going down, two great black</p>\n<p>gates open slowly, slowly--you go out, and there you are</p>",
        "<p>on the canal just like you were before.”</p>\n<p>“I know,” said Mother, “there are locks on the Thames.</p>\n<p>Father and I used to go on the river at</p>\n<p>Marlow before we were married.”</p>\n<p>“And the dear, darling, ducky baby,” said Bobbie; “it let</p>\n<p>me nurse it for ages and ages--and it WAS so</p>\n<p>good. Mother, I wish we had a baby to play</p>",
        "<p>with.”</p>\n<p>“And everybody was so nice to us,” said Phyllis, “everybody</p>\n<p>we met. And they say we may fish whenever we</p>\n<p>like. And Bill is going to show us the way</p>\n<p>next time he's in these parts. He says we don't</p>\n<p>know really.”</p>\n<p>“He said YOU didn't know,” said Peter; “but, Mother, he</p>",
        "<p>said he'd tell all the bargees up and down the</p>\n<p>canal that we were the real, right sort, and they</p>\n<p>were to treat us like good pals, as we were.”</p>\n<p>“So then I said,” Phyllis interrupted, “we'd always each wear</p>\n<p>a red ribbon when we went fishing by the canal,</p>\n<p>so they'd know it was US, and we were the</p>\n<p>real, right sort, and be nice to us!”</p>",
        "<p>“So you've made another lot of friends,” said Mother; “first</p>\n<p>the railway and then the canal!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes,” said Bobbie; “I think everyone in the world</p>\n<p>is friends if you can only get them to see</p>\n<p>you don't want to be UN-friends.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you're right,” said Mother; and she sighed. “Come, Chicks.</p>\n<p>It's bedtime.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” said Phyllis. “Oh dear--and we went up there to</p>\n<p>talk about what we'd do for Perks's birthday. And we</p>\n<p>haven't talked a single thing about it!”</p>\n<p>“No more we have,” said Bobbie; “but Peter's saved Reginald</p>\n<p>Horace's life. I think that's about good enough for one</p>\n<p>evening.”</p>\n<p>“Bobbie would have saved him if I hadn't knocked her</p>",
        "<p>down; twice I did,” said Peter, loyally.</p>\n<p>“So would I,” said Phyllis, “if I'd known what to</p>\n<p>do.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mother, “you've saved a little child's life. I</p>\n<p>do think that's enough for one evening. Oh, my darlings,</p>\n<p>thank God YOU'RE all safe!”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter IX.</h3>\n<p>The pride of Perks.</p>\n<p>It was breakfast-time. Mother's face was very bright as she</p>\n<p>poured the milk and ladled out the porridge.</p>\n<p>“I've sold another story, Chickies,” she said; “the one about</p>\n<p>the King of the Mussels, so there'll be buns for</p>\n<p>tea. You can go and get them as soon as</p>\n<p>they're baked. About eleven, isn't it?”</p>",
        "<p>Peter, Phyllis, and Bobbie exchanged glances with each other, six</p>\n<p>glances in all. Then Bobbie said:--</p>\n<p>“Mother, would you mind if we didn't have the buns</p>\n<p>for tea to-night, but on the fifteenth? That's next Thursday.”</p>\n<p>“_I_ don't mind when you have them, dear,” said Mother,</p>\n<p>“but why?”</p>\n<p>“Because it's Perks's birthday,” said Bobbie; “he's thirty-two, and he</p>",
        "<p>says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, because he's</p>\n<p>got other things to keep--not rabbits or secrets--but the kids</p>\n<p>and the missus.”</p>\n<p>“You mean his wife and children,” said Mother.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Phyllis; “it's the same thing, isn't it?”</p>\n<p>“And we thought we'd make a nice birthday for him.</p>\n<p>He's been so awfully jolly decent to us, you know,</p>",
        "<p>Mother,” said Peter, “and we agreed that next bun-day we'd</p>\n<p>ask you if we could.”</p>\n<p>“But suppose there hadn't been a bun-day before the fifteenth?”</p>\n<p>said Mother.</p>\n<p>“Oh, then, we meant to ask you to let us</p>\n<p>anti--antipate it, and go without when the bun-day came.”</p>\n<p>“Anticipate,” said Mother. “I see. Certainly. It would be nice</p>",
        "<p>to put his name on the buns with pink sugar,</p>\n<p>wouldn't it?”</p>\n<p>“Perks,” said Peter, “it's not a pretty name.”</p>\n<p>“His other name's Albert,” said Phyllis; “I asked him once.”</p>\n<p>“We might put A. P.,” said Mother; “I'll show you</p>\n<p>how when the day comes.”</p>\n<p>This was all very well as far as it went.</p>",
        "<p>But even fourteen halfpenny buns with A. P. on them</p>\n<p>in pink sugar do not of themselves make a very</p>\n<p>grand celebration.</p>\n<p>“There are always flowers, of course,” said Bobbie, later, when</p>\n<p>a really earnest council was being held on the subject</p>\n<p>in the hay-loft where the broken chaff-cutting machine was, and</p>\n<p>the row of holes to drop hay through into the</p>",
        "<p>hay-racks over the mangers of the stables below.</p>\n<p>“He's got lots of flowers of his own,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“But it's always nice to have them given you,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie, “however many you've got of your own. We can</p>\n<p>use flowers for trimmings to the birthday. But there must</p>\n<p>be something to trim besides buns.”</p>\n<p>“Let's all be quiet and think,” said Phyllis; “no one's</p>",
        "<p>to speak until it's thought of something.”</p>\n<p>So they were all quiet and so very still that</p>\n<p>a brown rat thought that there was no one in</p>\n<p>the loft and came out very boldly. When Bobbie sneezed,</p>\n<p>the rat was quite shocked and hurried away, for he</p>\n<p>saw that a hay-loft where such things could happen was</p>\n<p>no place for a respectable middle-aged rat that liked a</p>",
        "<p>quiet life.</p>\n<p>“Hooray!” cried Peter, suddenly, “I've got it.” He jumped up</p>\n<p>and kicked at the loose hay.</p>\n<p>“What?” said the others, eagerly.</p>\n<p>“Why, Perks is so nice to everybody. There must be</p>\n<p>lots of people in the village who'd like to help</p>\n<p>to make him a birthday. Let's go round and ask</p>",
        "<p>everybody.”</p>\n<p>“Mother said we weren't to ask people for things,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“For ourselves, she meant, silly, not for other people. I'll</p>\n<p>ask the old gentleman too. You see if I don't,”</p>\n<p>said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Let's ask Mother first,” said Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, what's the use of bothering Mother about every little</p>\n<p>thing?” said Peter, “especially when she's busy. Come on. Let's</p>\n<p>go down to the village now and begin.”</p>\n<p>So they went. The old lady at the Post-office said</p>\n<p>she didn't see why Perks should have a birthday any</p>\n<p>more than anyone else.</p>\n<p>“No,” said Bobbie, “I should like everyone to have one.</p>",
        "<p>Only we know when his is.”</p>\n<p>“Mine's to-morrow,” said the old lady, “and much notice anyone</p>\n<p>will take of it. Go along with you.”</p>\n<p>So they went.</p>\n<p>And some people were kind, and some were crusty. And</p>\n<p>some would give and some would not. It is rather</p>\n<p>difficult work asking for things, even for other people, as</p>",
        "<p>you have no doubt found if you have ever tried</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>When the children got home and counted up what had</p>\n<p>been given and what had been promised, they felt that</p>\n<p>for the first day it was not so bad. Peter</p>\n<p>wrote down the lists of the things in the little</p>\n<p>pocket-book where he kept the numbers of his engines. These</p>",
        "<p>were the lists:--</p>\n<p>GIVEN. A tobacco pipe from the sweet shop. Half a</p>\n<p>pound of tea from the grocer's. A woollen scarf slightly</p>\n<p>faded from the draper's, which was the other side of</p>\n<p>the grocer's. A stuffed squirrel from the Doctor.</p>\n<p>PROMISED. A piece of meat from the butcher. Six fresh</p>\n<p>eggs from the woman who lived in the old turnpike</p>",
        "<p>cottage. A piece of honeycomb and six bootlaces from the</p>\n<p>cobbler, and an iron shovel from the blacksmith's.</p>\n<p>Very early next morning Bobbie got up and woke Phyllis.</p>\n<p>This had been agreed on between them. They had not</p>\n<p>told Peter because they thought he would think it silly.</p>\n<p>But they told him afterwards, when it had turned out</p>\n<p>all right.</p>",
        "<p>They cut a big bunch of roses, and put it</p>\n<p>in a basket with the needle-book that Phyllis had made</p>\n<p>for Bobbie on her birthday, and a very pretty blue</p>\n<p>necktie of Phyllis's. Then they wrote on a paper: 'For</p>\n<p>Mrs. Ransome, with our best love, because it is her</p>\n<p>birthday,' and they put the paper in the basket, and</p>\n<p>they took it to the Post-office, and went in and</p>",
        "<p>put it on the counter and ran away before the</p>\n<p>old woman at the Post-office had time to get into</p>\n<p>her shop.</p>\n<p>When they got home Peter had grown confidential over helping</p>\n<p>Mother to get the breakfast and had told her their</p>\n<p>plans.</p>\n<p>“There's no harm in it,” said Mother, “but it depends</p>",
        "<p>HOW you do it. I only hope he won't be</p>\n<p>offended and think it's CHARITY. Poor people are very proud,</p>\n<p>you know.”</p>\n<p>“It isn't because he's poor,” said Phyllis; “it's because we're</p>\n<p>fond of him.”</p>\n<p>“I'll find some things that Phyllis has outgrown,” said Mother,</p>\n<p>“if you're quite sure you can give them to him</p>",
        "<p>without his being offended. I should like to do some</p>\n<p>little thing for him because he's been so kind to</p>\n<p>you. I can't do much because we're poor ourselves. What</p>\n<p>are you writing, Bobbie?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing particular,” said Bobbie, who had suddenly begun to scribble.</p>\n<p>“I'm sure he'd like the things, Mother.”</p>\n<p>The morning of the fifteenth was spent very happily in</p>",
        "<p>getting the buns and watching Mother make A. P. on</p>\n<p>them with pink sugar. You know how it's done, of</p>\n<p>course? You beat up whites of eggs and mix powdered</p>\n<p>sugar with them, and put in a few drops of</p>\n<p>cochineal. And then you make a cone of clean, white</p>\n<p>paper with a little hole at the pointed end, and</p>\n<p>put the pink egg-sugar in at the big end. It</p>",
        "<p>runs slowly out at the pointed end, and you write</p>\n<p>the letters with it just as though it were a</p>\n<p>great fat pen full of pink sugar-ink.</p>\n<p>The buns looked beautiful with A. P. on every one,</p>\n<p>and, when they were put in a cool oven to</p>\n<p>set the sugar, the children went up to the village</p>\n<p>to collect the honey and the shovel and the other</p>",
        "<p>promised things.</p>\n<p>The old lady at the Post-office was standing on her</p>\n<p>doorstep. The children said “Good morning,” politely, as they passed.</p>\n<p>“Here, stop a bit,” she said.</p>\n<p>So they stopped.</p>\n<p>“Those roses,” said she.</p>\n<p>“Did you like them?” said Phyllis; “they were as fresh</p>",
        "<p>as fresh. _I_ made the needle-book, but it was Bobbie's</p>\n<p>present.” She skipped joyously as she spoke.</p>\n<p>“Here's your basket,” said the Post-office woman. She went in</p>\n<p>and brought out the basket. It was full of fat,</p>\n<p>red gooseberries.</p>\n<p>“I dare say Perks's children would like them,” said she.</p>\n<p>“You ARE an old dear,” said Phyllis, throwing her arms</p>",
        "<p>around the old lady's fat waist. “Perks WILL be pleased.”</p>\n<p>“He won't be half so pleased as I was with</p>\n<p>your needle-book and the tie and the pretty flowers and</p>\n<p>all,” said the old lady, patting Phyllis's shoulder. “You're good</p>\n<p>little souls, that you are. Look here. I've got a</p>\n<p>pram round the back in the wood-lodge. It was got</p>\n<p>for my Emmie's first, that didn't live but six months,</p>",
        "<p>and she never had but that one. I'd like Mrs.</p>\n<p>Perks to have it. It 'ud be a help to</p>\n<p>her with that great boy of hers. Will you take</p>\n<p>it along?”</p>\n<p>“OH!” said all the children together.</p>\n<p>When Mrs. Ransome had got out the perambulator and taken</p>\n<p>off the careful papers that covered it, and dusted it</p>",
        "<p>all over, she said:--</p>\n<p>“Well, there it is. I don't know but what I'd</p>\n<p>have given it to her before if I'd thought of</p>\n<p>it. Only I didn't quite know if she'd accept of</p>\n<p>it from me. You tell her it was my Emmie's</p>\n<p>little one's pram--”</p>\n<p>“Oh, ISN'T it nice to think there is going to</p>",
        "<p>be a real live baby in it again!”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Ransome, sighing, and then laughing; “here, I'll</p>\n<p>give you some peppermint cushions for the little ones, and</p>\n<p>then you run along before I give you the roof</p>\n<p>off my head and the clothes off my back.”</p>\n<p>All the things that had been collected for Perks were</p>\n<p>packed into the perambulator, and at half-past three Peter and</p>",
        "<p>Bobbie and Phyllis wheeled it down to the little yellow</p>\n<p>house where Perks lived.</p>\n<p>The house was very tidy. On the window ledge was</p>\n<p>a jug of wild-flowers, big daisies, and red sorrel, and</p>\n<p>feathery, flowery grasses.</p>\n<p>There was a sound of splashing from the wash-house, and</p>\n<p>a partly washed boy put his head round the door.</p>",
        "<p>“Mother's a-changing of herself,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Down in a minute,” a voice sounded down the narrow,</p>\n<p>freshly scrubbed stairs.</p>\n<p>The children waited. Next moment the stairs creaked and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Perks came down, buttoning her bodice. Her hair was brushed</p>\n<p>very smooth and tight, and her face shone with soap</p>\n<p>and water.</p>",
        "<p>“I'm a bit late changing, Miss,” she said to Bobbie,</p>\n<p>“owing to me having had a extry clean-up to-day, along</p>\n<p>o' Perks happening to name its being his birthday. I</p>\n<p>don't know what put it into his head to think</p>\n<p>of such a thing. We keeps the children's birthdays, of</p>\n<p>course; but him and me--we're too old for such like,</p>\n<p>as a general rule.”</p>",
        "<p>“We knew it was his birthday,” said Peter, “and we've</p>\n<p>got some presents for him outside in the perambulator.”</p>\n<p>As the presents were being unpacked, Mrs. Perks gasped. When</p>\n<p>they were all unpacked, she surprised and horrified the children</p>\n<p>by sitting suddenly down on a wooden chair and bursting</p>\n<p>into tears.</p>\n<p>“Oh, don't!” said everybody; “oh, please don't!” And Peter added,</p>",
        "<p>perhaps a little impatiently: “What on earth is the matter?</p>\n<p>You don't mean to say you don't like it?”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Perks only sobbed. The Perks children, now as shiny-faced</p>\n<p>as anyone could wish, stood at the wash-house door, and</p>\n<p>scowled at the intruders. There was a silence, an awkward</p>\n<p>silence.</p>\n<p>“DON'T you like it?” said Peter, again, while his sisters</p>",
        "<p>patted Mrs. Perks on the back.</p>\n<p>She stopped crying as suddenly as she had begun.</p>\n<p>“There, there, don't you mind me. I'M all right!” she</p>\n<p>said. “Like it? Why, it's a birthday such as Perks</p>\n<p>never 'ad, not even when 'e was a boy and</p>\n<p>stayed with his uncle, who was a corn chandler in</p>\n<p>his own account. He failed afterwards. Like it? Oh--” and</p>",
        "<p>then she went on and said all sorts of things</p>\n<p>that I won't write down, because I am sure that</p>\n<p>Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis would not like me to.</p>\n<p>Their ears got hotter and hotter, and their faces redder</p>\n<p>and redder, at the kind things Mrs. Perks said. They</p>\n<p>felt they had done nothing to deserve all this praise.</p>\n<p>At last Peter said: “Look here, we're glad you're pleased.</p>",
        "<p>But if you go on saying things like that, we</p>\n<p>must go home. And we did want to stay and</p>\n<p>see if Mr. Perks is pleased, too. But we can't</p>\n<p>stand this.”</p>\n<p>“I won't say another single word,” said Mrs. Perks, with</p>\n<p>a beaming face, “but that needn't stop me thinking, need</p>\n<p>it? For if ever--”</p>",
        "<p>“Can we have a plate for the buns?” Bobbie asked</p>\n<p>abruptly. And then Mrs. Perks hastily laid the table for</p>\n<p>tea, and the buns and the honey and the gooseberries</p>\n<p>were displayed on plates, and the roses were put in</p>\n<p>two glass jam jars, and the tea-table looked, as Mrs.</p>\n<p>Perks said, “fit for a Prince.”</p>\n<p>“To think!” she said, “me getting the place tidy early,</p>",
        "<p>and the little 'uns getting the wild-flowers and all--when never</p>\n<p>did I think there'd be anything more for him except</p>\n<p>the ounce of his pet particular that I got o'</p>\n<p>Saturday and been saving up for 'im ever since. Bless</p>\n<p>us! 'e IS early!”</p>\n<p>Perks had indeed unlatched the latch of the little front</p>\n<p>gate.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh,” whispered Bobbie, “let's hide in the back kitchen, and</p>\n<p>YOU tell him about it. But give him the tobacco</p>\n<p>first, because you got it for him. And when you've</p>\n<p>told him, we'll all come in and shout, 'Many happy</p>\n<p>returns!'”</p>\n<p>It was a very nice plan, but it did not</p>\n<p>quite come off. To begin with, there was only just</p>",
        "<p>time for Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis to rush into</p>\n<p>the wash-house, pushing the young and open-mouthed Perks children in</p>\n<p>front of them. There was not time to shut the</p>\n<p>door, so that, without at all meaning it, they had</p>\n<p>to listen to what went on in the kitchen. The</p>\n<p>wash-house was a tight fit for the Perks children and</p>\n<p>the Three Chimneys children, as well as all the wash-house's</p>",
        "<p>proper furniture, including the mangle and the copper.</p>\n<p>“Hullo, old woman!” they heard Mr. Perks's voice say; “here's</p>\n<p>a pretty set-out!”</p>\n<p>“It's your birthday tea, Bert,” said Mrs. Perks, “and here's</p>\n<p>a ounce of your extry particular. I got it o'</p>\n<p>Saturday along o' your happening to remember it was your</p>\n<p>birthday to-day.”</p>",
        "<p>“Good old girl!” said Mr. Perks, and there was a</p>\n<p>sound of a kiss.</p>\n<p>“But what's that pram doing here? And what's all these</p>\n<p>bundles? And where did you get the sweetstuff, and--”</p>\n<p>The children did not hear what Mrs. Perks replied, because</p>\n<p>just then Bobbie gave a start, put her hand in</p>\n<p>her pocket, and all her body grew stiff with horror.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh!” she whispered to the others, “whatever shall we do?</p>\n<p>I forgot to put the labels on any of the</p>\n<p>things! He won't know what's from who. He'll think it's</p>\n<p>all US, and that we're trying to be grand or</p>\n<p>charitable or something horrid.”</p>\n<p>“Hush!” said Peter.</p>\n<p>And then they heard the voice of Mr. Perks, loud</p>",
        "<p>and rather angry.</p>\n<p>“I don't care,” he said; “I won't stand it, and</p>\n<p>so I tell you straight.”</p>\n<p>“But,” said Mrs. Perks, “it's them children you make such</p>\n<p>a fuss about--the children from the Three Chimneys.”</p>\n<p>“I don't care,” said Perks, firmly, “not if it was</p>\n<p>a angel from Heaven. We've got on all right all</p>",
        "<p>these years and no favours asked. I'm not going to</p>\n<p>begin these sort of charity goings-on at my time of</p>\n<p>life, so don't you think it, Nell.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, hush!” said poor Mrs Perks; “Bert, shut your silly</p>\n<p>tongue, for goodness' sake. The all three of 'ems in</p>\n<p>the wash-house a-listening to every word you speaks.”</p>\n<p>“Then I'll give them something to listen to,” said the</p>",
        "<p>angry Perks; “I've spoke my mind to them afore now,</p>\n<p>and I'll do it again,” he added, and he took</p>\n<p>two strides to the wash-house door, and flung it wide</p>\n<p>open--as wide, that is, as it would go, with the</p>\n<p>tightly packed children behind it.</p>\n<p>“Come out,” said Perks, “come out and tell me what</p>\n<p>you mean by it. 'Ave I ever complained to you</p>",
        "<p>of being short, as you comes this charity lay over</p>\n<p>me?”</p>\n<p>“OH!” said Phyllis, “I thought you'd be so pleased; I'll</p>\n<p>never try to be kind to anyone else as long</p>\n<p>as I live. No, I won't, not never.”</p>\n<p>She burst into tears.</p>\n<p>“We didn't mean any harm,” said Peter.</p>",
        "<p>“It ain't what you means so much as what you</p>\n<p>does,” said Perks.</p>\n<p>“Oh, DON'T!” cried Bobbie, trying hard to be braver than</p>\n<p>Phyllis, and to find more words than Peter had done</p>\n<p>for explaining in. “We thought you'd love it. We always</p>\n<p>have things on our birthdays.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes,” said Perks, “your own relations; that's different.”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, no,” Bobbie answered. “NOT our own relations. All the</p>\n<p>servants always gave us things at home, and us to</p>\n<p>them when it was their birthdays. And when it was</p>\n<p>mine, and Mother gave me the brooch like a buttercup,</p>\n<p>Mrs. Viney gave me two lovely glass pots, and nobody</p>\n<p>thought she was coming the charity lay over us.”</p>\n<p>“If it had been glass pots here,” said Perks, “I</p>",
        "<p>wouldn't ha' said so much. It's there being all this</p>\n<p>heaps and heaps of things I can't stand. No--nor won't,</p>\n<p>neither.”</p>\n<p>“But they're not all from us--” said Peter, “only we</p>\n<p>forgot to put the labels on. They're from all sorts</p>\n<p>of people in the village.”</p>\n<p>“Who put 'em up to it, I'd like to know?”</p>",
        "<p>asked Perks.</p>\n<p>“Why, we did,” sniffed Phyllis.</p>\n<p>Perks sat down heavily in the elbow-chair and looked at</p>\n<p>them with what Bobbie afterwards described as withering glances of</p>\n<p>gloomy despair.</p>\n<p>“So you've been round telling the neighbours we can't make</p>\n<p>both ends meet? Well, now you've disgraced us as deep</p>",
        "<p>as you can in the neighbourhood, you can just take</p>\n<p>the whole bag of tricks back w'ere it come from.</p>\n<p>Very much obliged, I'm sure. I don't doubt but what</p>\n<p>you meant it kind, but I'd rather not be acquainted</p>\n<p>with you any longer if it's all the same to</p>\n<p>you.” He deliberately turned the chair round so that his</p>\n<p>back was turned to the children. The legs of the</p>",
        "<p>chair grated on the brick floor, and that was the</p>\n<p>only sound that broke the silence.</p>\n<p>Then suddenly Bobbie spoke.</p>\n<p>“Look here,” she said, “this is most awful.”</p>\n<p>“That's what I says,” said Perks, not turning round.</p>\n<p>“Look here,” said Bobbie, desperately, “we'll go if you like--and</p>\n<p>you needn't be friends with us any more if you</p>",
        "<p>don't want, but--”</p>\n<p>“WE shall always be friends with YOU, however nasty you</p>\n<p>are to us,” sniffed Phyllis, wildly.</p>\n<p>“Be quiet,” said Peter, in a fierce aside.</p>\n<p>“But before we go,” Bobbie went on desperately, “do let</p>\n<p>us show you the labels we wrote to put on</p>\n<p>the things.”</p>",
        "<p>“I don't want to see no labels,” said Perks, “except</p>\n<p>proper luggage ones in my own walk of life. Do</p>\n<p>you think I've kept respectable and outer debt on what</p>\n<p>I gets, and her having to take in washing, to</p>\n<p>be give away for a laughing-stock to all the neighbours?”</p>\n<p>“Laughing?” said Peter; “you don't know.”</p>\n<p>“You're a very hasty gentleman,” whined Phyllis; “you know you</p>",
        "<p>were wrong once before, about us not telling you the</p>\n<p>secret about the Russian. Do let Bobbie tell you about</p>\n<p>the labels!”</p>\n<p>“Well. Go ahead!” said Perks, grudgingly.</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” said Bobbie, fumbling miserably, yet not without hope,</p>\n<p>in her tightly stuffed pocket, “we wrote down all the</p>\n<p>things everybody said when they gave us the things, with</p>",
        "<p>the people's names, because Mother said we ought to be</p>\n<p>careful--because--but I wrote down what she said--and you'll see.”</p>\n<p>But Bobbie could not read the labels just at once.</p>\n<p>She had to swallow once or twice before she could</p>\n<p>begin.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Perks had been crying steadily ever since her husband</p>\n<p>had opened the wash-house door. Now she caught her breath,</p>",
        "<p>choked, and said:--</p>\n<p>“Don't you upset yourself, Missy. _I_ know you meant it</p>\n<p>kind if he doesn't.”</p>\n<p>“May I read the labels?” said Bobbie, crying on to</p>\n<p>the slips as she tried to sort them. “Mother's first.</p>\n<p>It says:--</p>\n<p>“'Little Clothes for Mrs. Perks's children.' Mother said, 'I'll find</p>",
        "<p>some of Phyllis's things that she's grown out of if</p>\n<p>you're quite sure Mr. Perks wouldn't be offended and think</p>\n<p>it's meant for charity. I'd like to do some little</p>\n<p>thing for him, because he's so kind to you. I</p>\n<p>can't do much because we're poor ourselves.'”</p>\n<p>Bobbie paused.</p>\n<p>“That's all right,” said Perks, “your Ma's a born lady.</p>",
        "<p>We'll keep the little frocks, and what not, Nell.”</p>\n<p>“Then there's the perambulator and the gooseberries, and the sweets,”</p>\n<p>said Bobbie, “they're from Mrs. Ransome. She said: 'I dare</p>\n<p>say Mr. Perks's children would like the sweets. And the</p>\n<p>perambulator was got for my Emmie's first--it didn't live but</p>\n<p>six months, and she's never had but that one. I'd</p>\n<p>like Mrs. Perks to have it. It would be a</p>",
        "<p>help with her fine boy. I'd have given it before</p>\n<p>if I'd been sure she'd accept of it from me.'</p>\n<p>She told me to tell you,” Bobbie added, “that it</p>\n<p>was her Emmie's little one's pram.”</p>\n<p>“I can't send that pram back, Bert,” said Mrs Perks,</p>\n<p>firmly, “and I won't. So don't you ask me--”</p>\n<p>“I'm not a-asking anything,” said Perks, gruffly.</p>",
        "<p>“Then the shovel,” said Bobbie. “Mr. James made it for</p>\n<p>you himself. And he said--where is it? Oh, yes, here!</p>\n<p>He said, 'You tell Mr. Perks it's a pleasure to</p>\n<p>make a little trifle for a man as is so</p>\n<p>much respected,' and then he said he wished he could</p>\n<p>shoe your children and his own children, like they do</p>\n<p>the horses, because, well, he knew what shoe leather was.”</p>",
        "<p>“James is a good enough chap,” said Perks.</p>\n<p>“Then the honey,” said Bobbie, in haste, “and the boot-laces.</p>\n<p>HE said he respected a man that paid his way--and</p>\n<p>the butcher said the same. And the old turnpike woman</p>\n<p>said many was the time you'd lent her a hand</p>\n<p>with her garden when you were a lad--and things like</p>\n<p>that came home to roost--I don't know what she meant.</p>",
        "<p>And everybody who gave anything said they liked you, and</p>\n<p>it was a very good idea of ours; and nobody</p>\n<p>said anything about charity or anything horrid like that. And</p>\n<p>the old gentleman gave Peter a gold pound for you,</p>\n<p>and said you were a man who knew your work.</p>\n<p>And I thought you'd LOVE to know how fond people</p>\n<p>are of you, and I never was so unhappy in</p>",
        "<p>my life. Good-bye. I hope you'll forgive us some day--”</p>\n<p>She could say no more, and she turned to go.</p>\n<p>“Stop,” said Perks, still with his back to them; “I</p>\n<p>take back every word I've said contrary to what you'd</p>\n<p>wish. Nell, set on the kettle.”</p>\n<p>“We'll take the things away if you're unhappy about them,”</p>\n<p>said Peter; “but I think everybody'll be most awfully disappointed,</p>",
        "<p>as well as us.”</p>\n<p>“I'm not unhappy about them,” said Perks; “I don't know,”</p>\n<p>he added, suddenly wheeling the chair round and showing a</p>\n<p>very odd-looking screwed-up face, “I don't know as ever I</p>\n<p>was better pleased. Not so much with the presents--though they're</p>\n<p>an A1 collection--but the kind respect of our neighbours. That's</p>\n<p>worth having, eh, Nell?”</p>",
        "<p>“I think it's all worth having,” said Mrs. Perks, “and</p>\n<p>you've made a most ridiculous fuss about nothing, Bert, if</p>\n<p>you ask me.”</p>\n<p>“No, I ain't,” said Perks, firmly; “if a man didn't</p>\n<p>respect hisself, no one wouldn't do it for him.”</p>\n<p>“But everyone respects you,” said Bobbie; “they all said so.”</p>\n<p>“I knew you'd like it when you really understood,” said</p>",
        "<p>Phyllis, brightly.</p>\n<p>“Humph! You'll stay to tea?” said Mr. Perks.</p>\n<p>Later on Peter proposed Mr. Perks's health. And Mr. Perks</p>\n<p>proposed a toast, also honoured in tea, and the toast</p>\n<p>was, “May the garland of friendship be ever green,” which</p>\n<p>was much more poetical than anyone had expected from him.</p>\n<p>* * * * * *</p>",
        "<p>“Jolly good little kids, those,” said Mr. Perks to his</p>\n<p>wife as they went to bed.</p>\n<p>“Oh, they're all right, bless their hearts,” said his wife;</p>\n<p>“it's you that's the aggravatingest old thing that ever was.</p>\n<p>I was ashamed of you--I tell you--”</p>\n<p>“You didn't need to be, old gal. I climbed down</p>\n<p>handsome soon as I understood it wasn't charity. But charity's</p>",
        "<p>what I never did abide, and won't neither.”</p>\n<p>* * * * * *</p>\n<p>All sorts of people were made happy by that birthday</p>\n<p>party. Mr. Perks and Mrs. Perks and the little Perkses</p>\n<p>by all the nice things and by the kind thoughts</p>\n<p>of their neighbours; the Three Chimneys children by the success,</p>\n<p>undoubted though unexpectedly delayed, of their plan; and Mrs. Ransome</p>",
        "<p>every time she saw the fat Perks baby in the</p>\n<p>perambulator. Mrs. Perks made quite a round of visits to</p>\n<p>thank people for their kind birthday presents, and after each</p>\n<p>visit felt that she had a better friend than she</p>\n<p>had thought.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Perks, reflectively, “it's not so much what you</p>\n<p>does as what you means; that's what I say. Now</p>",
        "<p>if it had been charity--”</p>\n<p>“Oh, drat charity,” said Mrs. Perks; “nobody won't offer you</p>\n<p>charity, Bert, however much you was to want it, I</p>\n<p>lay. That was just friendliness, that was.”</p>\n<p>When the clergyman called on Mrs. Perks, she told him</p>\n<p>all about it. “It WAS friendliness, wasn't it, Sir?” said</p>\n<p>she.</p>",
        "<p>“I think,” said the clergyman, “it was what is sometimes</p>\n<p>called loving-kindness.”</p>\n<p>So you see it was all right in the end.</p>\n<p>But if one does that sort of thing, one has</p>\n<p>to be careful to do it in the right way.</p>\n<p>For, as Mr. Perks said, when he had time to</p>\n<p>think it over, it's not so much what you do,</p>",
        "<p>as what you mean.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter X.</h3>\n<p>The terrible secret.</p>\n<p>When they first went to live at Three Chimneys, the</p>\n<p>children had talked a great deal about their Father, and</p>\n<p>had asked a great many questions about him, and what</p>\n<p>he was doing and where he was and when he</p>\n<p>would come home. Mother always answered their questions as well</p>\n<p>as she could. But as the time went on they</p>",
        "<p>grew to speak less of him. Bobbie had felt almost</p>\n<p>from the first that for some strange miserable reason these</p>\n<p>questions hurt Mother and made her sad. And little by</p>\n<p>little the others came to have this feeling, too, though</p>\n<p>they could not have put it into words.</p>\n<p>One day, when Mother was working so hard that she</p>\n<p>could not leave off even for ten minutes, Bobbie carried</p>",
        "<p>up her tea to the big bare room that they</p>\n<p>called Mother's workshop. It had hardly any furniture. Just a</p>\n<p>table and a chair and a rug. But always big</p>\n<p>pots of flowers on the window-sills and on the mantelpiece.</p>\n<p>The children saw to that. And from the three long</p>\n<p>uncurtained windows the beautiful stretch of meadow and moorland, the</p>\n<p>far violet of the hills, and the unchanging changefulness of</p>",
        "<p>cloud and sky.</p>\n<p>“Here's your tea, Mother-love,” said Bobbie; “do drink it while</p>\n<p>it's hot.”</p>\n<p>Mother laid down her pen among the pages that were</p>\n<p>scattered all over the table, pages covered with her writing,</p>\n<p>which was almost as plain as print, and much prettier.</p>\n<p>She ran her hands into her hair, as if she</p>",
        "<p>were going to pull it out by handfuls.</p>\n<p>“Poor dear head,” said Bobbie, “does it ache?”</p>\n<p>“No--yes--not much,” said Mother. “Bobbie, do you think Peter and</p>\n<p>Phil are FORGETTING Father?”</p>\n<p>“NO,” said Bobbie, indignantly. “Why?”</p>\n<p>“You none of you ever speak of him now.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie stood first on one leg and then on the</p>",
        "<p>other.</p>\n<p>“We often talk about him when we're by ourselves,” she</p>\n<p>said.</p>\n<p>“But not to me,” said Mother. “Why?”</p>\n<p>Bobbie did not find it easy to say why.</p>\n<p>“I--you--” she said and stopped. She went over to the</p>\n<p>window and looked out.</p>",
        "<p>“Bobbie, come here,” said her Mother, and Bobbie came.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Mother, putting her arm round Bobbie and laying</p>\n<p>her ruffled head against Bobbie's shoulder, “try to tell me,</p>\n<p>dear.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie fidgeted.</p>\n<p>“Tell Mother.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then,” said Bobbie, “I thought you were so unhappy</p>",
        "<p>about Daddy not being here, it made you worse when</p>\n<p>I talked about him. So I stopped doing it.”</p>\n<p>“And the others?”</p>\n<p>“I don't know about the others,” said Bobbie. “I never</p>\n<p>said anything about THAT to them. But I expect they</p>\n<p>felt the same about it as me.”</p>\n<p>“Bobbie dear,” said Mother, still leaning her head against her,</p>",
        "<p>“I'll tell you. Besides parting from Father, he and I</p>\n<p>have had a great sorrow--oh, terrible--worse than anything you can</p>\n<p>think of, and at first it did hurt to hear</p>\n<p>you all talking of him as if everything were just</p>\n<p>the same. But it would be much more terrible if</p>\n<p>you were to forget him. That would be worse than</p>\n<p>anything.”</p>",
        "<p>“The trouble,” said Bobbie, in a very little voice--“I promised</p>\n<p>I would never ask you any questions, and I never</p>\n<p>have, have I? But--the trouble--it won't last always?”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Mother, “the worst will be over when Father</p>\n<p>comes home to us.”</p>\n<p>“I wish I could comfort you,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Oh, my dear, do you suppose you don't? Do you</p>",
        "<p>think I haven't noticed how good you've all been, not</p>\n<p>quarrelling nearly as much as you used to--and all the</p>\n<p>little kind things you do for me--the flowers, and cleaning</p>\n<p>my shoes, and tearing up to make my bed before</p>\n<p>I get time to do it myself?”</p>\n<p>Bobbie HAD sometimes wondered whether Mother noticed these things.</p>\n<p>“That's nothing,” she said, “to what--”</p>",
        "<p>“I MUST get on with my work,” said Mother, giving</p>\n<p>Bobbie one last squeeze. “Don't say anything to the others.”</p>\n<p>That evening in the hour before bed-time instead of reading</p>\n<p>to the children Mother told them stories of the games</p>\n<p>she and Father used to have when they were children</p>\n<p>and lived near each other in the country--tales of the</p>\n<p>adventures of Father with Mother's brothers when they were all</p>",
        "<p>boys together. Very funny stories they were, and the children</p>\n<p>laughed as they listened.</p>\n<p>“Uncle Edward died before he was grown up, didn't he?”</p>\n<p>said Phyllis, as Mother lighted the bedroom candles.</p>\n<p>“Yes, dear,” said Mother, “you would have loved him. He</p>\n<p>was such a brave boy, and so adventurous. Always in</p>\n<p>mischief, and yet friends with everybody in spite of it.</p>",
        "<p>And your Uncle Reggie's in Ceylon--yes, and Father's away, too.</p>\n<p>But I think they'd all like to think we'd enjoyed</p>\n<p>talking about the things they used to do. Don't you</p>\n<p>think so?”</p>\n<p>“Not Uncle Edward,” said Phyllis, in a shocked tone; “he's</p>\n<p>in Heaven.”</p>\n<p>“You don't suppose he's forgotten us and all the old</p>",
        "<p>times, because God has taken him, any more than I</p>\n<p>forget him. Oh, no, he remembers. He's only away for</p>\n<p>a little time. We shall see him some day.”</p>\n<p>“And Uncle Reggie--and Father, too?” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mother. “Uncle Reggie and Father, too. Good night,</p>\n<p>my darlings.”</p>\n<p>“Good night,” said everyone. Bobbie hugged her mother more closely</p>",
        "<p>even than usual, and whispered in her ear, “Oh, I</p>\n<p>do love you so, Mummy--I do--I do--”</p>\n<p>When Bobbie came to think it all over, she tried</p>\n<p>not to wonder what the great trouble was. But she</p>\n<p>could not always help it. Father was not dead--like poor</p>\n<p>Uncle Edward--Mother had said so. And he was not ill,</p>\n<p>or Mother would have been with him. Being poor wasn't</p>",
        "<p>the trouble. Bobbie knew it was something nearer the heart</p>\n<p>than money could be.</p>\n<p>“I mustn't try to think what it is,” she told</p>\n<p>herself; “no, I mustn't. I AM glad Mother noticed about</p>\n<p>us not quarrelling so much. We'll keep that up.”</p>\n<p>And alas, that very afternoon she and Peter had what</p>\n<p>Peter called a first-class shindy.</p>",
        "<p>They had not been a week at Three Chimneys before</p>\n<p>they had asked Mother to let them have a piece</p>\n<p>of garden each for their very own, and she had</p>\n<p>agreed, and the south border under the peach trees had</p>\n<p>been divided into three pieces and they were allowed to</p>\n<p>plant whatever they liked there.</p>\n<p>Phyllis had planted mignonette and nasturtium and Virginia Stock in</p>",
        "<p>hers. The seeds came up, and though they looked just</p>\n<p>like weeds, Phyllis believed that they would bear flowers some</p>\n<p>day. The Virginia Stock justified her faith quite soon, and</p>\n<p>her garden was gay with a band of bright little</p>\n<p>flowers, pink and white and red and mauve.</p>\n<p>“I can't weed for fear I pull up the wrong</p>\n<p>things,” she used to say comfortably; “it saves such a</p>",
        "<p>lot of work.”</p>\n<p>Peter sowed vegetable seeds in his--carrots and onions and turnips.</p>\n<p>The seed was given to him by the farmer who</p>\n<p>lived in the nice black-and-white, wood-and-plaster house just beyond the</p>\n<p>bridge. He kept turkeys and guinea fowls, and was a</p>\n<p>most amiable man. But Peter's vegetables never had much of</p>\n<p>a chance, because he liked to use the earth of</p>",
        "<p>his garden for digging canals, and making forts and earthworks</p>\n<p>for his toy soldiers. And the seeds of vegetables rarely</p>\n<p>come to much in a soil that is constantly disturbed</p>\n<p>for the purposes of war and irrigation.</p>\n<p>Bobbie planted rose-bushes in her garden, but all the little</p>\n<p>new leaves of the rose-bushes shrivelled and withered, perhaps because</p>\n<p>she moved them from the other part of the garden</p>",
        "<p>in May, which is not at all the right time</p>\n<p>of year for moving roses. But she would not own</p>\n<p>that they were dead, and hoped on against hope, until</p>\n<p>the day when Perks came up to see the garden,</p>\n<p>and told her quite plainly that all her roses were</p>\n<p>as dead as doornails.</p>\n<p>“Only good for bonfires, Miss,” he said. “You just dig</p>",
        "<p>'em up and burn 'em, and I'll give you some</p>\n<p>nice fresh roots outer my garden; pansies, and stocks, and</p>\n<p>sweet willies, and forget-me-nots. I'll bring 'em along to-morrow if</p>\n<p>you get the ground ready.”</p>\n<p>So next day she set to work, and that happened</p>\n<p>to be the day when Mother had praised her and</p>\n<p>the others about not quarrelling. She moved the rose-bushes and</p>",
        "<p>carried them to the other end of the garden, where</p>\n<p>the rubbish heap was that they meant to make a</p>\n<p>bonfire of when Guy Fawkes' Day came.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Peter had decided to flatten out all his forts</p>\n<p>and earthworks, with a view to making a model of</p>\n<p>the railway-tunnel, cutting, embankment, canal, aqueduct, bridges, and all.</p>\n<p>So when Bobbie came back from her last thorny journey</p>",
        "<p>with the dead rose-bushes, he had got the rake and</p>\n<p>was using it busily.</p>\n<p>“_I_ was using the rake,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Well, I'm using it now,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“But I had it first,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Then it's my turn now,” said Peter. And that was</p>\n<p>how the quarrel began.</p>",
        "<p>“You're always being disagreeable about nothing,” said Peter, after some</p>\n<p>heated argument.</p>\n<p>“I had the rake first,” said Bobbie, flushed and defiant,</p>\n<p>holding on to its handle.</p>\n<p>“Don't--I tell you I said this morning I meant to</p>\n<p>have it. Didn't I, Phil?”</p>\n<p>Phyllis said she didn't want to be mixed up in</p>",
        "<p>their rows. And instantly, of course, she was.</p>\n<p>“If you remember, you ought to say.”</p>\n<p>“Of course she doesn't remember--but she might say so.”</p>\n<p>“I wish I'd had a brother instead of two whiny</p>\n<p>little kiddy sisters,” said Peter. This was always recognised as</p>\n<p>indicating the high-water mark of Peter's rage.</p>\n<p>Bobbie made the reply she always made to it.</p>",
        "<p>“I can't think why little boys were ever invented,” and</p>\n<p>just as she said it she looked up, and saw</p>\n<p>the three long windows of Mother's workshop flashing in the</p>\n<p>red rays of the sun. The sight brought back those</p>\n<p>words of praise:--</p>\n<p>“You don't quarrel like you used to do.”</p>\n<p>“OH!” cried Bobbie, just as if she had been hit,</p>",
        "<p>or had caught her finger in a door, or had</p>\n<p>felt the hideous sharp beginnings of toothache.</p>\n<p>“What's the matter?” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>Bobbie wanted to say: “Don't let's quarrel. Mother hates it</p>\n<p>so,” but though she tried hard, she couldn't. Peter was</p>\n<p>looking too disagreeable and insulting.</p>\n<p>“Take the horrid rake, then,” was the best she could</p>",
        "<p>manage. And she suddenly let go her hold on the</p>\n<p>handle. Peter had been holding on to it too firmly</p>\n<p>and pullingly, and now that the pull the other way</p>\n<p>was suddenly stopped, he staggered and fell over backward, the</p>\n<p>teeth of the rake between his feet.</p>\n<p>“Serve you right,” said Bobbie, before she could stop herself.</p>\n<p>Peter lay still for half a moment--long enough to frighten</p>",
        "<p>Bobbie a little. Then he frightened her a little more,</p>\n<p>for he sat up--screamed once--turned rather pale, and then lay</p>\n<p>back and began to shriek, faintly but steadily. It sounded</p>\n<p>exactly like a pig being killed a quarter of a</p>\n<p>mile off.</p>\n<p>Mother put her head out of the window, and it</p>\n<p>wasn't half a minute after that she was in the</p>",
        "<p>garden kneeling by the side of Peter, who never for</p>\n<p>an instant ceased to squeal.</p>\n<p>“What happened, Bobbie?” Mother asked.</p>\n<p>“It was the rake,” said Phyllis. “Peter was pulling at</p>\n<p>it, so was Bobbie, and she let go and he</p>\n<p>went over.”</p>\n<p>“Stop that noise, Peter,” said Mother. “Come. Stop at once.”</p>",
        "<p>Peter used up what breath he had left in a</p>\n<p>last squeal and stopped.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Mother, “are you hurt?”</p>\n<p>“If he was really hurt, he wouldn't make such a</p>\n<p>fuss,” said Bobbie, still trembling with fury; “he's not a</p>\n<p>coward!”</p>\n<p>“I think my foot's broken off, that's all,” said Peter,</p>",
        "<p>huffily, and sat up. Then he turned quite white. Mother</p>\n<p>put her arm round him.</p>\n<p>“He IS hurt,” she said; “he's fainted. Here, Bobbie, sit</p>\n<p>down and take his head on your lap.”</p>\n<p>Then Mother undid Peter's boots. As she took the right</p>\n<p>one off, something dripped from his foot on to the</p>\n<p>ground. It was red blood. And when the stocking came</p>",
        "<p>off there were three red wounds in Peter's foot and</p>\n<p>ankle, where the teeth of the rake had bitten him,</p>\n<p>and his foot was covered with red smears.</p>\n<p>“Run for water--a basinful,” said Mother, and Phyllis ran. She</p>\n<p>upset most of the water out of the basin in</p>\n<p>her haste, and had to fetch more in a jug.</p>\n<p>Peter did not open his eyes again till Mother had</p>",
        "<p>tied her handkerchief round his foot, and she and Bobbie</p>\n<p>had carried him in and laid him on the brown</p>\n<p>wooden settle in the dining-room. By this time Phyllis was</p>\n<p>halfway to the Doctor's.</p>\n<p>Mother sat by Peter and bathed his foot and talked</p>\n<p>to him, and Bobbie went out and got tea ready,</p>\n<p>and put on the kettle.</p>",
        "<p>“It's all I can do,” she told herself. “Oh, suppose</p>\n<p>Peter should die, or be a helpless cripple for life,</p>\n<p>or have to walk with crutches, or wear a boot</p>\n<p>with a sole like a log of wood!”</p>\n<p>She stood by the back door reflecting on these gloomy</p>\n<p>possibilities, her eyes fixed on the water-butt.</p>\n<p>“I wish I'd never been born,” she said, and she</p>",
        "<p>said it out loud.</p>\n<p>“Why, lawk a mercy, what's that for?” asked a voice,</p>\n<p>and Perks stood before her with a wooden trug basket</p>\n<p>full of green-leaved things and soft, loose earth.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it's you,” she said. “Peter's hurt his foot with</p>\n<p>a rake--three great gaping wounds, like soldiers get. And it</p>\n<p>was partly my fault.”</p>",
        "<p>“That it wasn't, I'll go bail,” said Perks. “Doctor seen</p>\n<p>him?”</p>\n<p>“Phyllis has gone for the Doctor.”</p>\n<p>“He'll be all right; you see if he isn't,” said</p>\n<p>Perks. “Why, my father's second cousin had a hay-fork run</p>\n<p>into him, right into his inside, and he was right</p>\n<p>as ever in a few weeks, all except his being</p>",
        "<p>a bit weak in the head afterwards, and they did</p>\n<p>say that it was along of his getting a touch</p>\n<p>of the sun in the hay-field, and not the fork</p>\n<p>at all. I remember him well. A kind-'earted chap, but</p>\n<p>soft, as you might say.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie tried to let herself be cheered by this heartening</p>\n<p>reminiscence.</p>",
        "<p>“Well,” said Perks, “you won't want to be bothered with</p>\n<p>gardening just this minute, I dare say. You show me</p>\n<p>where your garden is, and I'll pop the bits of</p>\n<p>stuff in for you. And I'll hang about, if I</p>\n<p>may make so free, to see the Doctor as he</p>\n<p>comes out and hear what he says. You cheer up,</p>\n<p>Missie. I lay a pound he ain't hurt, not to</p>",
        "<p>speak of.”</p>\n<p>But he was. The Doctor came and looked at the</p>\n<p>foot and bandaged it beautifully, and said that Peter must</p>\n<p>not put it to the ground for at least a</p>\n<p>week.</p>\n<p>“He won't be lame, or have to wear crutches or</p>\n<p>a lump on his foot, will he?” whispered Bobbie, breathlessly,</p>",
        "<p>at the door.</p>\n<p>“My aunt! No!” said Dr. Forrest; “he'll be as nimble</p>\n<p>as ever on his pins in a fortnight. Don't you</p>\n<p>worry, little Mother Goose.”</p>\n<p>It was when Mother had gone to the gate with</p>\n<p>the Doctor to take his last instructions and Phyllis was</p>\n<p>filling the kettle for tea, that Peter and Bobbie found</p>",
        "<p>themselves alone.</p>\n<p>“He says you won't be lame or anything,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Oh, course I shan't, silly,” said Peter, very much relieved</p>\n<p>all the same.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Peter, I AM so sorry,” said Bobbie, after a</p>\n<p>pause.</p>\n<p>“That's all right,” said Peter, gruffly.</p>",
        "<p>“It was ALL my fault,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Rot,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“If we hadn't quarrelled, it wouldn't have happened. I knew</p>\n<p>it was wrong to quarrel. I wanted to say so,</p>\n<p>but somehow I couldn't.”</p>\n<p>“Don't drivel,” said Peter. “I shouldn't have stopped if you</p>\n<p>HAD said it. Not likely. And besides, us rowing hadn't</p>",
        "<p>anything to do with it. I might have caught my</p>\n<p>foot in the hoe, or taken off my fingers in</p>\n<p>the chaff-cutting machine or blown my nose off with fireworks.</p>\n<p>It would have been hurt just the same whether we'd</p>\n<p>been rowing or not.”</p>\n<p>“But I knew it was wrong to quarrel,” said Bobbie,</p>\n<p>in tears, “and now you're hurt and--”</p>",
        "<p>“Now look here,” said Peter, firmly, “you just dry up.</p>\n<p>If you're not careful, you'll turn into a beastly little</p>\n<p>Sunday-school prig, so I tell you.”</p>\n<p>“I don't mean to be a prig. But it's so</p>\n<p>hard not to be when you're really trying to be</p>\n<p>good.”</p>\n<p>(The Gentle Reader may perhaps have suffered from this difficulty.)</p>",
        "<p>“Not it,” said Peter; “it's a jolly good thing it</p>\n<p>wasn't you was hurt. I'm glad it was ME. There!</p>\n<p>If it had been you, you'd have been lying on</p>\n<p>the sofa looking like a suffering angel and being the</p>\n<p>light of the anxious household and all that. And I</p>\n<p>couldn't have stood it.”</p>\n<p>“No, I shouldn't,” said Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, you would,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“I tell you I shouldn't.”</p>\n<p>“I tell you you would.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, children,” said Mother's voice at the door. “Quarrelling again?</p>\n<p>Already?”</p>\n<p>“We aren't quarrelling--not really,” said Peter. “I wish you wouldn't</p>\n<p>think it's rows every time we don't agree!” When Mother</p>",
        "<p>had gone out again, Bobbie broke out:--</p>\n<p>“Peter, I AM sorry you're hurt. But you ARE a</p>\n<p>beast to say I'm a prig.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” said Peter unexpectedly, “perhaps I am. You did say</p>\n<p>I wasn't a coward, even when you were in such</p>\n<p>a wax. The only thing is--don't you be a prig,</p>\n<p>that's all. You keep your eyes open and if you</p>",
        "<p>feel priggishness coming on just stop in time. See?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie, “I see.”</p>\n<p>“Then let's call it Pax,” said Peter, magnanimously: “bury the</p>\n<p>hatchet in the fathoms of the past. Shake hands on</p>\n<p>it. I say, Bobbie, old chap, I am tired.”</p>\n<p>He was tired for many days after that, and the</p>\n<p>settle seemed hard and uncomfortable in spite of all the</p>",
        "<p>pillows and bolsters and soft folded rugs. It was terrible</p>\n<p>not to be able to go out. They moved the</p>\n<p>settle to the window, and from there Peter could see</p>\n<p>the smoke of the trains winding along the valley. But</p>\n<p>he could not see the trains.</p>\n<p>At first Bobbie found it quite hard to be as</p>\n<p>nice to him as she wanted to be, for fear</p>",
        "<p>he should think her priggish. But that soon wore off,</p>\n<p>and both she and Phyllis were, as he observed, jolly</p>\n<p>good sorts. Mother sat with him when his sisters were</p>\n<p>out. And the words, “he's not a coward,” made Peter</p>\n<p>determined not to make any fuss about the pain in</p>\n<p>his foot, though it was rather bad, especially at night.</p>\n<p>Praise helps people very much, sometimes.</p>",
        "<p>There were visitors, too. Mrs. Perks came up to ask</p>\n<p>how he was, and so did the Station Master, and</p>\n<p>several of the village people. But the time went slowly,</p>\n<p>slowly.</p>\n<p>“I do wish there was something to read,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“I've read all our books fifty times over.”</p>\n<p>“I'll go to the Doctor's,” said Phyllis; “he's sure to</p>",
        "<p>have some.”</p>\n<p>“Only about how to be ill, and about people's nasty</p>\n<p>insides, I expect,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Perks has a whole heap of Magazines that came out</p>\n<p>of trains when people are tired of them,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“I'll run down and ask him.”</p>\n<p>So the girls went their two ways.</p>",
        "<p>Bobbie found Perks busy cleaning lamps.</p>\n<p>“And how's the young gent?” said he.</p>\n<p>“Better, thanks,” said Bobbie, “but he's most frightfully bored. I</p>\n<p>came to ask if you'd got any Magazines you could</p>\n<p>lend him.”</p>\n<p>“There, now,” said Perks, regretfully, rubbing his ear with a</p>\n<p>black and oily lump of cotton waste, “why didn't I</p>",
        "<p>think of that, now? I was trying to think of</p>\n<p>something as 'ud amuse him only this morning, and I</p>\n<p>couldn't think of anything better than a guinea-pig. And a</p>\n<p>young chap I know's going to fetch that over for</p>\n<p>him this tea-time.”</p>\n<p>“How lovely! A real live guinea! He will be pleased.</p>\n<p>But he'd like the Magazines as well.”</p>",
        "<p>“That's just it,” said Perks. “I've just sent the pick</p>\n<p>of 'em to Snigson's boy--him what's just getting over the</p>\n<p>pewmonia. But I've lots of illustrated papers left.”</p>\n<p>He turned to the pile of papers in the corner</p>\n<p>and took up a heap six inches thick.</p>\n<p>“There!” he said. “I'll just slip a bit of string</p>\n<p>and a bit of paper round 'em.”</p>",
        "<p>He pulled an old newspaper from the pile and spread</p>\n<p>it on the table, and made a neat parcel of</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>“There,” said he, “there's lots of pictures, and if he</p>\n<p>likes to mess 'em about with his paint-box, or coloured</p>\n<p>chalks or what not, why, let him. _I_ don't want</p>\n<p>'em.”</p>",
        "<p>“You're a dear,” said Bobbie, took the parcel, and started.</p>\n<p>The papers were heavy, and when she had to wait</p>\n<p>at the level-crossing while a train went by, she rested</p>\n<p>the parcel on the top of the gate. And idly</p>\n<p>she looked at the printing on the paper that the</p>\n<p>parcel was wrapped in.</p>\n<p>Suddenly she clutched the parcel tighter and bent her head</p>",
        "<p>over it. It seemed like some horrible dream. She read</p>\n<p>on--the bottom of the column was torn off--she could read</p>\n<p>no farther.</p>\n<p>She never remembered how she got home. But she went</p>\n<p>on tiptoe to her room and locked the door. Then</p>\n<p>she undid the parcel and read that printed column again,</p>\n<p>sitting on the edge of her bed, her hands and</p>",
        "<p>feet icy cold and her face burning. When she had</p>\n<p>read all there was, she drew a long, uneven breath.</p>\n<p>“So now I know,” she said.</p>\n<p>What she had read was headed, 'End of the Trial.</p>\n<p>Verdict. Sentence.'</p>\n<p>The name of the man who had been tried was</p>\n<p>the name of her Father. The verdict was 'Guilty.' And</p>",
        "<p>the sentence was 'Five years' Penal Servitude.'</p>\n<p>“Oh, Daddy,” she whispered, crushing the paper hard, “it's not</p>\n<p>true--I don't believe it. You never did it! Never, never,</p>\n<p>never!”</p>\n<p>There was a hammering on the door.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“It's me,” said the voice of Phyllis; “tea's ready, and</p>",
        "<p>a boy's brought Peter a guinea-pig. Come along down.”</p>\n<p>And Bobbie had to.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XI.</h3>\n<p>The hound in the red jersey.</p>\n<p>Bobbie knew the secret now. A sheet of old newspaper</p>\n<p>wrapped round a parcel--just a little chance like that--had given</p>\n<p>the secret to her. And she had to go down</p>\n<p>to tea and pretend that there was nothing the matter.</p>\n<p>The pretence was bravely made, but it wasn't very successful.</p>\n<p>For when she came in, everyone looked up from tea</p>",
        "<p>and saw her pink-lidded eyes and her pale face with</p>\n<p>red tear-blotches on it.</p>\n<p>“My darling,” cried Mother, jumping up from the tea-tray, “whatever</p>\n<p>IS the matter?”</p>\n<p>“My head aches, rather,” said Bobbie. And indeed it did.</p>\n<p>“Has anything gone wrong?” Mother asked.</p>\n<p>“I'm all right, really,” said Bobbie, and she telegraphed to</p>",
        "<p>her Mother from her swollen eyes this brief, imploring message--“NOT</p>\n<p>before the others!”</p>\n<p>Tea was not a cheerful meal. Peter was so distressed</p>\n<p>by the obvious fact that something horrid had happened to</p>\n<p>Bobbie that he limited his speech to repeating, “More bread</p>\n<p>and butter, please,” at startlingly short intervals. Phyllis stroked her</p>\n<p>sister's hand under the table to express sympathy, and knocked</p>",
        "<p>her cup over as she did it. Fetching a cloth</p>\n<p>and wiping up the spilt milk helped Bobbie a little.</p>\n<p>But she thought that tea would never end. Yet at</p>\n<p>last it did end, as all things do at last,</p>\n<p>and when Mother took out the tray, Bobbie followed her.</p>\n<p>“She's gone to own up,” said Phyllis to Peter; “I</p>\n<p>wonder what she's done.”</p>",
        "<p>“Broken something, I suppose,” said Peter, “but she needn't be</p>\n<p>so silly over it. Mother never rows for accidents. Listen!</p>\n<p>Yes, they're going upstairs. She's taking Mother up to show</p>\n<p>her--the water-jug with storks on it, I expect it is.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie, in the kitchen, had caught hold of Mother's hand</p>\n<p>as she set down the tea-things.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” Mother asked.</p>",
        "<p>But Bobbie only said, “Come upstairs, come up where nobody</p>\n<p>can hear us.”</p>\n<p>When she had got Mother alone in her room she</p>\n<p>locked the door and then stood quite still, and quite</p>\n<p>without words.</p>\n<p>All through tea she had been thinking of what to</p>\n<p>say; she had decided that “I know all,” or “All</p>",
        "<p>is known to me,” or “The terrible secret is a</p>\n<p>secret no longer,” would be the proper thing. But now</p>\n<p>that she and her Mother and that awful sheet of</p>\n<p>newspaper were alone in the room together, she found that</p>\n<p>she could say nothing.</p>\n<p>Suddenly she went to Mother and put her arms round</p>\n<p>her and began to cry again. And still she could</p>",
        "<p>find no words, only, “Oh, Mammy, oh, Mammy, oh, Mammy,”</p>\n<p>over and over again.</p>\n<p>Mother held her very close and waited.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Bobbie broke away from her and went to her</p>\n<p>bed. From under her mattress she pulled out the paper</p>\n<p>she had hidden there, and held it out, pointing to</p>\n<p>her Father's name with a finger that shook.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, Bobbie,” Mother cried, when one little quick look had</p>\n<p>shown her what it was, “you don't BELIEVE it? You</p>\n<p>don't believe Daddy did it?”</p>\n<p>“NO,” Bobbie almost shouted. She had stopped crying.</p>\n<p>“That's all right,” said Mother. “It's not true. And they've</p>\n<p>shut him up in prison, but he's done nothing wrong.</p>\n<p>He's good and noble and honourable, and he belongs to</p>",
        "<p>us. We have to think of that, and be proud</p>\n<p>of him, and wait.”</p>\n<p>Again Bobbie clung to her Mother, and again only one</p>\n<p>word came to her, but now that word was “Daddy,”</p>\n<p>and “Oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy!” again and again.</p>\n<p>“Why didn't you tell me, Mammy?” she asked presently.</p>\n<p>“Are you going to tell the others?” Mother asked.</p>",
        "<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“Because--”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” said Mother; “so you understand why I didn't tell</p>\n<p>you. We two must help each other to be brave.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie; “Mother, will it make you more unhappy</p>\n<p>if you tell me all about it? I want to</p>",
        "<p>understand.”</p>\n<p>So then, sitting cuddled up close to her Mother, Bobbie</p>\n<p>heard “all about it.” She heard how those men, who</p>\n<p>had asked to see Father on that remembered last night</p>\n<p>when the Engine was being mended, had come to arrest</p>\n<p>him, charging him with selling State secrets to the Russians--with</p>\n<p>being, in fact, a spy and a traitor. She heard</p>",
        "<p>about the trial, and about the evidence--letters, found in Father's</p>\n<p>desk at the office, letters that convinced the jury that</p>\n<p>Father was guilty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, how could they look at him and believe it!”</p>\n<p>cried Bobbie; “and how could ANY one do such a</p>\n<p>thing!”</p>\n<p>“SOMEONE did it,” said Mother, “and all the evidence was</p>",
        "<p>against Father. Those letters--”</p>\n<p>“Yes. How did the letters get into his desk?”</p>\n<p>“Someone put them there. And the person who put them</p>\n<p>there was the person who was really guilty.”</p>\n<p>“HE must be feeling pretty awful all this time,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie, thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>“I don't believe he had any feelings,” Mother said hotly;</p>",
        "<p>“he couldn't have done a thing like that if he</p>\n<p>had.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps he just shoved the letters into the desk to</p>\n<p>hide them when he thought he was going to be</p>\n<p>found out. Why don't you tell the lawyers, or someone,</p>\n<p>that it must have been that person? There wasn't anyone</p>\n<p>that would have hurt Father on purpose, was there?”</p>",
        "<p>“I don't know--I don't know. The man under him who</p>\n<p>got Daddy's place when he--when the awful thing happened--he was</p>\n<p>always jealous of your Father because Daddy was so clever</p>\n<p>and everyone thought such a lot of him. And Daddy</p>\n<p>never quite trusted that man.”</p>\n<p>“Couldn't we explain all that to someone?”</p>\n<p>“Nobody will listen,” said Mother, very bitterly, “nobody at all.</p>",
        "<p>Do you suppose I've not tried everything? No, my dearest,</p>\n<p>there's nothing to be done. All we can do, you</p>\n<p>and I and Daddy, is to be brave, and patient,</p>\n<p>and--” she spoke very softly--“to pray, Bobbie, dear.”</p>\n<p>“Mother, you've got very thin,” said Bobbie, abruptly.</p>\n<p>“A little, perhaps.”</p>\n<p>“And oh,” said Bobbie, “I do think you're the bravest</p>",
        "<p>person in the world as well as the nicest!”</p>\n<p>“We won't talk of all this any more, will we,</p>\n<p>dear?” said Mother; “we must bear it and be brave.</p>\n<p>And, darling, try not to think of it. Try to</p>\n<p>be cheerful, and to amuse yourself and the others. It's</p>\n<p>much easier for me if you can be a little</p>\n<p>bit happy and enjoy things. Wash your poor little round</p>",
        "<p>face, and let's go out into the garden for a</p>\n<p>bit.”</p>\n<p>The other two were very gentle and kind to Bobbie.</p>\n<p>And they did not ask her what was the matter.</p>\n<p>This was Peter's idea, and he had drilled Phyllis, who</p>\n<p>would have asked a hundred questions if she had been</p>\n<p>left to herself.</p>",
        "<p>A week later Bobbie managed to get away alone. And</p>\n<p>once more she wrote a letter. And once more it</p>\n<p>was to the old gentleman.</p>\n<p>“My dear Friend,” she said, “you see what is in</p>\n<p>this paper. It is not true. Father never did it.</p>\n<p>Mother says someone put the papers in Father's desk, and</p>\n<p>she says the man under him that got Father's place</p>",
        "<p>afterwards was jealous of Father, and Father suspected him a</p>\n<p>long time. But nobody listens to a word she says,</p>\n<p>but you are so good and clever, and you found</p>\n<p>out about the Russian gentleman's wife directly. Can't you find</p>\n<p>out who did the treason because he wasn't Father upon</p>\n<p>my honour; he is an Englishman and uncapable to do</p>\n<p>such things, and then they would let Father out of</p>",
        "<p>prison. It is dreadful, and Mother is getting so thin.</p>\n<p>She told us once to pray for all prisoners and</p>\n<p>captives. I see now. Oh, do help me--there is only</p>\n<p>just Mother and me know, and we can't do anything.</p>\n<p>Peter and Phil don't know. I'll pray for you twice</p>\n<p>every day as long as I live if you'll only</p>\n<p>try--just try to find out. Think if it was YOUR</p>",
        "<p>Daddy, what you would feel. Oh, do, do, DO help</p>\n<p>me. With love</p>\n<p>“I remain Your affectionately little friend</p>\n<p>“Roberta.</p>\n<p>P.S. Mother would send her kind regards if she knew</p>\n<p>I am writing--but it is no use telling her I</p>\n<p>am, in case you can't do anything. But I know</p>",
        "<p>you will. Bobbie with best love.”</p>\n<p>She cut the account of her Father's trial out of</p>\n<p>the newspaper with Mother's big cutting-out scissors, and put it</p>\n<p>in the envelope with her letter.</p>\n<p>Then she took it down to the station, going out</p>\n<p>the back way and round by the road, so that</p>\n<p>the others should not see her and offer to come</p>",
        "<p>with her, and she gave the letter to the Station</p>\n<p>Master to give to the old gentleman next morning.</p>\n<p>“Where HAVE you been?” shouted Peter, from the top of</p>\n<p>the yard wall where he and Phyllis were.</p>\n<p>“To the station, of course,” said Bobbie; “give us a</p>\n<p>hand, Pete.”</p>\n<p>She set her foot on the lock of the yard</p>",
        "<p>door. Peter reached down a hand.</p>\n<p>“What on earth?” she asked as she reached the wall-top--for</p>\n<p>Phyllis and Peter were very muddy. A lump of wet</p>\n<p>clay lay between them on the wall, they had each</p>\n<p>a slip of slate in a very dirty hand, and</p>\n<p>behind Peter, out of the reach of accidents, were several</p>\n<p>strange rounded objects rather like very fat sausages, hollow, but</p>",
        "<p>closed up at one end.</p>\n<p>“It's nests,” said Peter, “swallows' nests. We're going to dry</p>\n<p>them in the oven and hang them up with string</p>\n<p>under the eaves of the coach-house.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Phyllis; “and then we're going to save up</p>\n<p>all the wool and hair we can get, and in</p>\n<p>the spring we'll line them, and then how pleased the</p>",
        "<p>swallows will be!”</p>\n<p>“I've often thought people don't do nearly enough for dumb</p>\n<p>animals,” said Peter with an air of virtue. “I do</p>\n<p>think people might have thought of making nests for poor</p>\n<p>little swallows before this.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Bobbie, vaguely, “if everybody thought of everything, there'd</p>\n<p>be nothing left for anybody else to think about.”</p>",
        "<p>“Look at the nests--aren't they pretty?” said Phyllis, reaching across</p>\n<p>Peter to grasp a nest.</p>\n<p>“Look out, Phil, you goat,” said her brother. But it</p>\n<p>was too late; her strong little fingers had crushed the</p>\n<p>nest.</p>\n<p>“There now,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Never mind,” said Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>“It IS one of my own,” said Phyllis, “so you</p>\n<p>needn't jaw, Peter. Yes, we've put our initial names on</p>\n<p>the ones we've done, so that the swallows will know</p>\n<p>who they've got to be so grateful to and fond</p>\n<p>of.”</p>\n<p>“Swallows can't read, silly,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Silly yourself,” retorted Phyllis; “how do you know?”</p>",
        "<p>“Who thought of making the nests, anyhow?” shouted Peter.</p>\n<p>“I did,” screamed Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Nya,” rejoined Peter, “you only thought of making hay ones</p>\n<p>and sticking them in the ivy for the sparrows, and</p>\n<p>they'd have been sopping LONG before egg-laying time. It was</p>\n<p>me said clay and swallows.”</p>\n<p>“I don't care what you said.”</p>",
        "<p>“Look,” said Bobbie, “I've made the nest all right again.</p>\n<p>Give me the bit of stick to mark your initial</p>\n<p>name on it. But how can you? Your letter and</p>\n<p>Peter's are the same. P. for Peter, P. for Phyllis.”</p>\n<p>“I put F. for Phyllis,” said the child of that</p>\n<p>name. “That's how it sounds. The swallows wouldn't spell Phyllis</p>\n<p>with a P., I'm certain-sure.”</p>",
        "<p>“They can't spell at all,” Peter was still insisting.</p>\n<p>“Then why do you see them always on Christmas cards</p>\n<p>and valentines with letters round their necks? How would they</p>\n<p>know where to go if they couldn't read?”</p>\n<p>“That's only in pictures. You never saw one really with</p>\n<p>letters round its neck.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I have a pigeon, then; at least Daddy told</p>",
        "<p>me they did. Only it was under their wings and</p>\n<p>not round their necks, but it comes to the same</p>\n<p>thing, and--”</p>\n<p>“I say,” interrupted Bobbie, “there's to be a paperchase to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>“Who?” Peter asked.</p>\n<p>“Grammar School. Perks thinks the hare will go along by</p>\n<p>the line at first. We might go along the cutting.</p>",
        "<p>You can see a long way from there.”</p>\n<p>The paperchase was found to be a more amusing subject</p>\n<p>of conversation than the reading powers of swallows. Bobbie had</p>\n<p>hoped it might be. And next morning Mother let them</p>\n<p>take their lunch and go out for the day to</p>\n<p>see the paperchase.</p>\n<p>“If we go to the cutting,” said Peter, “we shall</p>",
        "<p>see the workmen, even if we miss the paperchase.”</p>\n<p>Of course it had taken some time to get the</p>\n<p>line clear from the rocks and earth and trees that</p>\n<p>had fallen on it when the great landslip happened. That</p>\n<p>was the occasion, you will remember, when the three children</p>\n<p>saved the train from being wrecked by waving six little</p>\n<p>red-flannel-petticoat flags. It is always interesting to watch people working,</p>",
        "<p>especially when they work with such interesting things as spades</p>\n<p>and picks and shovels and planks and barrows, when they</p>\n<p>have cindery red fires in iron pots with round holes</p>\n<p>in them, and red lamps hanging near the works at</p>\n<p>night. Of course the children were never out at night;</p>\n<p>but once, at dusk, when Peter had got out of</p>\n<p>his bedroom skylight on to the roof, he had seen</p>",
        "<p>the red lamp shining far away at the edge of</p>\n<p>the cutting. The children had often been down to watch</p>\n<p>the work, and this day the interest of picks and</p>\n<p>spades, and barrows being wheeled along planks, completely put the</p>\n<p>paperchase out of their heads, so that they quite jumped</p>\n<p>when a voice just behind them panted, “Let me pass,</p>\n<p>please.” It was the hare--a big-boned, loose-limbed boy, with dark</p>",
        "<p>hair lying flat on a very damp forehead. The bag</p>\n<p>of torn paper under his arm was fastened across one</p>\n<p>shoulder by a strap. The children stood back. The hare</p>\n<p>ran along the line, and the workmen leaned on their</p>\n<p>picks to watch him. He ran on steadily and disappeared</p>\n<p>into the mouth of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>“That's against the by-laws,” said the foreman.</p>",
        "<p>“Why worry?” said the oldest workman; “live and let live's</p>\n<p>what I always say. Ain't you never been young yourself,</p>\n<p>Mr. Bates?”</p>\n<p>“I ought to report him,” said the foreman.</p>\n<p>“Why spoil sport's what I always say.”</p>\n<p>“Passengers are forbidden to cross the line on any pretence,”</p>\n<p>murmured the foreman, doubtfully.</p>",
        "<p>“He ain't no passenger,” said one of the workmen.</p>\n<p>“Nor 'e ain't crossed the line, not where we could</p>\n<p>see 'im do it,” said another.</p>\n<p>“Nor yet 'e ain't made no pretences,” said a third.</p>\n<p>“And,” said the oldest workman, “'e's outer sight now. What</p>\n<p>the eye don't see the 'art needn't take no notice</p>\n<p>of's what I always say.”</p>",
        "<p>And now, following the track of the hare by the</p>\n<p>little white blots of scattered paper, came the hounds. There</p>\n<p>were thirty of them, and they all came down the</p>\n<p>steep, ladder-like steps by ones and twos and threes and</p>\n<p>sixes and sevens. Bobbie and Phyllis and Peter counted them</p>\n<p>as they passed. The foremost ones hesitated a moment at</p>\n<p>the foot of the ladder, then their eyes caught the</p>",
        "<p>gleam of scattered whiteness along the line and they turned</p>\n<p>towards the tunnel, and, by ones and twos and threes</p>\n<p>and sixes and sevens, disappeared in the dark mouth of</p>\n<p>it. The last one, in a red jersey, seemed to</p>\n<p>be extinguished by the darkness like a candle that is</p>\n<p>blown out.</p>\n<p>“They don't know what they're in for,” said the foreman;</p>",
        "<p>“it isn't so easy running in the dark. The tunnel</p>\n<p>takes two or three turns.”</p>\n<p>“They'll take a long time to get through, you think?”</p>\n<p>Peter asked.</p>\n<p>“An hour or more, I shouldn't wonder.”</p>\n<p>“Then let's cut across the top and see them come</p>\n<p>out at the other end,” said Peter; “we shall get</p>",
        "<p>there long before they do.”</p>\n<p>The counsel seemed good, and they went.</p>\n<p>They climbed the steep steps from which they had picked</p>\n<p>the wild cherry blossom for the grave of the little</p>\n<p>wild rabbit, and reaching the top of the cutting, set</p>\n<p>their faces towards the hill through which the tunnel was</p>\n<p>cut. It was stiff work.</p>",
        "<p>“It's like Alps,” said Bobbie, breathlessly.</p>\n<p>“Or Andes,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“It's like Himmy what's its names?” gasped Phyllis. “Mount Everlasting.</p>\n<p>Do let's stop.”</p>\n<p>“Stick to it,” panted Peter; “you'll get your second wind</p>\n<p>in a minute.”</p>\n<p>Phyllis consented to stick to it--and on they went, running</p>",
        "<p>when the turf was smooth and the slope easy, climbing</p>\n<p>over stones, helping themselves up rocks by the branches of</p>\n<p>trees, creeping through narrow openings between tree trunks and rocks,</p>\n<p>and so on and on, up and up, till at</p>\n<p>last they stood on the very top of the hill</p>\n<p>where they had so often wished to be.</p>\n<p>“Halt!” cried Peter, and threw himself flat on the grass.</p>",
        "<p>For the very top of the hill was a smooth,</p>\n<p>turfed table-land, dotted with mossy rocks and little mountain-ash trees.</p>\n<p>The girls also threw themselves down flat.</p>\n<p>“Plenty of time,” Peter panted; “the rest's all down hill.”</p>\n<p>When they were rested enough to sit up and look</p>\n<p>round them, Bobbie cried:--</p>\n<p>“Oh, look!”</p>",
        "<p>“What at?” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“The view,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“I hate views,” said Phyllis, “don't you, Peter?”</p>\n<p>“Let's get on,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“But this isn't like a view they take you to</p>\n<p>in carriages when you're at the seaside, all sea and</p>\n<p>sand and bare hills. It's like the 'coloured counties' in</p>",
        "<p>one of Mother's poetry books.”</p>\n<p>“It's not so dusty,” said Peter; “look at the Aqueduct</p>\n<p>straddling slap across the valley like a giant centipede, and</p>\n<p>then the towns sticking their church spires up out of</p>\n<p>the trees like pens out of an inkstand. _I_ think</p>\n<p>it's more like</p>\n<p>“There could he see the banners Of twelve fair cities</p>",
        "<p>shine.”</p>\n<p>“I love it,” said Bobbie; “it's worth the climb.”</p>\n<p>“The paperchase is worth the climb,” said Phyllis, “if we</p>\n<p>don't lose it. Let's get on. It's all down hill</p>\n<p>now.”</p>\n<p>“_I_ said that ten minutes ago,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Well, I'VE said it now,” said Phyllis; “come on.”</p>",
        "<p>“Loads of time,” said Peter. And there was. For when</p>\n<p>they had got down to a level with the top</p>\n<p>of the tunnel's mouth--they were a couple of hundred yards</p>\n<p>out of their reckoning and had to creep along the</p>\n<p>face of the hill--there was no sign of the hare</p>\n<p>or the hounds.</p>\n<p>“They've gone long ago, of course,” said Phyllis, as they</p>",
        "<p>leaned on the brick parapet above the tunnel.</p>\n<p>“I don't think so,” said Bobbie, “but even if they</p>\n<p>had, it's ripping here, and we shall see the trains</p>\n<p>come out of the tunnel like dragons out of lairs.</p>\n<p>We've never seen that from the top side before.”</p>\n<p>“No more we have,” said Phyllis, partially appeased.</p>\n<p>It was really a most exciting place to be in.</p>",
        "<p>The top of the tunnel seemed ever so much farther</p>\n<p>from the line than they had expected, and it was</p>\n<p>like being on a bridge, but a bridge overgrown with</p>\n<p>bushes and creepers and grass and wild-flowers.</p>\n<p>“I KNOW the paperchase has gone long ago,” said Phyllis</p>\n<p>every two minutes, and she hardly knew whether she was</p>\n<p>pleased or disappointed when Peter, leaning over the parapet, suddenly</p>",
        "<p>cried:--</p>\n<p>“Look out. Here he comes!”</p>\n<p>They all leaned over the sun-warmed brick wall in time</p>\n<p>to see the hare, going very slowly, come out from</p>\n<p>the shadow of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>“There, now,” said Peter, “what did I tell you? Now</p>\n<p>for the hounds!”</p>",
        "<p>Very soon came the hounds--by ones and twos and threes</p>\n<p>and sixes and sevens--and they also were going slowly and</p>\n<p>seemed very tired. Two or three who lagged far behind</p>\n<p>came out long after the others.</p>\n<p>“There,” said Bobbie, “that's all--now what shall we do?”</p>\n<p>“Go along into the tulgy wood over there and have</p>\n<p>lunch,” said Phyllis; “we can see them for miles from</p>",
        "<p>up here.”</p>\n<p>“Not yet,” said Peter. “That's not the last. There's the</p>\n<p>one in the red jersey to come yet. Let's see</p>\n<p>the last of them come out.”</p>\n<p>But though they waited and waited and waited, the boy</p>\n<p>in the red jersey did not appear.</p>\n<p>“Oh, let's have lunch,” said Phyllis; “I've got a pain</p>",
        "<p>in my front with being so hungry. You must have</p>\n<p>missed seeing the red-jerseyed one when he came out with</p>\n<p>the others--”</p>\n<p>But Bobbie and Peter agreed that he had not come</p>\n<p>out with the others.</p>\n<p>“Let's get down to the tunnel mouth,” said Peter; “then</p>\n<p>perhaps we shall see him coming along from the inside.</p>",
        "<p>I expect he felt spun-chuck, and rested in one of</p>\n<p>the manholes. You stay up here and watch, Bob, and</p>\n<p>when I signal from below, you come down. We might</p>\n<p>miss seeing him on the way down, with all these</p>\n<p>trees.”</p>\n<p>So the others climbed down and Bobbie waited till they</p>\n<p>signalled to her from the line below. And then she,</p>",
        "<p>too, scrambled down the roundabout slippery path among roots and</p>\n<p>moss till she stepped out between two dogwood trees and</p>\n<p>joined the others on the line. And still there was</p>\n<p>no sign of the hound with the red jersey.</p>\n<p>“Oh, do, DO let's have something to eat,” wailed Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“I shall die if you don't, and then you'll be</p>\n<p>sorry.”</p>",
        "<p>“Give her the sandwiches, for goodness' sake, and stop her</p>\n<p>silly mouth,” said Peter, not quite unkindly. “Look here,” he</p>\n<p>added, turning to Bobbie, “perhaps we'd better have one each,</p>\n<p>too. We may need all our strength. Not more than</p>\n<p>one, though. There's no time.”</p>\n<p>“What?” asked Bobbie, her mouth already full, for she was</p>\n<p>just as hungry as Phyllis.</p>",
        "<p>“Don't you see,” replied Peter, impressively, “that red-jerseyed hound has</p>\n<p>had an accident--that's what it is. Perhaps even as we</p>\n<p>speak he's lying with his head on the metals, an</p>\n<p>unresisting prey to any passing express--”</p>\n<p>“Oh, don't try to talk like a book,” cried Bobbie,</p>\n<p>bolting what was left of her sandwich; “come on. Phil,</p>\n<p>keep close behind me, and if a train comes, stand</p>",
        "<p>flat against the tunnel wall and hold your petticoats close</p>\n<p>to you.”</p>\n<p>“Give me one more sandwich,” pleaded Phyllis, “and I will.”</p>\n<p>“I'm going first,” said Peter; “it was my idea,” and</p>\n<p>he went.</p>\n<p>Of course you know what going into a tunnel is</p>\n<p>like? The engine gives a scream and then suddenly the</p>",
        "<p>noise of the running, rattling train changes and grows different</p>\n<p>and much louder. Grown-up people pull up the windows and</p>\n<p>hold them by the strap. The railway carriage suddenly grows</p>\n<p>like night--with lamps, of course, unless you are in a</p>\n<p>slow local train, in which case lamps are not always</p>\n<p>provided. Then by and by the darkness outside the carriage</p>\n<p>window is touched by puffs of cloudy whiteness, then you</p>",
        "<p>see a blue light on the walls of the tunnel,</p>\n<p>then the sound of the moving train changes once more,</p>\n<p>and you are out in the good open air again,</p>\n<p>and grown-ups let the straps go. The windows, all dim</p>\n<p>with the yellow breath of the tunnel, rattle down into</p>\n<p>their places, and you see once more the dip and</p>\n<p>catch of the telegraph wires beside the line, and the</p>",
        "<p>straight-cut hawthorn hedges with the tiny baby trees growing up</p>\n<p>out of them every thirty yards.</p>\n<p>All this, of course, is what a tunnel means when</p>\n<p>you are in a train. But everything is quite different</p>\n<p>when you walk into a tunnel on your own feet,</p>\n<p>and tread on shifting, sliding stones and gravel on a</p>\n<p>path that curves downwards from the shining metals to the</p>",
        "<p>wall. Then you see slimy, oozy trickles of water running</p>\n<p>down the inside of the tunnel, and you notice that</p>\n<p>the bricks are not red or brown, as they are</p>\n<p>at the tunnel's mouth, but dull, sticky, sickly green. Your</p>\n<p>voice, when you speak, is quite changed from what it</p>\n<p>was out in the sunshine, and it is a long</p>\n<p>time before the tunnel is quite dark.</p>",
        "<p>It was not yet quite dark in the tunnel when</p>\n<p>Phyllis caught at Bobbie's skirt, ripping out half a yard</p>\n<p>of gathers, but no one noticed this at the time.</p>\n<p>“I want to go back,” she said, “I don't like</p>\n<p>it. It'll be pitch dark in a minute. I WON'T</p>\n<p>go on in the dark. I don't care what you</p>\n<p>say, I WON'T.”</p>",
        "<p>“Don't be a silly cuckoo,” said Peter; “I've got a</p>\n<p>candle end and matches, and--what's that?”</p>\n<p>“That” was a low, humming sound on the railway line,</p>\n<p>a trembling of the wires beside it, a buzzing, humming</p>\n<p>sound that grew louder and louder as they listened.</p>\n<p>“It's a train,” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Which line?”</p>",
        "<p>“Let me go back,” cried Phyllis, struggling to get away</p>\n<p>from the hand by which Bobbie held her.</p>\n<p>“Don't be a coward,” said Bobbie; “it's quite safe. Stand</p>\n<p>back.”</p>\n<p>“Come on,” shouted Peter, who was a few yards ahead.</p>\n<p>“Quick! Manhole!”</p>\n<p>The roar of the advancing train was now louder than</p>",
        "<p>the noise you hear when your head is under water</p>\n<p>in the bath and both taps are running, and you</p>\n<p>are kicking with your heels against the bath's tin sides.</p>\n<p>But Peter had shouted for all he was worth, and</p>\n<p>Bobbie heard him. She dragged Phyllis along to the manhole.</p>\n<p>Phyllis, of course, stumbled over the wires and grazed both</p>\n<p>her legs. But they dragged her in, and all three</p>",
        "<p>stood in the dark, damp, arched recess while the train</p>\n<p>roared louder and louder. It seemed as if it would</p>\n<p>deafen them. And, in the distance, they could see its</p>\n<p>eyes of fire growing bigger and brighter every instant.</p>\n<p>“It IS a dragon--I always knew it was--it takes its</p>\n<p>own shape in here, in the dark,” shouted Phyllis. But</p>\n<p>nobody heard her. You see the train was shouting, too,</p>",
        "<p>and its voice was bigger than hers.</p>\n<p>And now, with a rush and a roar and a</p>\n<p>rattle and a long dazzling flash of lighted carriage windows,</p>\n<p>a smell of smoke, and blast of hot air, the</p>\n<p>train hurtled by, clanging and jangling and echoing in the</p>\n<p>vaulted roof of the tunnel. Phyllis and Bobbie clung to</p>\n<p>each other. Even Peter caught hold of Bobbie's arm, “in</p>",
        "<p>case she should be frightened,” as he explained afterwards.</p>\n<p>And now, slowly and gradually, the tail-lights grew smaller and</p>\n<p>smaller, and so did the noise, till with one last</p>\n<p>WHIZ the train got itself out of the tunnel, and</p>\n<p>silence settled again on its damp walls and dripping roof.</p>\n<p>“OH!” said the children, all together in a whisper.</p>\n<p>Peter was lighting the candle end with a hand that</p>",
        "<p>trembled.</p>\n<p>“Come on,” he said; but he had to clear his</p>\n<p>throat before he could speak in his natural voice.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Phyllis, “if the red-jerseyed one was in the</p>\n<p>way of the train!”</p>\n<p>“We've got to go and see,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Couldn't we go and send someone from the station?” said</p>",
        "<p>Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Would you rather wait here for us?” asked Bobbie, severely,</p>\n<p>and of course that settled the question.</p>\n<p>So the three went on into the deeper darkness of</p>\n<p>the tunnel. Peter led, holding his candle end high to</p>\n<p>light the way. The grease ran down his fingers, and</p>\n<p>some of it right up his sleeve. He found a</p>",
        "<p>long streak from wrist to elbow when he went to</p>\n<p>bed that night.</p>\n<p>It was not more than a hundred and fifty yards</p>\n<p>from the spot where they had stood while the train</p>\n<p>went by that Peter stood still, shouted “Hullo,” and then</p>\n<p>went on much quicker than before. When the others caught</p>\n<p>him up, he stopped. And he stopped within a yard</p>",
        "<p>of what they had come into the tunnel to look</p>\n<p>for. Phyllis saw a gleam of red, and shut her</p>\n<p>eyes tight. There, by the curved, pebbly down line, was</p>\n<p>the red-jerseyed hound. His back was against the wall, his</p>\n<p>arms hung limply by his sides, and his eyes were</p>\n<p>shut.</p>\n<p>“Was the red, blood? Is he all killed?” asked Phyllis,</p>",
        "<p>screwing her eyelids more tightly together.</p>\n<p>“Killed? Nonsense!” said Peter. “There's nothing red about him except</p>\n<p>his jersey. He's only fainted. What on earth are we</p>\n<p>to do?”</p>\n<p>“Can we move him?” asked Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“I don't know; he's a big chap.”</p>\n<p>“Suppose we bathe his forehead with water. No, I know</p>",
        "<p>we haven't any, but milk's just as wet. There's a</p>\n<p>whole bottle.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Peter, “and they rub people's hands, I believe.”</p>\n<p>“They burn feathers, I know,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“What's the good of saying that when we haven't any</p>\n<p>feathers?”</p>\n<p>“As it happens,” said Phyllis, in a tone of exasperated</p>",
        "<p>triumph, “I've got a shuttlecock in my pocket. So there!”</p>\n<p>And now Peter rubbed the hands of the red-jerseyed one.</p>\n<p>Bobbie burned the feathers of the shuttlecock one by one</p>\n<p>under his nose, Phyllis splashed warmish milk on his forehead,</p>\n<p>and all three kept on saying as fast and as</p>\n<p>earnestly as they could:--</p>\n<p>“Oh, look up, speak to me! For my sake, speak!”</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter XII.</h3>\n<p>What Bobbie brought home.</p>\n<p>“Oh, look up! Speak to me! For MY sake, speak!”</p>\n<p>The children said the words over and over again to</p>\n<p>the unconscious hound in a red jersey, who sat with</p>\n<p>closed eyes and pale face against the side of the</p>\n<p>tunnel.</p>\n<p>“Wet his ears with milk,” said Bobbie. “I know they</p>",
        "<p>do it to people that faint--with eau-de-Cologne. But I expect</p>\n<p>milk's just as good.”</p>\n<p>So they wetted his ears, and some of the milk</p>\n<p>ran down his neck under the red jersey. It was</p>\n<p>very dark in the tunnel. The candle end Peter had</p>\n<p>carried, and which now burned on a flat stone, gave</p>\n<p>hardly any light at all.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, DO look up,” said Phyllis. “For MY sake! I</p>\n<p>believe he's dead.”</p>\n<p>“For MY sake,” repeated Bobbie. “No, he isn't.”</p>\n<p>“For ANY sake,” said Peter; “come out of it.” And</p>\n<p>he shook the sufferer by the arm.</p>\n<p>And then the boy in the red jersey sighed, and</p>\n<p>opened his eyes, and shut them again and said in</p>",
        "<p>a very small voice, “Chuck it.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, he's NOT dead,” said Phyllis. “I KNEW he wasn't,”</p>\n<p>and she began to cry.</p>\n<p>“What's up? I'm all right,” said the boy.</p>\n<p>“Drink this,” said Peter, firmly, thrusting the nose of the</p>\n<p>milk bottle into the boy's mouth. The boy struggled, and</p>\n<p>some of the milk was upset before he could get</p>",
        "<p>his mouth free to say:--</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“It's milk,” said Peter. “Fear not, you are in the</p>\n<p>hands of friends. Phil, you stop bleating this minute.”</p>\n<p>“Do drink it,” said Bobbie, gently; “it'll do you good.”</p>\n<p>So he drank. And the three stood by without speaking</p>\n<p>to him.</p>",
        "<p>“Let him be a minute,” Peter whispered; “he'll be all</p>\n<p>right as soon as the milk begins to run like</p>\n<p>fire through his veins.”</p>\n<p>He was.</p>\n<p>“I'm better now,” he announced. “I remember all about it.”</p>\n<p>He tried to move, but the movement ended in a</p>\n<p>groan. “Bother! I believe I've broken my leg,” he said.</p>",
        "<p>“Did you tumble down?” asked Phyllis, sniffing.</p>\n<p>“Of course not--I'm not a kiddie,” said the boy, indignantly;</p>\n<p>“it was one of those beastly wires tripped me up,</p>\n<p>and when I tried to get up again I couldn't</p>\n<p>stand, so I sat down. Gee whillikins! it does hurt,</p>\n<p>though. How did YOU get here?”</p>\n<p>“We saw you all go into the tunnel and then</p>",
        "<p>we went across the hill to see you all come</p>\n<p>out. And the others did--all but you, and you didn't.</p>\n<p>So we are a rescue party,” said Peter, with pride.</p>\n<p>“You've got some pluck, I will say,” remarked the boy.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that's nothing,” said Peter, with modesty. “Do you think</p>\n<p>you could walk if we helped you?”</p>\n<p>“I could try,” said the boy.</p>",
        "<p>He did try. But he could only stand on one</p>\n<p>foot; the other dragged in a very nasty way.</p>\n<p>“Here, let me sit down. I feel like dying,” said</p>\n<p>the boy. “Let go of me--let go, quick--” He lay</p>\n<p>down and closed his eyes. The others looked at each</p>\n<p>other by the dim light of the little candle.</p>\n<p>“What on earth!” said Peter.</p>",
        "<p>“Look here,” said Bobbie, quickly, “you must go and get</p>\n<p>help. Go to the nearest house.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, that's the only thing,” said Peter. “Come on.”</p>\n<p>“If you take his feet and Phil and I take</p>\n<p>his head, we could carry him to the manhole.”</p>\n<p>They did it. It was perhaps as well for the</p>\n<p>sufferer that he had fainted again.</p>",
        "<p>“Now,” said Bobbie, “I'll stay with him. You take the</p>\n<p>longest bit of candle, and, oh--be quick, for this bit</p>\n<p>won't burn long.”</p>\n<p>“I don't think Mother would like me leaving you,” said</p>\n<p>Peter, doubtfully. “Let me stay, and you and Phil go.”</p>\n<p>“No, no,” said Bobbie, “you and Phil go--and lend me</p>\n<p>your knife. I'll try to get his boot off before</p>",
        "<p>he wakes up again.”</p>\n<p>“I hope it's all right what we're doing,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Of course it's right,” said Bobbie, impatiently. “What else WOULD</p>\n<p>you do? Leave him here all alone because it's dark?</p>\n<p>Nonsense. Hurry up, that's all.”</p>\n<p>So they hurried up.</p>\n<p>Bobbie watched their dark figures and the little light of</p>",
        "<p>the little candle with an odd feeling of having come</p>\n<p>to the end of everything. She knew now, she thought,</p>\n<p>what nuns who were bricked up alive in convent walls</p>\n<p>felt like. Suddenly she gave herself a little shake.</p>\n<p>“Don't be a silly little girl,” she said. She was</p>\n<p>always very angry when anyone else called her a little</p>\n<p>girl, even if the adjective that went first was not</p>",
        "<p>“silly” but “nice” or “good” or “clever.” And it was</p>\n<p>only when she was very angry with herself that she</p>\n<p>allowed Roberta to use that expression to Bobbie.</p>\n<p>She fixed the little candle end on a broken brick</p>\n<p>near the red-jerseyed boy's feet. Then she opened Peter's knife.</p>\n<p>It was always hard to manage--a halfpenny was generally needed</p>\n<p>to get it open at all. This time Bobbie somehow</p>",
        "<p>got it open with her thumbnail. She broke the nail,</p>\n<p>and it hurt horribly. Then she cut the boy's bootlace,</p>\n<p>and got the boot off. She tried to pull off</p>\n<p>his stocking, but his leg was dreadfully swollen, and it</p>\n<p>did not seem to be the proper shape. So she</p>\n<p>cut the stocking down, very slowly and carefully. It was</p>\n<p>a brown, knitted stocking, and she wondered who had knitted</p>",
        "<p>it, and whether it was the boy's mother, and whether</p>\n<p>she was feeling anxious about him, and how she would</p>\n<p>feel when he was brought home with his leg broken.</p>\n<p>When Bobbie had got the stocking off and saw the</p>\n<p>poor leg, she felt as though the tunnel was growing</p>\n<p>darker, and the ground felt unsteady, and nothing seemed quite</p>\n<p>real.</p>",
        "<p>“SILLY little girl!” said Roberta to Bobbie, and felt better.</p>\n<p>“The poor leg,” she told herself; “it ought to have</p>\n<p>a cushion--ah!”</p>\n<p>She remembered the day when she and Phyllis had torn</p>\n<p>up their red flannel petticoats to make danger signals to</p>\n<p>stop the train and prevent an accident. Her flannel petticoat</p>\n<p>to-day was white, but it would be quite as soft</p>",
        "<p>as a red one. She took it off.</p>\n<p>“Oh, what useful things flannel petticoats are!” she said; “the</p>\n<p>man who invented them ought to have a statue directed</p>\n<p>to him.” And she said it aloud, because it seemed</p>\n<p>that any voice, even her own, would be a comfort</p>\n<p>in that darkness.</p>\n<p>“WHAT ought to be directed? Who to?” asked the boy,</p>",
        "<p>suddenly and very feebly.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said Bobbie, “now you're better! Hold your teeth and</p>\n<p>don't let it hurt too much. Now!”</p>\n<p>She had folded the petticoat, and lifting his leg laid</p>\n<p>it on the cushion of folded flannel.</p>\n<p>“Don't faint again, PLEASE don't,” said Bobbie, as he groaned.</p>\n<p>She hastily wetted her handkerchief with milk and spread it</p>",
        "<p>over the poor leg.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that hurts,” cried the boy, shrinking. “Oh--no, it doesn't--it's</p>\n<p>nice, really.”</p>\n<p>“What's your name?” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“Jim.”</p>\n<p>“Mine's Bobbie.”</p>\n<p>“But you're a girl, aren't you?”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, my long name's Roberta.”</p>\n<p>“I say--Bobbie.”</p>\n<p>“Yes?”</p>\n<p>“Wasn't there some more of you just now?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Peter and Phil--that's my brother and sister. They've gone</p>\n<p>to get someone to carry you out.”</p>\n<p>“What rum names. All boys'.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes--I wish I was a boy, don't you?”</p>\n<p>“I think you're all right as you are.”</p>\n<p>“I didn't mean that--I meant don't you wish YOU were</p>\n<p>a boy, but of course you are without wishing.”</p>\n<p>“You're just as brave as a boy. Why didn't you</p>\n<p>go with the others?”</p>\n<p>“Somebody had to stay with you,” said Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>“Tell you what, Bobbie,” said Jim, “you're a brick. Shake.”</p>\n<p>He reached out a red-jerseyed arm and Bobbie squeezed his</p>\n<p>hand.</p>\n<p>“I won't shake it,” she explained, “because it would shake</p>\n<p>YOU, and that would shake your poor leg, and that</p>\n<p>would hurt. Have you got a hanky?”</p>\n<p>“I don't expect I have.” He felt in his pocket.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, I have. What for?”</p>\n<p>She took it and wetted it with milk and put</p>\n<p>it on his forehead.</p>\n<p>“That's jolly,” he said; “what is it?”</p>\n<p>“Milk,” said Bobbie. “We haven't any water--”</p>\n<p>“You're a jolly good little nurse,” said Jim.</p>\n<p>“I do it for Mother sometimes,” said Bobbie--“not milk, of</p>",
        "<p>course, but scent, or vinegar and water. I say, I</p>\n<p>must put the candle out now, because there mayn't be</p>\n<p>enough of the other one to get you out by.”</p>\n<p>“By George,” said he, “you think of everything.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie blew. Out went the candle. You have no idea</p>\n<p>how black-velvety the darkness was.</p>\n<p>“I say, Bobbie,” said a voice through the blackness, “aren't</p>",
        "<p>you afraid of the dark?”</p>\n<p>“Not--not very, that is--”</p>\n<p>“Let's hold hands,” said the boy, and it was really</p>\n<p>rather good of him, because he was like most boys</p>\n<p>of his age and hated all material tokens of affection,</p>\n<p>such as kissing and holding of hands. He called all</p>\n<p>such things “pawings,” and detested them.</p>",
        "<p>The darkness was more bearable to Bobbie now that her</p>\n<p>hand was held in the large rough hand of the</p>\n<p>red-jerseyed sufferer; and he, holding her little smooth hot paw,</p>\n<p>was surprised to find that he did not mind it</p>\n<p>so much as he expected. She tried to talk, to</p>\n<p>amuse him, and “take his mind off” his sufferings, but</p>\n<p>it is very difficult to go on talking in the</p>",
        "<p>dark, and presently they found themselves in a silence, only</p>\n<p>broken now and then by a--</p>\n<p>“You all right, Bobbie?”</p>\n<p>or an--</p>\n<p>“I'm afraid it's hurting you most awfully, Jim. I AM</p>\n<p>so sorry.”</p>\n<p>And it was very cold.</p>",
        "<p>* * * * * *</p>\n<p>Peter and Phyllis tramped down the long way of the</p>\n<p>tunnel towards daylight, the candle-grease dripping over Peter's fingers. There</p>\n<p>were no accidents unless you count Phyllis's catching her frock</p>\n<p>on a wire, and tearing a long, jagged slit in</p>\n<p>it, and tripping over her bootlace when it came undone,</p>\n<p>or going down on her hands and knees, all four</p>",
        "<p>of which were grazed.</p>\n<p>“There's no end to this tunnel,” said Phyllis--and indeed it</p>\n<p>did seem very very long.</p>\n<p>“Stick to it,” said Peter; “everything has an end, and</p>\n<p>you get to it if you only keep all on.”</p>\n<p>Which is quite true, if you come to think of</p>\n<p>it, and a useful thing to remember in seasons of</p>",
        "<p>trouble--such as measles, arithmetic, impositions, and those times when you</p>\n<p>are in disgrace, and feel as though no one would</p>\n<p>ever love you again, and you could never--never again--love anybody.</p>\n<p>“Hurray,” said Peter, suddenly, “there's the end of the tunnel--looks</p>\n<p>just like a pin-hole in a bit of black paper,</p>\n<p>doesn't it?”</p>\n<p>The pin-hole got larger--blue lights lay along the sides of</p>",
        "<p>the tunnel. The children could see the gravel way that</p>\n<p>lay in front of them; the air grew warmer and</p>\n<p>sweeter. Another twenty steps and they were out in the</p>\n<p>good glad sunshine with the green trees on both sides.</p>\n<p>Phyllis drew a long breath.</p>\n<p>“I'll never go into a tunnel again as long as</p>\n<p>ever I live,” said she, “not if there are twenty</p>",
        "<p>hundred thousand millions hounds inside with red jerseys and their</p>\n<p>legs broken.”</p>\n<p>“Don't be a silly cuckoo,” said Peter, as usual. “You'd</p>\n<p>HAVE to.”</p>\n<p>“I think it was very brave and good of me,”</p>\n<p>said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Not it,” said Peter; “you didn't go because you were</p>",
        "<p>brave, but because Bobbie and I aren't skunks. Now where's</p>\n<p>the nearest house, I wonder? You can't see anything here</p>\n<p>for the trees.”</p>\n<p>“There's a roof over there,” said Phyllis, pointing down the</p>\n<p>line.</p>\n<p>“That's the signal-box,” said Peter, “and you know you're not</p>\n<p>allowed to speak to signalmen on duty. It's wrong.”</p>",
        "<p>“I'm not near so afraid of doing wrong as I</p>\n<p>was of going into that tunnel,” said Phyllis. “Come on,”</p>\n<p>and she started to run along the line. So Peter</p>\n<p>ran, too.</p>\n<p>It was very hot in the sunshine, and both children</p>\n<p>were hot and breathless by the time they stopped, and</p>\n<p>bending their heads back to look up at the open</p>",
        "<p>windows of the signal-box, shouted “Hi!” as loud as their</p>\n<p>breathless state allowed. But no one answered. The signal-box stood</p>\n<p>quiet as an empty nursery, and the handrail of its</p>\n<p>steps was hot to the hands of the children as</p>\n<p>they climbed softly up. They peeped in at the open</p>\n<p>door. The signalman was sitting on a chair tilted back</p>\n<p>against the wall. His head leaned sideways, and his mouth</p>",
        "<p>was open. He was fast asleep.</p>\n<p>“My hat!” cried Peter; “wake up!” And he cried it</p>\n<p>in a terrible voice, for he knew that if a</p>\n<p>signalman sleeps on duty, he risks losing his situation, let</p>\n<p>alone all the other dreadful risks to trains which expect</p>\n<p>him to tell them when it is safe for them</p>\n<p>to go their ways.</p>",
        "<p>The signalman never moved. Then Peter sprang to him and</p>\n<p>shook him. And slowly, yawning and stretching, the man awoke.</p>\n<p>But the moment he WAS awake he leapt to his</p>\n<p>feet, put his hands to his head “like a mad</p>\n<p>maniac,” as Phyllis said afterwards, and shouted:--</p>\n<p>“Oh, my heavens--what's o'clock?”</p>\n<p>“Twelve thirteen,” said Peter, and indeed it was by the</p>",
        "<p>white-faced, round-faced clock on the wall of the signal-box.</p>\n<p>The man looked at the clock, sprang to the levers,</p>\n<p>and wrenched them this way and that. An electric bell</p>\n<p>tingled--the wires and cranks creaked, and the man threw himself</p>\n<p>into a chair. He was very pale, and the sweat</p>\n<p>stood on his forehead “like large dewdrops on a white</p>\n<p>cabbage,” as Phyllis remarked later. He was trembling, too; the</p>",
        "<p>children could see his big hairy hands shake from side</p>\n<p>to side, “with quite extra-sized trembles,” to use the subsequent</p>\n<p>words of Peter. He drew long breaths. Then suddenly he</p>\n<p>cried, “Thank God, thank God you come in when you</p>\n<p>did--oh, thank God!” and his shoulders began to heave and</p>\n<p>his face grew red again, and he hid it in</p>\n<p>those large hairy hands of his.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, don't cry--don't,” said Phyllis, “it's all right now,” and</p>\n<p>she patted him on one big, broad shoulder, while Peter</p>\n<p>conscientiously thumped the other.</p>\n<p>But the signalman seemed quite broken down, and the children</p>\n<p>had to pat him and thump him for quite a</p>\n<p>long time before he found his handkerchief--a red one with</p>\n<p>mauve and white horseshoes on it--and mopped his face and</p>",
        "<p>spoke. During this patting and thumping interval a train thundered</p>\n<p>by.</p>\n<p>“I'm downright shamed, that I am,” were the words of</p>\n<p>the big signalman when he had stopped crying; “snivelling like</p>\n<p>a kid.” Then suddenly he seemed to get cross. “And</p>\n<p>what was you doing up here, anyway?” he said; “you</p>\n<p>know it ain't allowed.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” said Phyllis, “we knew it was wrong--but I wasn't</p>\n<p>afraid of doing wrong, and so it turned out right.</p>\n<p>You aren't sorry we came.”</p>\n<p>“Lor' love you--if you hadn't 'a' come--” he stopped and</p>\n<p>then went on. “It's a disgrace, so it is, sleeping</p>\n<p>on duty. If it was to come to be known--even</p>\n<p>as it is, when no harm's come of it.”</p>",
        "<p>“It won't come to be known,” said Peter; “we aren't</p>\n<p>sneaks. All the same, you oughtn't to sleep on duty--it's</p>\n<p>dangerous.”</p>\n<p>“Tell me something I don't know,” said the man, “but</p>\n<p>I can't help it. I know'd well enough just how</p>\n<p>it 'ud be. But I couldn't get off. They couldn't</p>\n<p>get no one to take on my duty. I tell</p>",
        "<p>you I ain't had ten minutes' sleep this last five</p>\n<p>days. My little chap's ill--pewmonia, the Doctor says--and there's no</p>\n<p>one but me and 'is little sister to do for</p>\n<p>him. That's where it is. The gell must 'ave her</p>\n<p>sleep. Dangerous? Yes, I believe you. Now go and split</p>\n<p>on me if you like.”</p>\n<p>“Of course we won't,” said Peter, indignantly, but Phyllis ignored</p>",
        "<p>the whole of the signalman's speech, except the first six</p>\n<p>words.</p>\n<p>“You asked us,” she said, “to tell you something you</p>\n<p>don't know. Well, I will. There's a boy in the</p>\n<p>tunnel over there with a red jersey and his leg</p>\n<p>broken.”</p>\n<p>“What did he want to go into the blooming tunnel</p>",
        "<p>for, then?” said the man.</p>\n<p>“Don't you be so cross,” said Phyllis, kindly. “WE haven't</p>\n<p>done anything wrong except coming and waking you up, and</p>\n<p>that was right, as it happens.”</p>\n<p>Then Peter told how the boy came to be in</p>\n<p>the tunnel.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the man, “I don't see as I can</p>",
        "<p>do anything. I can't leave the box.”</p>\n<p>“You might tell us where to go after someone who</p>\n<p>isn't in a box, though,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“There's Brigden's farm over yonder--where you see the smoke a-coming</p>\n<p>up through the trees,” said the man, more and more</p>\n<p>grumpy, as Phyllis noticed.</p>\n<p>“Well, good-bye, then,” said Peter.</p>",
        "<p>But the man said, “Wait a minute.” He put his</p>\n<p>hand in his pocket and brought out some money--a lot</p>\n<p>of pennies and one or two shillings and sixpences and</p>\n<p>half-a-crown. He picked out two shillings and held them out.</p>\n<p>“Here,” he said. “I'll give you this to hold your</p>\n<p>tongues about what's taken place to-day.”</p>\n<p>There was a short, unpleasant pause. Then:--</p>",
        "<p>“You ARE a nasty man, though, aren't you?” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>Peter took a step forward and knocked the man's hand</p>\n<p>up, so that the shillings leapt out of it and</p>\n<p>rolled on the floor.</p>\n<p>“If anything COULD make me sneak, THAT would!” he said.</p>\n<p>“Come, Phil,” and marched out of the signal-box with flaming</p>\n<p>cheeks.</p>",
        "<p>Phyllis hesitated. Then she took the hand, still held out</p>\n<p>stupidly, that the shillings had been in.</p>\n<p>“I forgive you,” she said, “even if Peter doesn't. You're</p>\n<p>not in your proper senses, or you'd never have done</p>\n<p>that. I know want of sleep sends people mad. Mother</p>\n<p>told me. I hope your little boy will soon be</p>\n<p>better, and--”</p>",
        "<p>“Come on, Phil,” cried Peter, eagerly.</p>\n<p>“I give you my sacred honour-word we'll never tell anyone.</p>\n<p>Kiss and be friends,” said Phyllis, feeling how noble it</p>\n<p>was of her to try to make up a quarrel</p>\n<p>in which she was not to blame.</p>\n<p>The signalman stooped and kissed her.</p>\n<p>“I do believe I'm a bit off my head, Sissy,”</p>",
        "<p>he said. “Now run along home to Mother. I didn't</p>\n<p>mean to put you about--there.”</p>\n<p>So Phil left the hot signal-box and followed Peter across</p>\n<p>the fields to the farm.</p>\n<p>When the farm men, led by Peter and Phyllis and</p>\n<p>carrying a hurdle covered with horse-cloths, reached the manhole in</p>\n<p>the tunnel, Bobbie was fast asleep and so was Jim.</p>",
        "<p>Worn out with the pain, the Doctor said afterwards.</p>\n<p>“Where does he live?” the bailiff from the farm asked,</p>\n<p>when Jim had been lifted on to the hurdle.</p>\n<p>“In Northumberland,” answered Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“I'm at school at Maidbridge,” said Jim. “I suppose I've</p>\n<p>got to get back there, somehow.”</p>\n<p>“Seems to me the Doctor ought to have a look</p>",
        "<p>in first,” said the bailiff.</p>\n<p>“Oh, bring him up to our house,” said Bobbie. “It's</p>\n<p>only a little way by the road. I'm sure Mother</p>\n<p>would say we ought to.”</p>\n<p>“Will your Ma like you bringing home strangers with broken</p>\n<p>legs?”</p>\n<p>“She took the poor Russian home herself,” said Bobbie. “I</p>",
        "<p>know she'd say we ought.”</p>\n<p>“All right,” said the bailiff, “you ought to know what</p>\n<p>your Ma 'ud like. I wouldn't take it upon me</p>\n<p>to fetch him up to our place without I asked</p>\n<p>the Missus first, and they call me the Master, too.”</p>\n<p>“Are you sure your Mother won't mind?” whispered Jim.</p>\n<p>“Certain,” said Bobbie.</p>",
        "<p>“Then we're to take him up to Three Chimneys?” said</p>\n<p>the bailiff.</p>\n<p>“Of course,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Then my lad shall nip up to Doctor's on his</p>\n<p>bike, and tell him to come down there. Now, lads,</p>\n<p>lift him quiet and steady. One, two, three!”</p>\n<p>* * * * * *</p>",
        "<p>Thus it happened that Mother, writing away for dear life</p>\n<p>at a story about a Duchess, a designing villain, a</p>\n<p>secret passage, and a missing will, dropped her pen as</p>\n<p>her work-room door burst open, and turned to see Bobbie</p>\n<p>hatless and red with running.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Mother,” she cried, “do come down. We found a</p>\n<p>hound in a red jersey in the tunnel, and he's</p>",
        "<p>broken his leg and they're bringing him home.”</p>\n<p>“They ought to take him to the vet,” said Mother,</p>\n<p>with a worried frown; “I really CAN'T have a lame</p>\n<p>dog here.”</p>\n<p>“He's not a dog, really--he's a boy,” said Bobbie, between</p>\n<p>laughing and choking.</p>\n<p>“Then he ought to be taken home to his mother.”</p>",
        "<p>“His mother's dead,” said Bobbie, “and his father's in Northumberland.</p>\n<p>Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him? I told</p>\n<p>him I was sure you'd want us to bring him</p>\n<p>home. You always want to help everybody.”</p>\n<p>Mother smiled, but she sighed, too. It is nice that</p>\n<p>your children should believe you willing to open house and</p>\n<p>heart to any and every one who needs help. But</p>",
        "<p>it is rather embarrassing sometimes, too, when they act on</p>\n<p>their belief.</p>\n<p>“Oh, well,” said Mother, “we must make the best of</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>When Jim was carried in, dreadfully white and with set</p>\n<p>lips whose red had faded to a horrid bluey violet</p>\n<p>colour, Mother said:--</p>",
        "<p>“I am glad you brought him here. Now, Jim, let's</p>\n<p>get you comfortable in bed before the Doctor comes!”</p>\n<p>And Jim, looking at her kind eyes, felt a little,</p>\n<p>warm, comforting flush of new courage.</p>\n<p>“It'll hurt rather, won't it?” he said. “I don't mean</p>\n<p>to be a coward. You won't think I'm a coward</p>\n<p>if I faint again, will you? I really and truly</p>",
        "<p>don't do it on purpose. And I do hate to</p>\n<p>give you all this trouble.”</p>\n<p>“Don't you worry,” said Mother; “it's you that have the</p>\n<p>trouble, you poor dear--not us.”</p>\n<p>And she kissed him just as if he had been</p>\n<p>Peter. “We love to have you here--don't we, Bobbie?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bobbie--and she saw by her Mother's face how</p>",
        "<p>right she had been to bring home the wounded hound</p>\n<p>in the red jersey.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter XIII.</h3>\n<p>The hound's grandfather.</p>\n<p>Mother did not get back to her writing all that</p>\n<p>day, for the red-jerseyed hound whom the children had brought</p>\n<p>to Three Chimneys had to be put to bed. And</p>\n<p>then the Doctor came, and hurt him most horribly. Mother</p>\n<p>was with him all through it, and that made it</p>\n<p>a little better than it would have been, but “bad</p>",
        "<p>was the best,” as Mrs. Viney said.</p>\n<p>The children sat in the parlour downstairs and heard the</p>\n<p>sound of the Doctor's boots going backwards and forwards over</p>\n<p>the bedroom floor. And once or twice there was a</p>\n<p>groan.</p>\n<p>“It's horrible,” said Bobbie. “Oh, I wish Dr. Forrest would</p>\n<p>make haste. Oh, poor Jim!”</p>",
        "<p>“It IS horrible,” said Peter, “but it's very exciting. I</p>\n<p>wish Doctors weren't so stuck-up about who they'll have in</p>\n<p>the room when they're doing things. I should most awfully</p>\n<p>like to see a leg set. I believe the bones</p>\n<p>crunch like anything.”</p>\n<p>“Don't!” said the two girls at once.</p>\n<p>“Rubbish!” said Peter. “How are you going to be Red</p>",
        "<p>Cross Nurses, like you were talking of coming home, if</p>\n<p>you can't even stand hearing me say about bones crunching?</p>\n<p>You'd have to HEAR them crunch on the field of</p>\n<p>battle--and be steeped in gore up to the elbows as</p>\n<p>likely as not, and--”</p>\n<p>“Stop it!” cried Bobbie, with a white face; “you don't</p>\n<p>know how funny you're making me feel.”</p>",
        "<p>“Me, too,” said Phyllis, whose face was pink.</p>\n<p>“Cowards!” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“I'm not,” said Bobbie. “I helped Mother with your rake-wounded</p>\n<p>foot, and so did Phil--you know we did.”</p>\n<p>“Well, then!” said Peter. “Now look here. It would be</p>\n<p>a jolly good thing for you if I were to</p>\n<p>talk to you every day for half an hour about</p>",
        "<p>broken bones and people's insides, so as to get you</p>\n<p>used to it.”</p>\n<p>A chair was moved above.</p>\n<p>“Listen,” said Peter, “that's the bone crunching.”</p>\n<p>“I do wish you wouldn't,” said Phyllis. “Bobbie doesn't like</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“I'll tell you what they do,” said Peter. I can't</p>",
        "<p>think what made him so horrid. Perhaps it was because</p>\n<p>he had been so very nice and kind all the</p>\n<p>earlier part of the day, and now he had to</p>\n<p>have a change. This is called reaction. One notices it</p>\n<p>now and then in oneself. Sometimes when one has been</p>\n<p>extra good for a longer time than usual, one is</p>\n<p>suddenly attacked by a violent fit of not being good</p>",
        "<p>at all. “I'll tell you what they do,” said Peter;</p>\n<p>“they strap the broken man down so that he can't</p>\n<p>resist or interfere with their doctorish designs, and then someone</p>\n<p>holds his head, and someone holds his leg--the broken one,</p>\n<p>and pulls it till the bones fit in--with a crunch,</p>\n<p>mind you! Then they strap it up and--let's play at</p>\n<p>bone-setting!”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, no!” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>But Bobbie said suddenly: “All right--LET'S! I'll be the doctor,</p>\n<p>and Phil can be the nurse. You can be the</p>\n<p>broken boner; we can get at your legs more easily,</p>\n<p>because you don't wear petticoats.”</p>\n<p>“I'll get the splints and bandages,” said Peter; “you get</p>\n<p>the couch of suffering ready.”</p>",
        "<p>The ropes that had tied up the boxes that had</p>\n<p>come from home were all in a wooden packing-case in</p>\n<p>the cellar. When Peter brought in a trailing tangle of</p>\n<p>them, and two boards for splints, Phyllis was excitedly giggling.</p>\n<p>“Now, then,” he said, and lay down on the settle,</p>\n<p>groaning most grievously.</p>\n<p>“Not so loud!” said Bobbie, beginning to wind the rope</p>",
        "<p>round him and the settle. “You pull, Phil.”</p>\n<p>“Not so tight,” moaned Peter. “You'll break my other leg.”</p>\n<p>Bobbie worked on in silence, winding more and more rope</p>\n<p>round him.</p>\n<p>“That's enough,” said Peter. “I can't move at all. Oh,</p>\n<p>my poor leg!” He groaned again.</p>\n<p>“SURE you can't move?” asked Bobbie, in a rather strange</p>",
        "<p>tone.</p>\n<p>“Quite sure,” replied Peter. “Shall we play it's bleeding freely</p>\n<p>or not?” he asked cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“YOU can play what you like,” said Bobbie, sternly, folding</p>\n<p>her arms and looking down at him where he lay</p>\n<p>all wound round and round with cord. “Phil and I</p>\n<p>are going away. And we shan't untie you till you</p>",
        "<p>promise never, never to talk to us about blood and</p>\n<p>wounds unless we say you may. Come, Phil!”</p>\n<p>“You beast!” said Peter, writhing. “I'll never promise, never. I'll</p>\n<p>yell, and Mother will come.”</p>\n<p>“Do,” said Bobbie, “and tell her why we tied you</p>\n<p>up! Come on, Phil. No, I'm not a beast, Peter.</p>\n<p>But you wouldn't stop when we asked you and--”</p>",
        "<p>“Yah,” said Peter, “it wasn't even your own idea. You</p>\n<p>got it out of Stalky!”</p>\n<p>Bobbie and Phil, retiring in silent dignity, were met at</p>\n<p>the door by the Doctor. He came in rubbing his</p>\n<p>hands and looking pleased with himself.</p>\n<p>“Well,” he said, “THAT job's done. It's a nice clean</p>\n<p>fracture, and it'll go on all right, I've no doubt.</p>",
        "<p>Plucky young chap, too--hullo! what's all this?”</p>\n<p>His eye had fallen on Peter who lay mousy-still in</p>\n<p>his bonds on the settle.</p>\n<p>“Playing at prisoners, eh?” he said; but his eyebrows had</p>\n<p>gone up a little. Somehow he had not thought that</p>\n<p>Bobbie would be playing while in the room above someone</p>\n<p>was having a broken bone set.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, no!” said Bobbie, “not at PRISONERS. We were playing</p>\n<p>at setting bones. Peter's the broken boner, and I was</p>\n<p>the doctor.”</p>\n<p>The Doctor frowned.</p>\n<p>“Then I must say,” he said, and he said it</p>\n<p>rather sternly, “that's it's a very heartless game. Haven't you</p>\n<p>enough imagination even to faintly picture what's been going on</p>",
        "<p>upstairs? That poor chap, with the drops of sweat on</p>\n<p>his forehead, and biting his lips so as not to</p>\n<p>cry out, and every touch on his leg agony and--”</p>\n<p>“YOU ought to be tied up,” said Phyllis; “you're as</p>\n<p>bad as--”</p>\n<p>“Hush,” said Bobbie; “I'm sorry, but we weren't heartless, really.”</p>\n<p>“I was, I suppose,” said Peter, crossly. “All right, Bobbie,</p>",
        "<p>don't you go on being noble and screening me, because</p>\n<p>I jolly well won't have it. It was only that</p>\n<p>I kept on talking about blood and wounds. I wanted</p>\n<p>to train them for Red Cross Nurses. And I wouldn't</p>\n<p>stop when they asked me.”</p>\n<p>“Well?” said Dr. Forrest, sitting down.</p>\n<p>“Well--then I said, 'Let's play at setting bones.' It was</p>",
        "<p>all rot. I knew Bobbie wouldn't. I only said it</p>\n<p>to tease her. And then when she said 'yes,' of</p>\n<p>course I had to go through with it. And they</p>\n<p>tied me up. They got it out of Stalky. And</p>\n<p>I think it's a beastly shame.”</p>\n<p>He managed to writhe over and hide his face against</p>\n<p>the wooden back of the settle.</p>",
        "<p>“I didn't think that anyone would know but us,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie, indignantly answering Peter's unspoken reproach. “I never thought of</p>\n<p>your coming in. And hearing about blood and wounds does</p>\n<p>really make me feel most awfully funny. It was only</p>\n<p>a joke our tying him up. Let me untie you,</p>\n<p>Pete.”</p>\n<p>“I don't care if you never untie me,” said Peter;</p>",
        "<p>“and if that's your idea of a joke--”</p>\n<p>“If I were you,” said the Doctor, though really he</p>\n<p>did not quite know what to say, “I should be</p>\n<p>untied before your Mother comes down. You don't want to</p>\n<p>worry her just now, do you?”</p>\n<p>“I don't promise anything about not saying about wounds, mind,”</p>\n<p>said Peter, in very surly tones, as Bobbie and Phyllis</p>",
        "<p>began to untie the knots.</p>\n<p>“I'm very sorry, Pete,” Bobbie whispered, leaning close to him</p>\n<p>as she fumbled with the big knot under the settle;</p>\n<p>“but if you only knew how sick you made me</p>\n<p>feel.”</p>\n<p>“You've made ME feel pretty sick, I can tell you,”</p>\n<p>Peter rejoined. Then he shook off the loose cords, and</p>",
        "<p>stood up.</p>\n<p>“I looked in,” said Dr. Forrest, “to see if one</p>\n<p>of you would come along to the surgery. There are</p>\n<p>some things that your Mother will want at once, and</p>\n<p>I've given my man a day off to go and</p>\n<p>see the circus; will you come, Peter?”</p>\n<p>Peter went without a word or a look to his</p>",
        "<p>sisters.</p>\n<p>The two walked in silence up to the gate that</p>\n<p>led from the Three Chimneys field to the road. Then</p>\n<p>Peter said:--</p>\n<p>“Let me carry your bag. I say, it is heavy--what's</p>\n<p>in it?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, knives and lancets and different instruments for hurting people.</p>",
        "<p>And the ether bottle. I had to give him ether,</p>\n<p>you know--the agony was so intense.”</p>\n<p>Peter was silent.</p>\n<p>“Tell me all about how you found that chap,” said</p>\n<p>Dr. Forrest.</p>\n<p>Peter told. And then Dr. Forrest told him stories of</p>\n<p>brave rescues; he was a most interesting man to talk</p>",
        "<p>to, as Peter had often remarked.</p>\n<p>Then in the surgery Peter had a better chance than</p>\n<p>he had ever had of examining the Doctor's balance, and</p>\n<p>his microscope, and his scales and measuring glasses. When all</p>\n<p>the things were ready that Peter was to take back,</p>\n<p>the Doctor said suddenly:--</p>\n<p>“You'll excuse my shoving my oar in, won't you? But</p>",
        "<p>I should like to say something to you.”</p>\n<p>“Now for a rowing,” thought Peter, who had been wondering</p>\n<p>how it was that he had escaped one.</p>\n<p>“Something scientific,” added the Doctor.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Peter, fiddling with the fossil ammonite that the</p>\n<p>Doctor used for a paper-weight.</p>\n<p>“Well then, you see. Boys and girls are only little</p>",
        "<p>men and women. And WE are much harder and hardier</p>\n<p>than they are--” (Peter liked the “we.” Perhaps the Doctor</p>\n<p>had known he would.)--“and much stronger, and things that hurt</p>\n<p>THEM don't hurt US. You know you mustn't hit a</p>\n<p>girl--”</p>\n<p>“I should think not, indeed,” muttered Peter, indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Not even if she's your own sister. That's because girls</p>",
        "<p>are so much softer and weaker than we are; they</p>\n<p>have to be, you know,” he added, “because if they</p>\n<p>weren't, it wouldn't be nice for the babies. And that's</p>\n<p>why all the animals are so good to the mother</p>\n<p>animals. They never fight them, you know.”</p>\n<p>“I know,” said Peter, interested; “two buck rabbits will fight</p>\n<p>all day if you let them, but they won't hurt</p>",
        "<p>a doe.”</p>\n<p>“No; and quite wild beasts--lions and elephants--they're immensely gentle with</p>\n<p>the female beasts. And we've got to be, too.”</p>\n<p>“I see,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“And their hearts are soft, too,” the Doctor went on,</p>\n<p>“and things that we shouldn't think anything of hurt them</p>\n<p>dreadfully. So that a man has to be very careful,</p>",
        "<p>not only of his fists, but of his words. They're</p>\n<p>awfully brave, you know,” he went on. “Think of Bobbie</p>\n<p>waiting alone in the tunnel with that poor chap. It's</p>\n<p>an odd thing--the softer and more easily hurt a woman</p>\n<p>is the better she can screw herself up to do</p>\n<p>what HAS to be done. I've seen some brave women--your</p>\n<p>Mother's one,” he ended abruptly.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Well, that's all. Excuse my mentioning it. But nobody knows</p>\n<p>everything without being told. And you see what I mean,</p>\n<p>don't you?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Peter. “I'm sorry. There!”</p>\n<p>“Of course you are! People always are--directly they understand. Everyone</p>\n<p>ought to be taught these scientific facts. So long!”</p>",
        "<p>They shook hands heartily. When Peter came home, his sisters</p>\n<p>looked at him doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“It's Pax,” said Peter, dumping down the basket on the</p>\n<p>table. “Dr. Forrest has been talking scientific to me. No,</p>\n<p>it's no use my telling you what he said; you</p>\n<p>wouldn't understand. But it all comes to you girls being</p>\n<p>poor, soft, weak, frightened things like rabbits, so us men</p>",
        "<p>have just got to put up with them. He said</p>\n<p>you were female beasts. Shall I take this up to</p>\n<p>Mother, or will you?”</p>\n<p>“I know what BOYS are,” said Phyllis, with flaming cheeks;</p>\n<p>“they're just the nastiest, rudest--”</p>\n<p>“They're very brave,” said Bobbie, “sometimes.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you mean the chap upstairs? I see. Go ahead,</p>",
        "<p>Phil--I shall put up with you whatever you say because</p>\n<p>you're a poor, weak, frightened, soft--”</p>\n<p>“Not if I pull your hair you won't,” said Phyllis,</p>\n<p>springing at him.</p>\n<p>“He said 'Pax,'” said Bobbie, pulling her away. “Don't you</p>\n<p>see,” she whispered as Peter picked up the basket and</p>\n<p>stalked out with it, “he's sorry, really, only he won't</p>",
        "<p>say so? Let's say we're sorry.”</p>\n<p>“It's so goody goody,” said Phyllis, doubtfully; “he said we</p>\n<p>were female beasts, and soft and frightened--”</p>\n<p>“Then let's show him we're not frightened of him thinking</p>\n<p>us goody goody,” said Bobbie; “and we're not any more</p>\n<p>beasts than he is.”</p>\n<p>And when Peter came back, still with his chin in</p>",
        "<p>the air, Bobbie said:--</p>\n<p>“We're sorry we tied you up, Pete.”</p>\n<p>“I thought you would be,” said Peter, very stiff and</p>\n<p>superior.</p>\n<p>This was hard to bear. But--</p>\n<p>“Well, so we are,” said Bobbie. “Now let honour be</p>\n<p>satisfied on both sides.”</p>",
        "<p>“I did call it Pax,” said Peter, in an injured</p>\n<p>tone.</p>\n<p>“Then let it BE Pax,” said Bobbie. “Come on, Phil,</p>\n<p>let's get the tea. Pete, you might lay the cloth.”</p>\n<p>“I say,” said Phyllis, when peace was really restored, which</p>\n<p>was not till they were washing up the cups after</p>\n<p>tea, “Dr. Forrest didn't REALLY say we were female beasts,</p>",
        "<p>did he?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Peter, firmly, “but I think he meant we</p>\n<p>men were wild beasts, too.”</p>\n<p>“How funny of him!” said Phyllis, breaking a cup.</p>\n<p>* * * * * *</p>\n<p>“May I come in, Mother?” Peter was at the door</p>\n<p>of Mother's writing room, where Mother sat at her table</p>",
        "<p>with two candles in front of her. Their flames looked</p>\n<p>orange and violet against the clear grey blue of the</p>\n<p>sky where already a few stars were twinkling.</p>\n<p>“Yes, dear,” said Mother, absently, “anything wrong?” She wrote a</p>\n<p>few more words and then laid down her pen and</p>\n<p>began to fold up what she had written. “I was</p>\n<p>just writing to Jim's grandfather. He lives near here, you</p>",
        "<p>know.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you said so at tea. That's what I want</p>\n<p>to say. Must you write to him, Mother? Couldn't we</p>\n<p>keep Jim, and not say anything to his people till</p>\n<p>he's well? It would be such a surprise for them.”</p>\n<p>“Well, yes,” said Mother, laughing, “I think it would.”</p>\n<p>“You see,” Peter went on, “of course the girls are</p>",
        "<p>all right and all that--I'm not saying anything against THEM.</p>\n<p>But I should like it if I had another chap</p>\n<p>to talk to sometimes.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Mother, “I know it's dull for you, dear.</p>\n<p>But I can't help it. Next year perhaps I can</p>\n<p>send you to school--you'd like that, wouldn't you?”</p>\n<p>“I do miss the other chaps, rather,” Peter confessed; “but</p>",
        "<p>if Jim could stay after his leg was well, we</p>\n<p>could have awful larks.”</p>\n<p>“I've no doubt of it,” said Mother. “Well--perhaps he could,</p>\n<p>but you know, dear, we're not rich. I can't afford</p>\n<p>to get him everything he'll want. And he must have</p>\n<p>a nurse.”</p>\n<p>“Can't you nurse him, Mother? You do nurse people so</p>",
        "<p>beautifully.”</p>\n<p>“That's a pretty compliment, Pete--but I can't do nursing and</p>\n<p>my writing as well. That's the worst of it.”</p>\n<p>“Then you MUST send the letter to his grandfather?”</p>\n<p>“Of course--and to his schoolmaster, too. We telegraphed to them</p>\n<p>both, but I must write as well. They'll be most</p>\n<p>dreadfully anxious.”</p>",
        "<p>“I say, Mother, why can't his grandfather pay for a</p>\n<p>nurse?” Peter suggested. “That would be ripping. I expect the</p>\n<p>old boy's rolling in money. Grandfathers in books always are.”</p>\n<p>“Well, this one isn't in a book,” said Mother, “so</p>\n<p>we mustn't expect him to roll much.”</p>\n<p>“I say,” said Peter, musingly, “wouldn't it be jolly if</p>\n<p>we all WERE in a book, and you were writing</p>",
        "<p>it? Then you could make all sorts of jolly things</p>\n<p>happen, and make Jim's legs get well at once and</p>\n<p>be all right to-morrow, and Father come home soon and--”</p>\n<p>“Do you miss your Father very much?” Mother asked, rather</p>\n<p>coldly, Peter thought.</p>\n<p>“Awfully,” said Peter, briefly.</p>\n<p>Mother was enveloping and addressing the second letter.</p>",
        "<p>“You see,” Peter went on slowly, “you see, it's not</p>\n<p>only him BEING Father, but now he's away there's no</p>\n<p>other man in the house but me--that's why I want</p>\n<p>Jim to stay so frightfully much. Wouldn't you like to</p>\n<p>be writing that book with us all in it, Mother,</p>\n<p>and make Daddy come home soon?”</p>\n<p>Peter's Mother put her arm round him suddenly, and hugged</p>",
        "<p>him in silence for a minute. Then she said:--</p>\n<p>“Don't you think it's rather nice to think that we're</p>\n<p>in a book that God's writing? If I were writing</p>\n<p>the book, I might make mistakes. But God knows how</p>\n<p>to make the story end just right--in the way that's</p>\n<p>best for us.”</p>\n<p>“Do you really believe that, Mother?” Peter asked quietly.</p>",
        "<p>“Yes,” she said, “I do believe it--almost always--except when I'm</p>\n<p>so sad that I can't believe anything. But even when</p>\n<p>I can't believe it, I know it's true--and I try</p>\n<p>to believe. You don't know how I try, Peter. Now</p>\n<p>take the letters to the post, and don't let's be</p>\n<p>sad any more. Courage, courage! That's the finest of all</p>\n<p>the virtues! I dare say Jim will be here for</p>",
        "<p>two or three weeks yet.”</p>\n<p>For what was left of the evening Peter was so</p>\n<p>angelic that Bobbie feared he was going to be ill.</p>\n<p>She was quite relieved in the morning to find him</p>\n<p>plaiting Phyllis's hair on to the back of her chair</p>\n<p>in quite his old manner.</p>\n<p>It was soon after breakfast that a knock came at</p>",
        "<p>the door. The children were hard at work cleaning the</p>\n<p>brass candlesticks in honour of Jim's visit.</p>\n<p>“That'll be the Doctor,” said Mother; “I'll go. Shut the</p>\n<p>kitchen door--you're not fit to be seen.”</p>\n<p>But it wasn't the Doctor. They knew that by the</p>\n<p>voice and by the sound of the boots that went</p>\n<p>upstairs. They did not recognise the sound of the boots,</p>",
        "<p>but everyone was certain that they had heard the voice</p>\n<p>before.</p>\n<p>There was a longish interval. The boots and the voice</p>\n<p>did not come down again.</p>\n<p>“Who can it possibly be?” they kept on asking themselves</p>\n<p>and each other.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps,” said Peter at last, “Dr. Forrest has been attacked</p>",
        "<p>by highwaymen and left for dead, and this is the</p>\n<p>man he's telegraphed for to take his place. Mrs. Viney</p>\n<p>said he had a local tenant to do his work</p>\n<p>when he went for a holiday, didn't you, Mrs. Viney?”</p>\n<p>“I did so, my dear,” said Mrs. Viney from the</p>\n<p>back kitchen.</p>\n<p>“He's fallen down in a fit, more likely,” said Phyllis,</p>",
        "<p>“all human aid despaired of. And this is his man</p>\n<p>come to break the news to Mother.”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense!” said Peter, briskly; “Mother wouldn't have taken the man</p>\n<p>up into Jim's bedroom. Why should she? Listen--the door's opening.</p>\n<p>Now they'll come down. I'll open the door a crack.”</p>\n<p>He did.</p>\n<p>“It's not listening,” he replied indignantly to Bobbie's scandalised remarks;</p>",
        "<p>“nobody in their senses would talk secrets on the stairs.</p>\n<p>And Mother can't have secrets to talk with Dr. Forrest's</p>\n<p>stable-man--and you said it was him.”</p>\n<p>“Bobbie,” called Mother's voice.</p>\n<p>They opened the kitchen door, and Mother leaned over the</p>\n<p>stair railing.</p>\n<p>“Jim's grandfather has come,” she said; “wash your hands and</p>",
        "<p>faces and then you can see him. He wants to</p>\n<p>see you!” The bedroom door shut again.</p>\n<p>“There now!” said Peter; “fancy us not even thinking of</p>\n<p>that! Let's have some hot water, Mrs. Viney. I'm as</p>\n<p>black as your hat.”</p>\n<p>The three were indeed dirty, for the stuff you clean</p>\n<p>brass candlesticks with is very far from cleaning to the</p>",
        "<p>cleaner.</p>\n<p>They were still busy with soap and flannel when they</p>\n<p>heard the boots and the voice come down the stairs</p>\n<p>and go into the dining-room. And when they were clean,</p>\n<p>though still damp--because it takes such a long time to</p>\n<p>dry your hands properly, and they were very impatient to</p>\n<p>see the grandfather--they filed into the dining-room.</p>",
        "<p>Mother was sitting in the window-seat, and in the leather-covered</p>\n<p>armchair that Father always used to sit in at the</p>\n<p>other house sat--</p>\n<p>THEIR OWN OLD GENTLEMAN!</p>\n<p>“Well, I never did,” said Peter, even before he said,</p>\n<p>“How do you do?” He was, as he explained afterwards,</p>\n<p>too surprised even to remember that there was such a</p>",
        "<p>thing as politeness--much less to practise it.</p>\n<p>“It's our own old gentleman!” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it's you!” said Bobbie. And then they remembered themselves</p>\n<p>and their manners and said, “How do you do?” very</p>\n<p>nicely.</p>\n<p>“This is Jim's grandfather, Mr. ----” said Mother, naming the</p>\n<p>old gentleman's name.</p>",
        "<p>“How splendid!” said Peter; “that's just exactly like a book,</p>\n<p>isn't it, Mother?”</p>\n<p>“It is, rather,” said Mother, smiling; “things do happen in</p>\n<p>real life that are rather like books, sometimes.”</p>\n<p>“I am so awfully glad it IS you,” said Phyllis;</p>\n<p>“when you think of the tons of old gentlemen there</p>\n<p>are in the world--it might have been almost anyone.”</p>",
        "<p>“I say, though,” said Peter, “you're not going to take</p>\n<p>Jim away, though, are you?”</p>\n<p>“Not at present,” said the old gentleman. “Your Mother has</p>\n<p>most kindly consented to let him stay here. I thought</p>\n<p>of sending a nurse, but your Mother is good enough</p>\n<p>to say that she will nurse him herself.”</p>\n<p>“But what about her writing?” said Peter, before anyone could</p>",
        "<p>stop him. “There won't be anything for him to eat</p>\n<p>if Mother doesn't write.”</p>\n<p>“That's all right,” said Mother, hastily.</p>\n<p>The old gentleman looked very kindly at Mother.</p>\n<p>“I see,” he said, “you trust your children, and confide</p>\n<p>in them.”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” said Mother.</p>",
        "<p>“Then I may tell them of our little arrangement,” he</p>\n<p>said. “Your Mother, my dears, has consented to give up</p>\n<p>writing for a little while and to become a Matron</p>\n<p>of my Hospital.”</p>\n<p>“Oh!” said Phyllis, blankly; “and shall we have to go</p>\n<p>away from Three Chimneys and the Railway and everything?”</p>\n<p>“No, no, darling,” said Mother, hurriedly.</p>",
        "<p>“The Hospital is called Three Chimneys Hospital,” said the old</p>\n<p>gentleman, “and my unlucky Jim's the only patient, and I</p>\n<p>hope he'll continue to be so. Your Mother will be</p>\n<p>Matron, and there'll be a hospital staff of a housemaid</p>\n<p>and a cook--till Jim's well.”</p>\n<p>“And then will Mother go on writing again?” asked Peter.</p>\n<p>“We shall see,” said the old gentleman, with a slight,</p>",
        "<p>swift glance at Bobbie; “perhaps something nice may happen and</p>\n<p>she won't have to.”</p>\n<p>“I love my writing,” said Mother, very quickly.</p>\n<p>“I know,” said the old gentleman; “don't be afraid that</p>\n<p>I'm going to try to interfere. But one never knows.</p>\n<p>Very wonderful and beautiful things do happen, don't they? And</p>\n<p>we live most of our lives in the hope of</p>",
        "<p>them. I may come again to see the boy?”</p>\n<p>“Surely,” said Mother, “and I don't know how to thank</p>\n<p>you for making it possible for me to nurse him.</p>\n<p>Dear boy!”</p>\n<p>“He kept calling Mother, Mother, in the night,” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“I woke up twice and heard him.”</p>\n<p>“He didn't mean me,” said Mother, in a low voice</p>",
        "<p>to the old gentleman; “that's why I wanted so much</p>\n<p>to keep him.”</p>\n<p>The old gentleman rose.</p>\n<p>“I'm so glad,” said Peter, “that you're going to keep</p>\n<p>him, Mother.”</p>\n<p>“Take care of your Mother, my dears,” said the old</p>\n<p>gentleman. “She's a woman in a million.”</p>",
        "<p>“Yes, isn't she?” whispered Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“God bless her,” said the old gentleman, taking both Mother's</p>\n<p>hands, “God bless her! Ay, and she shall be blessed.</p>\n<p>Dear me, where's my hat? Will Bobbie come with me</p>\n<p>to the gate?”</p>\n<p>At the gate he stopped and said:--</p>\n<p>“You're a good child, my dear--I got your letter. But</p>",
        "<p>it wasn't needed. When I read about your Father's case</p>\n<p>in the papers at the time, I had my doubts.</p>\n<p>And ever since I've known who you were, I've been</p>\n<p>trying to find out things. I haven't done very much</p>\n<p>yet. But I have hopes, my dear--I have hopes.”</p>\n<p>“Oh!” said Bobbie, choking a little.</p>\n<p>“Yes--I may say great hopes. But keep your secret a</p>",
        "<p>little longer. Wouldn't do to upset your Mother with a</p>\n<p>false hope, would it?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, but it isn't false!” said Bobbie; “I KNOW you</p>\n<p>can do it. I knew you could when I wrote.</p>\n<p>It isn't a false hope, is it?”</p>\n<p>“No,” he said, “I don't think it's a false hope,</p>\n<p>or I wouldn't have told you. And I think you</p>",
        "<p>deserve to be told that there IS a hope.”</p>\n<p>“And you don't think Father did it, do you? Oh,</p>\n<p>say you don't think he did.”</p>\n<p>“My dear,” he said, “I'm perfectly CERTAIN he didn't.”</p>\n<p>If it was a false hope, it was none the</p>\n<p>less a very radiant one that lay warm at Bobbie's</p>\n<p>heart, and through the days that followed lighted her little</p>",

        "<h3>Chapter XIV.</h3>\n<p>The End.</p>\n<p>Life at the Three Chimneys was never quite the same</p>\n<p>again after the old gentleman came to see his grandson.</p>\n<p>Although they now knew his name, the children never spoke</p>\n<p>of him by it--at any rate, when they were by</p>\n<p>themselves. To them he was always the old gentleman, and</p>\n<p>I think he had better be the old gentleman to</p>",
        "<p>us, too. It wouldn't make him seem any more real</p>\n<p>to you, would it, if I were to tell you</p>\n<p>that his name was Snooks or Jenkins (which it wasn't)?--and,</p>\n<p>after all, I must be allowed to keep one secret.</p>\n<p>It's the only one; I have told you everything else,</p>\n<p>except what I am going to tell you in this</p>\n<p>chapter, which is the last. At least, of course, I</p>",
        "<p>haven't told you EVERYTHING. If I were to do that,</p>\n<p>the book would never come to an end, and that</p>\n<p>would be a pity, wouldn't it?</p>\n<p>Well, as I was saying, life at Three Chimneys was</p>\n<p>never quite the same again. The cook and the housemaid</p>\n<p>were very nice (I don't mind telling you their names--they</p>\n<p>were Clara and Ethelwyn), but they told Mother they did</p>",
        "<p>not seem to want Mrs. Viney, and that she was</p>\n<p>an old muddler. So Mrs. Viney came only two days</p>\n<p>a week to do washing and ironing. Then Clara and</p>\n<p>Ethelwyn said they could do the work all right if</p>\n<p>they weren't interfered with, and that meant that the children</p>\n<p>no longer got the tea and cleared it away and</p>\n<p>washed up the tea-things and dusted the rooms.</p>",
        "<p>This would have left quite a blank in their lives,</p>\n<p>although they had often pretended to themselves and to each</p>\n<p>other that they hated housework. But now that Mother had</p>\n<p>no writing and no housework to do, she had time</p>\n<p>for lessons. And lessons the children had to do. However</p>\n<p>nice the person who is teaching you may be, lessons</p>\n<p>are lessons all the world over, and at their best</p>",
        "<p>are worse fun than peeling potatoes or lighting a fire.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if Mother now had time for</p>\n<p>lessons, she also had time for play, and to make</p>\n<p>up little rhymes for the children as she used to</p>\n<p>do. She had not had much time for rhymes since</p>\n<p>she came to Three Chimneys.</p>\n<p>There was one very odd thing about these lessons. Whatever</p>",
        "<p>the children were doing, they always wanted to be doing</p>\n<p>something else. When Peter was doing his Latin, he thought</p>\n<p>it would be nice to be learning History like Bobbie.</p>\n<p>Bobbie would have preferred Arithmetic, which was what Phyllis happened</p>\n<p>to be doing, and Phyllis of course thought Latin much</p>\n<p>the most interesting kind of lesson. And so on.</p>\n<p>So, one day, when they sat down to lessons, each</p>",
        "<p>of them found a little rhyme at its place. I</p>\n<p>put the rhymes in to show you that their Mother</p>\n<p>really did understand a little how children feel about things,</p>\n<p>and also the kind of words they use, which is</p>\n<p>the case with very few grown-up people. I suppose most</p>\n<p>grown-ups have very bad memories, and have forgotten how they</p>\n<p>felt when they were little. Of course, the verses are</p>",
        "<p>supposed to be spoken by the children.</p>\n<p>PETER</p>\n<p>I once thought Caesar easy pap-- How very soft I</p>\n<p>must have been! When they start Caesar with a chap</p>\n<p>He little know what that will mean. Oh, verbs are</p>\n<p>silly stupid things. I'd rather learn the dates of kings!</p>\n<p>BOBBIE</p>",
        "<p>The worst of all my lesson things Is learning who</p>\n<p>succeeded who In all the rows of queens and kings,</p>\n<p>With dates to everything they do: With dates enough to</p>\n<p>make you sick;-- I wish it was Arithmetic!</p>\n<p>PHYLLIS</p>\n<p>Such pounds and pounds of apples fill My slate--what is</p>\n<p>the price you'd spend? You scratch the figures out until</p>",
        "<p>You cry upon the dividend. I'd break the slate and</p>\n<p>scream for joy If I did Latin like a boy!</p>\n<p>This kind of thing, of course, made lessons much jollier.</p>\n<p>It is something to know that the person who is</p>\n<p>teaching you sees that it is not all plain sailing</p>\n<p>for you, and does not think that it is just</p>\n<p>your stupidness that makes you not know your lessons till</p>",
        "<p>you've learned them!</p>\n<p>Then as Jim's leg got better it was very pleasant</p>\n<p>to go up and sit with him and hear tales</p>\n<p>about his school life and the other boys. There was</p>\n<p>one boy, named Parr, of whom Jim seemed to have</p>\n<p>formed the lowest possible opinion, and another boy named Wigsby</p>\n<p>Minor, for whose views Jim had a great respect. Also</p>",
        "<p>there were three brothers named Paley, and the youngest was</p>\n<p>called Paley Terts, and was much given to fighting.</p>\n<p>Peter drank in all this with deep joy, and Mother</p>\n<p>seemed to have listened with some interest, for one day</p>\n<p>she gave Jim a sheet of paper on which she</p>\n<p>had written a rhyme about Parr, bringing in Paley and</p>\n<p>Wigsby by name in a most wonderful way, as well</p>",
        "<p>as all the reasons Jim had for not liking Parr,</p>\n<p>and Wigsby's wise opinion on the matter. Jim was immensely</p>\n<p>pleased. He had never had a rhyme written expressly for</p>\n<p>him before. He read it till he knew it by</p>\n<p>heart and then he sent it to Wigsby, who liked</p>\n<p>it almost as much as Jim did. Perhaps you may</p>\n<p>like it, too.</p>",
        "<p>THE NEW BOY</p>\n<p>His name is Parr: he says that he Is given</p>\n<p>bread and milk for tea. He says his father killed</p>\n<p>a bear. He says his mother cuts his hair.</p>\n<p>He wears goloshes when it's wet. I've heard his people</p>\n<p>call him “Pet”! He has no proper sense of shame;</p>\n<p>He told the chaps his Christian name.</p>",
        "<p>He cannot wicket-keep at all, He's frightened of a cricket</p>\n<p>ball. He reads indoors for hours and hours. He knows</p>\n<p>the names of beastly flowers.</p>\n<p>He says his French just like Mossoo-- A beastly stuck-up</p>\n<p>thing to do-- He won't keep _cave_, shirks his turn</p>\n<p>And says he came to school to learn!</p>\n<p>He won't play football, says it hurts; He wouldn't fight</p>",
        "<p>with Paley Terts; He couldn't whistle if he tried, And</p>\n<p>when we laughed at him he cried!</p>\n<p>Now Wigsby Minor says that Parr Is only like all</p>\n<p>new boys are. I know when _I_ first came to</p>\n<p>school I wasn't such a jolly fool!</p>\n<p>Jim could never understand how Mother could have been clever</p>\n<p>enough to do it. To the others it seemed nice,</p>",
        "<p>but natural. You see they had always been used to</p>\n<p>having a mother who could write verses just like the</p>\n<p>way people talk, even to the shocking expression at the</p>\n<p>end of the rhyme, which was Jim's very own.</p>\n<p>Jim taught Peter to play chess and draughts and dominoes,</p>\n<p>and altogether it was a nice quiet time.</p>\n<p>Only Jim's leg got better and better, and a general</p>",
        "<p>feeling began to spring up among Bobbie, Peter, and Phyllis</p>\n<p>that something ought to be done to amuse him; not</p>\n<p>just games, but something really handsome. But it was extraordinarily</p>\n<p>difficult to think of anything.</p>\n<p>“It's no good,” said Peter, when all of them had</p>\n<p>thought and thought till their heads felt quite heavy and</p>\n<p>swollen; “if we can't think of anything to amuse him,</p>",
        "<p>we just can't, and there's an end of it. Perhaps</p>\n<p>something will just happen of its own accord that he'll</p>\n<p>like.”</p>\n<p>“Things DO happen by themselves sometimes, without your making them,”</p>\n<p>said Phyllis, rather as though, usually, everything that happened in</p>\n<p>the world was her doing.</p>\n<p>“I wish something would happen,” said Bobbie, dreamily, “something wonderful.”</p>",
        "<p>And something wonderful did happen exactly four days after she</p>\n<p>had said this. I wish I could say it was</p>\n<p>three days after, because in fairy tales it is always</p>\n<p>three days after that things happen. But this is not</p>\n<p>a fairy story, and besides, it really was four and</p>\n<p>not three, and I am nothing if not strictly truthful.</p>\n<p>They seemed to be hardly Railway children at all in</p>",
        "<p>those days, and as the days went on each had</p>\n<p>an uneasy feeling about this which Phyllis expressed one day.</p>\n<p>“I wonder if the Railway misses us,” she said, plaintively.</p>\n<p>“We never go to see it now.”</p>\n<p>“It seems ungrateful,” said Bobbie; “we loved it so when</p>\n<p>we hadn't anyone else to play with.”</p>\n<p>“Perks is always coming up to ask after Jim,” said</p>",
        "<p>Peter, “and the signalman's little boy is better. He told</p>\n<p>me so.”</p>\n<p>“I didn't mean the people,” explained Phyllis; “I meant the</p>\n<p>dear Railway itself.”</p>\n<p>“The thing I don't like,” said Bobbie, on this fourth</p>\n<p>day, which was a Tuesday, “is our having stopped waving</p>\n<p>to the 9.15 and sending our love to Father by</p>",
        "<p>it.”</p>\n<p>“Let's begin again,” said Phyllis. And they did.</p>\n<p>Somehow the change of everything that was made by having</p>\n<p>servants in the house and Mother not doing any writing,</p>\n<p>made the time seem extremely long since that strange morning</p>\n<p>at the beginning of things, when they had got up</p>\n<p>so early and burnt the bottom out of the kettle</p>",
        "<p>and had apple pie for breakfast and first seen the</p>\n<p>Railway.</p>\n<p>It was September now, and the turf on the slope</p>\n<p>to the Railway was dry and crisp. Little long grass</p>\n<p>spikes stood up like bits of gold wire, frail blue</p>\n<p>harebells trembled on their tough, slender stalks, Gipsy roses opened</p>\n<p>wide and flat their lilac-coloured discs, and the golden stars</p>",
        "<p>of St. John's Wort shone at the edges of the</p>\n<p>pool that lay halfway to the Railway. Bobbie gathered a</p>\n<p>generous handful of the flowers and thought how pretty they</p>\n<p>would look lying on the green-and-pink blanket of silk-waste that</p>\n<p>now covered Jim's poor broken leg.</p>\n<p>“Hurry up,” said Peter, “or we shall miss the 9.15!”</p>\n<p>“I can't hurry more than I am doing,” said Phyllis.</p>",
        "<p>“Oh, bother it! My bootlace has come undone AGAIN!”</p>\n<p>“When you're married,” said Peter, “your bootlace will come undone</p>\n<p>going up the church aisle, and your man that you're</p>\n<p>going to get married to will tumble over it and</p>\n<p>smash his nose in on the ornamented pavement; and then</p>\n<p>you'll say you won't marry him, and you'll have to</p>\n<p>be an old maid.”</p>",
        "<p>“I shan't,” said Phyllis. “I'd much rather marry a man</p>\n<p>with his nose smashed in than not marry anybody.”</p>\n<p>“It would be horrid to marry a man with a</p>\n<p>smashed nose, all the same,” went on Bobbie. “He wouldn't</p>\n<p>be able to smell the flowers at the wedding. Wouldn't</p>\n<p>that be awful!”</p>\n<p>“Bother the flowers at the wedding!” cried Peter. “Look! the</p>",
        "<p>signal's down. We must run!”</p>\n<p>They ran. And once more they waved their handkerchiefs, without</p>\n<p>at all minding whether the handkerchiefs were clean or not,</p>\n<p>to the 9.15.</p>\n<p>“Take our love to Father!” cried Bobbie. And the others,</p>\n<p>too, shouted:--</p>\n<p>“Take our love to Father!”</p>",
        "<p>The old gentleman waved from his first-class carriage window. Quite</p>\n<p>violently he waved. And there was nothing odd in that,</p>\n<p>for he always had waved. But what was really remarkable</p>\n<p>was that from every window handkerchiefs fluttered, newspapers signalled, hands</p>\n<p>waved wildly. The train swept by with a rustle and</p>\n<p>roar, the little pebbles jumped and danced under it as</p>\n<p>it passed, and the children were left looking at each</p>",
        "<p>other.</p>\n<p>“Well!” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“WELL!” said Bobbie.</p>\n<p>“_WELL!_” said Phyllis.</p>\n<p>“Whatever on earth does that mean?” asked Peter, but he</p>\n<p>did not expect any answer.</p>\n<p>“_I_ don't know,” said Bobbie. “Perhaps the old gentleman told</p>",
        "<p>the people at his station to look out for us</p>\n<p>and wave. He knew we should like it!”</p>\n<p>Now, curiously enough, this was just what had happened. The</p>\n<p>old gentleman, who was very well known and respected at</p>\n<p>his particular station, had got there early that morning, and</p>\n<p>he had waited at the door where the young man</p>\n<p>stands holding the interesting machine that clips the tickets, and</p>",
        "<p>he had said something to every single passenger who passed</p>\n<p>through that door. And after nodding to what the old</p>\n<p>gentleman had said--and the nods expressed every shade of surprise,</p>\n<p>interest, doubt, cheerful pleasure, and grumpy agreement--each passenger had gone</p>\n<p>on to the platform and read one certain part of</p>\n<p>his newspaper. And when the passengers got into the train,</p>\n<p>they had told the other passengers who were already there</p>",
        "<p>what the old gentleman had said, and then the other</p>\n<p>passengers had also looked at their newspapers and seemed very</p>\n<p>astonished and, mostly, pleased. Then, when the train passed the</p>\n<p>fence where the three children were, newspapers and hands and</p>\n<p>handkerchiefs were waved madly, till all that side of the</p>\n<p>train was fluttery with white like the pictures of the</p>\n<p>King's Coronation in the biograph at Maskelyne and Cook's. To</p>",
        "<p>the children it almost seemed as though the train itself</p>\n<p>was alive, and was at last responding to the love</p>\n<p>that they had given it so freely and so long.</p>\n<p>“It is most extraordinarily rum!” said Peter.</p>\n<p>“Most stronery!” echoed Phyllis.</p>\n<p>But Bobbie said, “Don't you think the old gentleman's waves</p>\n<p>seemed more significating than usual?”</p>",
        "<p>“No,” said the others.</p>\n<p>“I do,” said Bobbie. “I thought he was trying to</p>\n<p>explain something to us with his newspaper.”</p>\n<p>“Explain what?” asked Peter, not unnaturally.</p>\n<p>“_I_ don't know,” Bobbie answered, “but I do feel most</p>\n<p>awfully funny. I feel just exactly as if something was</p>\n<p>going to happen.”</p>",
        "<p>“What is going to happen,” said Peter, “is that Phyllis's</p>\n<p>stocking is going to come down.”</p>\n<p>This was but too true. The suspender had given way</p>\n<p>in the agitation of the waves to the 9.15. Bobbie's</p>\n<p>handkerchief served as first aid to the injured, and they</p>\n<p>all went home.</p>\n<p>Lessons were more than usually difficult to Bobbie that day.</p>",
        "<p>Indeed, she disgraced herself so deeply over a quite simple</p>\n<p>sum about the division of 48 pounds of meat and</p>\n<p>36 pounds of bread among 144 hungry children that Mother</p>\n<p>looked at her anxiously.</p>\n<p>“Don't you feel quite well, dear?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“I don't know,” was Bobbie's unexpected answer. “I don't know</p>\n<p>how I feel. It isn't that I'm lazy. Mother, will</p>",
        "<p>you let me off lessons to-day? I feel as if</p>\n<p>I wanted to be quite alone by myself.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, of course I'll let you off,” said Mother; “but--”</p>\n<p>Bobbie dropped her slate. It cracked just across the little</p>\n<p>green mark that is so useful for drawing patterns round,</p>\n<p>and it was never the same slate again. Without waiting</p>\n<p>to pick it up she bolted. Mother caught her in</p>",
        "<p>the hall feeling blindly among the waterproofs and umbrellas for</p>\n<p>her garden hat.</p>\n<p>“What is it, my sweetheart?” said Mother. “You don't feel</p>\n<p>ill, do you?”</p>\n<p>“I DON'T know,” Bobbie answered, a little breathlessly, “but I</p>\n<p>want to be by myself and see if my head</p>\n<p>really IS all silly and my inside all squirmy-twisty.”</p>",
        "<p>“Hadn't you better lie down?” Mother said, stroking her hair</p>\n<p>back from her forehead.</p>\n<p>“I'd be more alive in the garden, I think,” said</p>\n<p>Bobbie.</p>\n<p>But she could not stay in the garden. The hollyhocks</p>\n<p>and the asters and the late roses all seemed to</p>\n<p>be waiting for something to happen. It was one of</p>",
        "<p>those still, shiny autumn days, when everything does seem to</p>\n<p>be waiting.</p>\n<p>Bobbie could not wait.</p>\n<p>“I'll go down to the station,” she said, “and talk</p>\n<p>to Perks and ask about the signalman's little boy.”</p>\n<p>So she went down. On the way she passed the</p>\n<p>old lady from the Post-office, who gave her a kiss</p>",
        "<p>and a hug, but, rather to Bobbie's surprise, no words</p>\n<p>except:--</p>\n<p>“God bless you, love--” and, after a pause, “run along--do.”</p>\n<p>The draper's boy, who had sometimes been a little less</p>\n<p>than civil and a little more than contemptuous, now touched</p>\n<p>his cap, and uttered the remarkable words:--</p>\n<p>“'Morning, Miss, I'm sure--”</p>",
        "<p>The blacksmith, coming along with an open newspaper in his</p>\n<p>hand, was even more strange in his manner. He grinned</p>\n<p>broadly, though, as a rule, he was a man not</p>\n<p>given to smiles, and waved the newspaper long before he</p>\n<p>came up to her. And as he passed her, he</p>\n<p>said, in answer to her “Good morning”:--</p>\n<p>“Good morning to you, Missie, and many of them! I</p>",
        "<p>wish you joy, that I do!”</p>\n<p>“Oh!” said Bobbie to herself, and her heart quickened its</p>\n<p>beats, “something IS going to happen! I know it is--everyone</p>\n<p>is so odd, like people are in dreams.”</p>\n<p>The Station Master wrung her hand warmly. In fact he</p>\n<p>worked it up and down like a pump-handle. But he</p>\n<p>gave her no reason for this unusually enthusiastic greeting. He</p>",
        "<p>only said:--</p>\n<p>“The 11.54's a bit late, Miss--the extra luggage this holiday</p>\n<p>time,” and went away very quickly into that inner Temple</p>\n<p>of his into which even Bobbie dared not follow him.</p>\n<p>Perks was not to be seen, and Bobbie shared the</p>\n<p>solitude of the platform with the Station Cat. This tortoiseshell</p>\n<p>lady, usually of a retiring disposition, came to-day to rub</p>",
        "<p>herself against the brown stockings of Bobbie with arched back,</p>\n<p>waving tail, and reverberating purrs.</p>\n<p>“Dear me!” said Bobbie, stooping to stroke her, “how very</p>\n<p>kind everybody is to-day--even you, Pussy!”</p>\n<p>Perks did not appear until the 11.54 was signalled, and</p>\n<p>then he, like everybody else that morning, had a newspaper</p>\n<p>in his hand.</p>",
        "<p>“Hullo!” he said, “'ere you are. Well, if THIS is</p>\n<p>the train, it'll be smart work! Well, God bless you,</p>\n<p>my dear! I see it in the paper, and I</p>\n<p>don't think I was ever so glad of anything in</p>\n<p>all my born days!” He looked at Bobbie a moment,</p>\n<p>then said, “One I must have, Miss, and no offence,</p>\n<p>I know, on a day like this 'ere!” and with</p>",
        "<p>that he kissed her, first on one cheek and then</p>\n<p>on the other.</p>\n<p>“You ain't offended, are you?” he asked anxiously. “I ain't</p>\n<p>took too great a liberty? On a day like this,</p>\n<p>you know--”</p>\n<p>“No, no,” said Bobbie, “of course it's not a liberty,</p>\n<p>dear Mr. Perks; we love you quite as much as</p>",
        "<p>if you were an uncle of ours--but--on a day like</p>\n<p>WHAT?”</p>\n<p>“Like this 'ere!” said Perks. “Don't I tell you I</p>\n<p>see it in the paper?”</p>\n<p>“Saw WHAT in the paper?” asked Bobbie, but already the</p>\n<p>11.54 was steaming into the station and the Station Master</p>\n<p>was looking at all the places where Perks was not</p>",
        "<p>and ought to have been.</p>\n<p>Bobbie was left standing alone, the Station Cat watching her</p>\n<p>from under the bench with friendly golden eyes.</p>\n<p>Of course you know already exactly what was going to</p>\n<p>happen. Bobbie was not so clever. She had the vague,</p>\n<p>confused, expectant feeling that comes to one's heart in dreams.</p>\n<p>What her heart expected I can't tell--perhaps the very thing</p>",
        "<p>that you and I know was going to happen--but her</p>\n<p>mind expected nothing; it was almost blank, and felt nothing</p>\n<p>but tiredness and stupidness and an empty feeling, like your</p>\n<p>body has when you have been a long walk and</p>\n<p>it is very far indeed past your proper dinner-time.</p>\n<p>Only three people got out of the 11.54. The first</p>\n<p>was a countryman with two baskety boxes full of live</p>",
        "<p>chickens who stuck their russet heads out anxiously through the</p>\n<p>wicker bars; the second was Miss Peckitt, the grocer's wife's</p>\n<p>cousin, with a tin box and three brown-paper parcels; and</p>\n<p>the third--</p>\n<p>“Oh! my Daddy, my Daddy!” That scream went like a</p>\n<p>knife into the heart of everyone in the train, and</p>\n<p>people put their heads out of the windows to see</p>",
        "<p>a tall pale man with lips set in a thin</p>\n<p>close line, and a little girl clinging to him with</p>\n<p>arms and legs, while his arms went tightly round her.</p>\n<p>* * * * * *</p>\n<p>“I knew something wonderful was going to happen,” said Bobbie,</p>\n<p>as they went up the road, “but I didn't think</p>\n<p>it was going to be this. Oh, my Daddy, my</p>",
        "<p>Daddy!”</p>\n<p>“Then didn't Mother get my letter?” Father asked.</p>\n<p>“There weren't any letters this morning. Oh! Daddy! it IS</p>\n<p>really you, isn't it?”</p>\n<p>The clasp of a hand she had not forgotten assured</p>\n<p>her that it was. “You must go in by yourself,</p>\n<p>Bobbie, and tell Mother quite quietly that it's all right.</p>",
        "<p>They've caught the man who did it. Everyone knows now</p>\n<p>that it wasn't your Daddy.”</p>\n<p>“_I_ always knew it wasn't,” said Bobbie. “Me and Mother</p>\n<p>and our old gentleman.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” he said, “it's all his doing. Mother wrote and</p>\n<p>told me you had found out. And she told me</p>\n<p>what you'd been to her. My own little girl!” They</p>",
        "<p>stopped a minute then.</p>\n<p>And now I see them crossing the field. Bobbie goes</p>\n<p>into the house, trying to keep her eyes from speaking</p>\n<p>before her lips have found the right words to “tell</p>\n<p>Mother quite quietly” that the sorrow and the struggle and</p>\n<p>the parting are over and done, and that Father has</p>\n<p>come home.</p>",
        "<p>I see Father walking in the garden, waiting--waiting.

At the end of the field, among</p>\n<p>the thin gold spikes of grass and the harebells and</p>\n<p>Gipsy roses and St. John's Wort, we may just take</p>",
