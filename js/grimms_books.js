        "<h3>FOREWORD</h3>\n<p>To our American boys and girls is offered this volume which is really</p>\n<p>Grimm’s _Fairy Tales_, not an abridgment superficial and colorless, nor</p>\n<p>an insipid retelling of the stories.</p>\n<p>This edition is based on the Hunt version, with an introduction by</p>\n<p>the folk-lorist, Andrew Lang.</p>\n<p>The Hunt version is considered a most</p>\n",
        "<p>accurate English translation.</p>\n<p>From the full collection, fifty-one stories suitable for children have</p>\n<p>been selected.</p>\n<p>Among these are famous tales as well as many delightful</p>\n<p>ones not usually included in children’s volumes.</p>\n<p>Where the Hunt wording is too stilted, the text of the _Hausmärchen_</p>\n<p>itself has been followed.</p>\n",
        "<p>The very long sentences have been subdivided.</p>\n<p>While that quaint old-fashioned translation, illustrated with woodcuts</p>\n<p>by Wehnert, has contributed its bit of folk phraseology.</p>\n<p>The Editor’s</p>\n<p>desire is to restore to the children as large a collection as possible</p>\n<p>of Grimm’s _Fairy Tales_ unmutilated in their literary perfection.</p>\n<p>The illustrations are by the well-known Dutch artist, Mrs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Rie Cramer.</p>\n<p>Some of Rie Cramer’s other fairy tale pictures published in England,</p>\n<p>are said by admiring critics there, to be very charming, of exceptional</p>\n<p>merit, and to have high artistic merit of their own.</p>\n<p>Her illustrations for Grimm are particularly harmonious in color,</p>\n<p>while their quaint charm grows on one more and more as one lives with</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n",
        "<p>They are fanciful or humorous.</p>\n<p>They have the quality, rare in</p>\n<p>fairy tales, of actually illustrating their text.</p>\n<p>This will mean added</p>\n<p>pleasure to the children.</p>\n<p>Rie Cramer’s little black and white headings</p>\n<p>are particularly pretty and graceful in outline.</p>\n",
        "<p>The tales are presented here in their original form, with nothing left</p>\n<p>out of child-heartedness, humor, poetic feeling, and delicate sentiment</p>\n<p>and fancy.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it is all here--the poesy and purity which those</p>\n<p>profound and child-loving scholars, the Brothers Grimm, retained in the</p>\n<p>old folk-tales which, with so much pains, they gathered largely from</p>\n<p>among the peasant-folk themselves.</p>\n",
        "<p>And the Brothers explained, in their preface, that they had planned the</p>\n<p>volume as an educational book as well as one for scholars; for which</p>\n<p>reason they had eliminated everything which they feared might harm the</p>\n<p>children.</p>\n<p>But since the Brothers issued their book, about a hundred</p>\n<p>years ago, educational requirements of what is ethically best for</p>\n<p>children have materially advanced.</p>\n",
        "<p>Therefore, in this book, a few other</p>\n<p>parts unsuitable for children have been omitted.</p>\n<p>So now this volume of Grimm’s _Fairy Tales_ is offered to our American</p>\n<p>boys and girls; and may they have continued delight in the beautiful</p>\n<p>old folk-fictions, which have come down to us from the fresh and</p>\n<p>sparkling meadows and woods of ancient days.</p>\n<p>Fathers and mothers, too, will enjoy reading the tales aloud and</p>\n",
        "<p>sharing with the children the humor and the deep but simple ethical</p>\n<p>truths so tenderly and poetically set forth therein.</p>\n<p>Teachers and story-tellers, also, may find in this sincere version,</p>\n<p>rich material for kindling the imagination and feeding the poetic fancy</p>\n<p>of their pupils.</p>\n<p>The Editor,</p>\n<h3>FRANCES JENKINS OLCOTT.</h3>\n",

        "<p>lime-tree in the forest, was a fountain.</p>\n<p>When the day was very warm,</p>\n<p>the King’s Child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of</p>\n<p>the cool fountain, and when she was dull she took a golden ball, and</p>\n<p>threw it up in the air and caught it.</p>\n<p>And this ball was her favorite</p>\n<p>plaything.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now, it so happened one day, the King’s Daughter’s golden ball did not</p>\n<p>fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to</p>\n<p>the ground, and rolled straight into the water.</p>\n<p>The King’s Daughter</p>\n<p>followed it with her eyes; but it vanished, and the well was deep, so</p>\n<p>deep that the bottom could not be seen.</p>\n<p>On this she began to cry, and</p>\n",
        "<p>cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted.</p>\n<p>And as she thus lamented, some one said to her, “What ails you, King’s</p>\n<p>Daughter?</p>\n<p>You weep so that even a stone would show pity.”</p>\n<p>She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw</p>\n<p>a Frog stretching its thick, ugly head from the water.</p>\n<p>“Ah!</p>\n",
        "<p>old</p>\n<p>water-splasher, is it you?” said she; “I am weeping for my golden ball,</p>\n<p>which has fallen into the fountain.”</p>\n<p>“Be quiet, and do not weep,” answered the Frog, “I can help you.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>what will you give me if I bring your plaything up again?”</p>\n<p>“Whatever you will have, dear Frog,” said she--“my clothes, my pearls</p>\n",
        "<p>and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.”</p>\n<p>The Frog answered, “I do not care for your clothes, your pearls and</p>\n<p>jewels, or your golden crown, but if you will love me and let me be</p>\n<p>your companion and playfellow, and sit by you at your little table, and</p>\n<p>eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of your little cup, and</p>\n<p>sleep in your little bed--if you will promise me this, I will go down</p>\n<p>below, and bring your golden ball up again.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh, yes,” said she, “I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring</p>\n<p>my ball back again.” She, however, thought, “How the silly Frog does</p>\n<p>talk!</p>\n<p>He lives in the water with the other frogs and croaks, and can be</p>\n<p>no companion to any human being!”</p>\n<p>But the Frog, when he had received this promise, put his head into the</p>\n<p>water and sank down.</p>\n",
        "<p>In a short time he came swimming up again with</p>\n<p>the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.</p>\n<p>The King’s Daughter</p>\n<p>was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up,</p>\n<p>and ran away with it.</p>\n<p>“Wait, wait,” said the Frog.</p>\n<p>“Take me with you.</p>\n",
        "<p>I can’t run as you</p>\n<p>can.” But what did it avail him to scream his _croak, croak,_ after</p>\n<p>her, as loudly as he could?</p>\n<p>She did not listen to it, but ran home and</p>\n<p>soon forgot the poor Frog, who was forced to go back into his fountain</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>The next day, when she had seated herself at table with the King</p>\n",
        "<p>and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate,</p>\n<p>something came creeping _splish splash, splish splash,_ up the marble</p>\n<p>staircase.</p>\n<p>When it got to the top, it knocked at the door, and cried:</p>\n<p>“_King’s Daughter, youngest.</p>\n<p>Open the door!_”</p>\n<p>She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat</p>\n",
        "<p>the Frog in front of it.</p>\n<p>Then she slammed the door in great haste, sat</p>\n<p>down to dinner again, and was quite frightened.</p>\n<p>The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said,</p>\n<p>“My Child, what are you so afraid of?</p>\n<p>Is there a Giant outside who</p>\n<p>wants to carry you away?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ah, no,” replied she, “it is no Giant, but a disgusting Frog.”</p>\n<p>“What does the Frog want with you?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, dear Father, yesterday when I was in the forest sitting by the</p>\n<p>fountain, playing, my golden ball fell into the water.</p>\n<p>And because I</p>\n<p>cried so, the Frog brought it out again for me.</p>\n<p>And because he insisted</p>\n",
        "<p>so on it, I promised him he should be my companion; but I never thought</p>\n<p>he would be able to come out of the water!</p>\n<p>And now he is here, and</p>\n<p>wants to come in.”</p>\n<p>In the meantime, it knocked a second time, and cried:</p>\n<p>“_King’s Daughter, youngest!</p>\n<p>Open to me!</p>\n",

        "<p>and let him in.”</p>\n<p>She went and opened the door, and the Frog hopped in and followed her,</p>\n<p>step by step, to her chair.</p>\n<p>There he sat still and cried, “Lift me up</p>\n<p>beside you.”</p>\n<p>She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it.</p>\n<p>When the</p>\n",
        "<p>Frog was once on the chair, he wanted to be on the table, and when he</p>\n<p>was on the table, he said, “Now, push your little golden plate nearer</p>\n<p>to me that we may eat together.”</p>\n<p>She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.</p>\n<p>The Frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took,</p>\n<p>choked her.</p>\n<p>At length he said, “I have eaten and am satisfied.</p>\n",

        "<p>So</p>\n<p>she called all seven to her and said, “Dear Children, I have to go</p>\n<p>into the forest.</p>\n<p>Be on your guard against the Wolf.</p>\n<p>If he come in, he</p>\n<p>will devour you all--skin, hair, and all.</p>\n<p>The wretch often disguises</p>\n",
        "<p>himself; but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black</p>\n<p>feet.”</p>\n<p>The Kids said, “Dear Mother, we will take good care of ourselves.</p>\n<p>You</p>\n<p>may go away without any anxiety.”</p>\n<p>Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.</p>\n<p>It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door, and cried,</p>\n",
        "<p>“Open the door, dear Children!</p>\n<p>Your mother is here, and has brought</p>\n<p>something back with her for each of you.”</p>\n<p>But the little Kids knew that it was the Wolf, by his rough voice.</p>\n<p>“We</p>\n<p>will not open the door,” cried they; “you are not our mother.</p>\n<p>She has</p>\n",
        "<p>a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough.</p>\n<p>You are the Wolf!”</p>\n<p>Then the Wolf went away to a shopkeeper, and bought a great lump of</p>\n<p>chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it.</p>\n<p>Then he came back,</p>\n<p>knocked at the door of the house, and cried, “Open the door, dear</p>\n<p>Children!</p>\n",
        "<p>Your mother is here and has brought something back with her</p>\n<p>for each of you.”</p>\n<p>But the Wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the</p>\n<p>children saw them, and cried, “We will not open the door, our mother</p>\n<p>has not black feet like you.</p>\n<p>You are the Wolf!”</p>\n<p>Then the Wolf ran to a baker, and said, “I have hurt my feet, rub some</p>\n",
        "<p>dough over them for me.”</p>\n<p>And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and</p>\n<p>said, “Strew some white meal over my feet for me.” The miller thought</p>\n<p>to himself, “The Wolf wants to deceive some one,” and refused.</p>\n<p>But the</p>\n<p>Wolf said, “If you will not do it, I will devour you.” Then the miller</p>\n<p>was afraid, and made his paws white for him.</p>\n",
        "<p>Yes!</p>\n<p>so are men!</p>\n<p>Now, the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at</p>\n<p>it, and said, “Open the door for me, Children!</p>\n<p>Your dear little mother</p>\n<p>has come home, and has brought every one of you something from the</p>\n<p>forest with her.”</p>\n",

        "<p>She called</p>\n<p>them one after another by name, but no one answered.</p>\n<p>At last, when she</p>\n<p>called the youngest, a soft voice cried, “Dear Mother, I am in the</p>\n<p>clock-case.”</p>\n<p>She took the Kid out, and it told her that the Wolf had come and had</p>\n<p>eaten all the others.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor</p>\n<p>children!</p>\n<p>At length, in her grief she went out, and the youngest Kid ran with</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>When they came to the meadow, there lay the Wolf by the tree and</p>\n<p>he was snoring so loud that the branches shook.</p>\n<p>She looked at him on</p>\n",

        "<p>The mother, however, said, “Now go and</p>\n<p>look for some big stones.</p>\n<p>We will fill the wicked beast’s stomach with</p>\n<p>them, while he is asleep.”</p>\n<p>Then the seven Kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put</p>\n<p>as many of them into his stomach as they could get in.</p>\n<p>And the mother</p>\n",
        "<p>sewed him up again in the greatest haste; so that he was not aware of</p>\n<p>anything and never once stirred.</p>\n<p>When the Wolf had had his sleep out, he got on his legs, and as the</p>\n<p>stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well</p>\n<p>to drink.</p>\n<p>But when he began to walk and to move about, the stones in</p>\n<p>his stomach knocked against each other and rattled.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then cried he:</p>\n<p>“_What rumbles and tumbles</p>\n<p>Against my poor bones?</p>\n<p>I thought ’twas six Kids,</p>\n<p>But it’s only big stones!_”</p>\n<p>And when he got to the well and stooped over the water and was just</p>\n<p>about to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in.</p>\n",

        "<h3>RAPUNZEL</h3>\n<p>There was once a man and a woman, who had long in vain wished for a</p>\n<p>child.</p>\n<p>At length, the woman hoped that God was about to grant her</p>\n<p>desire.</p>\n<p>These people had a little window at the back of their house from which</p>\n<p>a splendid garden could be seen.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was full of the most beautiful</p>\n<p>flowers and herbs.</p>\n<p>It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no</p>\n<p>one dared to go into it because it belonged to a Witch, who had great</p>\n<p>power and was dreaded by all the world.</p>\n<p>One day, the woman was standing by this window and looking down</p>\n<p>into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most</p>\n",
        "<p>beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she</p>\n<p>longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.</p>\n<p>This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get</p>\n<p>any of it, she quite pined away, and looked pale and miserable.</p>\n<p>Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, “What ails you, dear Wife?”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” she replied, “if I can’t get some of the rampion to eat, which is</p>\n<p>in the garden behind our house, I shall die.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The man, who loved her, thought, “Sooner than let your wife die, bring</p>\n<p>her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost you what it will!”</p>\n<p>In the twilight of evening, he clambered over the wall into the garden</p>\n<p>of the Witch, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to</p>\n<p>his wife.</p>\n<p>She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it with much</p>\n<p>relish.</p>\n",
        "<p>She, however, liked it so much--so very much--that the next day she</p>\n<p>longed for it three times as much as before.</p>\n<p>If he was to have any</p>\n<p>rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.</p>\n<p>In the gloom</p>\n<p>of evening, therefore, he let himself down again.</p>\n<p>But when he had</p>\n",
        "<p>clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the Witch</p>\n<p>standing before him.</p>\n<p>“How dare you,” said she with angry look, “descend into my garden and</p>\n<p>steal my rampion like a thief?</p>\n<p>You shall suffer for it!”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” answered he, “let mercy take the place of justice!</p>\n<p>I had to do it</p>\n",
        "<p>out of necessity.</p>\n<p>My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt</p>\n<p>such a longing for it that she would have died, if she had not got some</p>\n<p>to eat.”</p>\n<p>Then the Witch let her anger be softened, and said to him, “If the case</p>\n<p>be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion</p>\n<p>as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child</p>\n",
        "<p>which your wife will bring into the world.</p>\n<p>It shall be well treated,</p>\n<p>and I will care for it like a mother.”</p>\n<p>The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman at</p>\n<p>last had a little daughter, the Witch appeared at once, gave the child</p>\n<p>the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.</p>\n<p>Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun.</p>\n",
        "<p>When she</p>\n<p>was twelve years old, the Witch shut her into a tower, which lay in</p>\n<p>a forest, and had neither stairs nor door.</p>\n<p>But quite at the top was</p>\n<p>a little window.</p>\n<p>When the Witch wanted to go in, she placed herself</p>\n<p>beneath this, and cried:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>\n<p>Let down thy hair._”</p>\n<p>Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she</p>\n<p>heard the voice of the Witch, she unfastened her braided tresses and</p>\n<p>wound them round one of the hooks of the window above.</p>\n<p>And then the</p>\n<p>hair fell twenty ells down, and the Witch climbed up by it.</p>\n",
        "<p>After a year or two, it came to pass that the King’s Son rode through</p>\n<p>the forest and went by the tower.</p>\n<p>Then he heard a song, which was so</p>\n<p>charming that he stood still and listened.</p>\n<p>This was Rapunzel, who in</p>\n<p>her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.</p>\n<p>The King’s Son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of</p>\n",
        "<p>the tower, but none was to be found.</p>\n<p>He rode home, but the singing had</p>\n<p>so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest</p>\n<p>and listened to it.</p>\n<p>Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that a Witch came</p>\n<p>there, and he heard how she cried:</p>\n<p>“_Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>\n",
        "<p>Let down thy hair._”</p>\n<p>Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the Witch climbed up</p>\n<p>to her.</p>\n<p>“If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will for once try my</p>\n<p>fortune,” said he.</p>\n<p>The next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried:</p>\n<p>“_Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>\n",
        "<p>Let down thy hair._”</p>\n<p>Immediately the hair fell down, and the King’s Son climbed up.</p>\n<p>At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes</p>\n<p>had never yet beheld, came to her.</p>\n<p>But the King’s Son began to talk</p>\n<p>to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so</p>\n<p>stirred, that it had let him have no rest, so he had been forced to see</p>\n",
        "<p>her.</p>\n<p>Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take</p>\n<p>him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she</p>\n<p>thought, “He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does;” and she said</p>\n<p>yes, and laid her hand in his.</p>\n<p>She said also, “I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know</p>\n<p>how to get down.</p>\n",
        "<p>Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you</p>\n<p>come, and I will weave a ladder with it.</p>\n<p>When that is ready I will</p>\n<p>descend, and you will take me on your horse.”</p>\n<p>They agreed that until that time, he should come to her every evening,</p>\n<p>for the old woman came by day.</p>\n<p>The Witch remarked nothing of this,</p>\n",
        "<p>until once Rapunzel said to her, “Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens</p>\n<p>that you are so much heavier for me to draw up, than the young King’s</p>\n<p>Son--he is with me in a moment.”</p>\n<p>“Ah!</p>\n<p>you wicked Child!” cried the Witch.</p>\n<p>“What do I hear you say!</p>\n<p>I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have</p>\n",
        "<p>deceived me!”</p>\n<p>In her anger she clutched Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them</p>\n<p>twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right,</p>\n<p>and _snip, snap,_ they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the</p>\n<p>ground.</p>\n<p>And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a</p>\n<p>desert, where she had to live in great grief and misery.</p>\n",
        "<p>On the same day, however, that she cast out Rapunzel, the Witch, in the</p>\n<p>evening, fastened the braids of hair which she had cut off, to the hook</p>\n<p>of the window; and when the King’s Son came and cried:</p>\n<p>“_Rapunzel, Rapunzel,</p>\n<p>Let down thy hair,_”</p>\n<p>she let the hair down.</p>\n<p>The King’s Son ascended.</p>\n",
        "<p>He did not find his dearest Rapunzel above,</p>\n<p>but the Witch, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.</p>\n<p>“Aha!” she cried mockingly, “you would fetch your dearest!</p>\n<p>But the</p>\n<p>beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest.</p>\n<p>The cat has got it,</p>\n<p>and will scratch out your eyes as well.</p>\n",
        "<p>Rapunzel is lost to you!</p>\n<p>You</p>\n<p>will never see her more!”</p>\n<p>The King’s Son was beside himself with grief and in his despair he</p>\n<p>leapt down from the tower.</p>\n<p>He escaped with his life, but the thorns</p>\n<p>into which he fell, pierced his eyes.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he wandered quite blind</p>\n<p>about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did nothing</p>\n<p>but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.</p>\n<p>Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to</p>\n<p>the desert where Rapunzel lived in wretchedness.</p>\n<p>He heard a voice,</p>\n<p>and it seemed so familiar to him that he went toward it.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he</p>\n<p>approached, Rapunzel knew him, and fell on his neck and wept.</p>\n<p>Two of</p>\n<p>her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see</p>\n<p>with them as before.</p>\n<p>He led her to his Kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they</p>\n<p>lived for a long time, happy and contented.</p>\n",

        "<p>lips, he lay there a young Roe.</p>\n<p>And now the little sister wept over her poor bewitched little brother,</p>\n<p>and the little Roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her.</p>\n<p>But at</p>\n<p>last the girl said, “Be quiet, dear little Roe, I will never, never</p>\n<p>leave you.”</p>\n<p>Then she untied her golden garter and put it round the Roe’s neck, and</p>\n",
        "<p>she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord.</p>\n<p>With this she tied</p>\n<p>the little animal and led it on; and she walked deeper and deeper into</p>\n<p>the forest.</p>\n<p>And when they had gone a very long way, they came to a little house.</p>\n<p>The girl looked in; and as it was empty, she thought, “We can stay here</p>\n<p>and live.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then she sought for leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the Roe.</p>\n<p>Every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for</p>\n<p>herself, and brought tender grass for the Roe, who ate out of her hand,</p>\n<p>and was content and played round about her.</p>\n<p>In the evening, when the</p>\n<p>little sister was tired, and had said her prayer, she laid her head</p>\n<p>upon the Roe’s back: that was her pillow, and she slept softly on it.</p>\n",
        "<p>And if only the little brother had had his human form, it would have</p>\n<p>been a delightful life.</p>\n<p>For some time, they were alone like this in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>But it</p>\n<p>happened that the King of the country held a great hunt in the forest.</p>\n<p>Then the blasts of the horns, the barking of dogs, and the merry shouts</p>\n<p>of the huntsmen rang through the trees, and the Roe heard all, and was</p>\n",
        "<p>only too anxious to be there.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said he to his little sister, “let me be off to the hunt, I</p>\n<p>cannot bear it any longer;” and he begged so much that at last she</p>\n<p>agreed.</p>\n<p>“But,” said she to him, “come back to me in the evening.</p>\n<p>I must shut</p>\n<p>my door for fear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, ‘My little</p>\n",
        "<p>Sister, let me in!’ that I may know you.</p>\n<p>And if you do not say that, I</p>\n<p>shall not open the door.”</p>\n<p>Then the young Roe sprang away; so happy was he and so merry in the</p>\n<p>open air.</p>\n<p>The King and the huntsmen saw the pretty creature, and started after</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n",
        "<p>But they could not catch him, and when they thought that they</p>\n<p>surely had him, away he sprang through the bushes and was gone.</p>\n<p>When it was dark he ran to the cottage, knocked, and said, “My little</p>\n<p>Sister, let me in.” Then the door was opened for him, and he jumped in,</p>\n<p>and rested himself the whole night through upon his soft bed.</p>\n<p>The next day, the hunt went on afresh, and when the Roe again heard the</p>\n<p>bugle-horn, and the _ho!</p>\n",
        "<p>ho!_ of the huntsmen, he had no peace, but</p>\n<p>said, “Sister, let me out, I must be off.”</p>\n<p>His sister opened the door for him, and said, “But you must be here</p>\n<p>again in the evening and say your password.”</p>\n<p>When the King and his huntsmen again saw the young Roe with the golden</p>\n<p>collar, they all chased him, but he was too quick and nimble for</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n",
        "<p>This went on for the whole day, but by evening the huntsmen had</p>\n<p>surrounded him, and one of them wounded him a little in the foot, so</p>\n<p>that he limped and ran slowly.</p>\n<p>Then a hunter crept after him to the</p>\n<p>cottage and heard how he said, “My little Sister, let me in,” and saw</p>\n<p>that the door was opened for him, and was shut again at once.</p>\n<p>The huntsman took notice of it all, and went to the King and told him</p>\n",
        "<p>what he had seen and heard.</p>\n<p>Then the King said, “To-morrow we will hunt</p>\n<p>once more.”</p>\n<p>The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that</p>\n<p>her little Roe was hurt.</p>\n<p>She washed the blood off him, laid herbs on</p>\n<p>the wound, and said, “Go to your bed, dear Roe, that you may get well</p>\n",
        "<p>again.”</p>\n<p>But the wound was so slight that the Roe, next morning, did not feel it</p>\n<p>any more.</p>\n<p>And when he again heard the sport outside, he said, “I cannot</p>\n<p>bear it, I must be there.</p>\n<p>They shall not find it so easy to catch me!”</p>\n<p>The little sister cried, and said, “This time they will kill you, and</p>\n",
        "<p>here am I alone in the forest, and forsaken by all the world.</p>\n<p>I will</p>\n<p>not let you out.”</p>\n<p>“Then you will have me die of grief,” answered the Roe.</p>\n<p>“When I hear</p>\n<p>the bugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin.”</p>\n<p>Then the little sister could not do otherwise, but opened the door for</p>\n",
        "<p>him with a heavy heart, and the Roe, full of health and joy, bounded</p>\n<p>away into the forest.</p>\n<p>When the King saw him, he said to his huntsman, “Now chase him all day</p>\n<p>long till nightfall, but take care that no one does him any harm.”</p>\n<p>As soon as the sun had set, the King said to the huntsmen, “Now come</p>\n<p>and show me the cottage in the wood;” and when he was at the door,</p>\n<p>he knocked and called out, “Dear little Sister, let me in.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the door opened, and the King walked in, and there stood a maiden</p>\n<p>more lovely than any he had ever seen.</p>\n<p>The maiden was frightened when</p>\n<p>she saw, not her little Roe, but a man with a golden crown upon his</p>\n<p>head.</p>\n<p>But the King looked kindly at her, stretched out his hand, and</p>\n<p>said:</p>\n",
        "<p>“Will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife?”</p>\n<p>[Illustration: THE KING SAID, “WILL YOU BE MY DEAR WIFE?”]</p>\n<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered the maiden, “but the little Roe must go with</p>\n<p>me.</p>\n<p>I cannot leave him.”</p>\n<p>The King said, “He shall stay with you as long as you live, and shall</p>\n<p>want nothing.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Just then he came running in, and the little sister again tied him with</p>\n<p>the cord of rushes, took it in her own hand, and went away with the</p>\n<p>King from the cottage.</p>\n<p>The King took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried her to his</p>\n<p>palace, where the wedding was held with great pomp.</p>\n<p>She was now the</p>\n<p>Queen, and they lived for a long time happily together.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Roe was</p>\n<p>tended and cherished, and ran about in the palace-garden.</p>\n<p>But the wicked Witch, because of whom the children had gone out into</p>\n<p>the world, thought all the time that the little sister had been torn to</p>\n<p>pieces by the wild beasts in the wood, and that the little brother had</p>\n<p>been shot for a Roe by the huntsmen.</p>\n<p>Now when she heard that they were</p>\n",
        "<p>so happy, and so well off, envy and hatred rose in her heart and left</p>\n<p>her no peace, and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them</p>\n<p>again to misfortune.</p>\n<p>Her own daughter, who was as ugly as night, and had only one eye,</p>\n<p>grumbled at her and said, “A Queen!</p>\n<p>that ought to have been my luck.”</p>\n<p>“Only be quiet,” answered the old woman, and comforted her by saying,</p>\n",
        "<p>“when the time comes I shall be ready.”</p>\n<p>As time went on, the Queen had a pretty little boy.</p>\n<p>It happened that</p>\n<p>the King was out hunting; so the old Witch took the form of the</p>\n<p>chambermaid, went into the room where the Queen lay, and said to her,</p>\n<p>“Come, the bath is ready.</p>\n<p>It will do you good, and give you fresh</p>\n",
        "<p>strength.</p>\n<p>Make haste before it gets cold.”</p>\n<p>The daughter also was close by; so they carried the weak Queen into the</p>\n<p>bathroom, and put her into the bath.</p>\n<p>Then they shut the door and ran</p>\n<p>away.</p>\n<p>But in the bathroom they had made a fire of such deadly heat,</p>\n",
        "<p>that the beautiful young Queen was soon suffocated.</p>\n<p>When this was done, the old woman took her daughter, put a nightcap on</p>\n<p>her head, and laid her in bed in place of the Queen.</p>\n<p>She gave her too</p>\n<p>the shape and the look of the Queen, only she could not make good the</p>\n<p>lost eye.</p>\n<p>But, in order that the King might not see it, she was to lie</p>\n",
        "<p>on the side on which she had no eye.</p>\n<p>In the evening, when he came home and heard that he had a son, he was</p>\n<p>heartily glad, and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she</p>\n<p>was.</p>\n<p>But the old woman quickly called out, “For your life leave the</p>\n<p>curtains closed.</p>\n<p>The Queen ought not to see the light yet, and must</p>\n",
        "<p>have rest.”</p>\n<p>The King went away, and did not find out that a false Queen was lying</p>\n<p>in the bed.</p>\n<p>But at midnight, when all slept, the nurse, who was sitting in the</p>\n<p>nursery by the cradle, and who was the only person awake, saw the door</p>\n<p>open and the true Queen walk in.</p>\n<p>She took the child out of the cradle,</p>\n",
        "<p>laid it on her arm and nursed it.</p>\n<p>Then she shook up its pillow, laid</p>\n<p>the child down again, and covered it with the little quilt.</p>\n<p>And she did</p>\n<p>not forget the Roe, but went into the corner where he lay, and stroked</p>\n<p>his back.</p>\n<p>Then she went quite silently out of the door again.</p>\n",
        "<p>The next morning, the nurse asked the guards whether any one had come</p>\n<p>into the palace during the night, but they answered, “No, we have seen</p>\n<p>no one.”</p>\n<p>She came thus many nights and never spoke a word.</p>\n<p>The nurse always saw</p>\n<p>her, but she did not dare to tell any one about it.</p>\n<p>When some time had passed in this manner, the Queen began to speak in</p>\n",
        "<p>the night, and said:</p>\n<p>“_How fares my child, how fares my Roe?</p>\n<p>Twice shall I come, then never moe!_”</p>\n<p>The nurse did not answer, but when the Queen had gone again, went to</p>\n<p>the King and told him all.</p>\n<p>The King said, “Ah, heavens!</p>\n<p>what is this?</p>\n",
        "<p>To-morrow night I will watch</p>\n<p>by the child.”</p>\n<p>In the evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the Queen</p>\n<p>again appeared, and said:</p>\n<p>“_How fares my child, how fares my Roe?</p>\n<p>Once shall I come, then never moe!_”</p>\n<p>And she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared.</p>\n",
        "<p>The King dared not speak to her, but on the next night he watched</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>Then she said:</p>\n<p>“_How fares my child, How fares my Roe?</p>\n<p>This time I come, then never moe!_”</p>\n<p>At that the King could not restrain himself.</p>\n<p>He sprang toward her, and</p>\n",
        "<p>said, “You can be none other than my dear wife.”</p>\n<p>She answered, “Yes, I am your dear wife,” and at the same moment she</p>\n<p>received life again, and by God’s grace became fresh, rosy, and full of</p>\n<p>health.</p>\n<p>Then she told the King the evil deed which the wicked Witch and her</p>\n<p>daughter had been guilty of toward her.</p>\n<p>The King ordered both to be led</p>\n",
        "<p>before the judge, and judgment was delivered against them.</p>\n<p>The daughter</p>\n<p>was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts,</p>\n<p>but the Witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt.</p>\n<p>And as soon as she was burnt the Roe changed his shape, and received</p>\n<p>his human form again.</p>\n<p>So the little sister and little brother lived</p>\n",
        "<p>happily together all their lives.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE STAR-MONEY</h3>\n<p>There was once on a time, a little girl whose father and mother were</p>\n<p>dead.</p>\n<p>She was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live</p>\n<p>in, or bed to sleep in.</p>\n",
        "<p>At last, she had nothing else but the clothes</p>\n<p>she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some</p>\n<p>charitable soul had given her.</p>\n<p>She was, however, good and pious.</p>\n<p>And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the</p>\n<p>open country, trusting in the good God.</p>\n<p>Then a poor man met her, who said, “Ah, give me something to eat, I am</p>\n",
        "<p>so hungry!”</p>\n<p>She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said, “May God</p>\n<p>bless it to your use,” and went onward.</p>\n<p>Then came a child who moaned and said, “My head is so cold, give me</p>\n<p>something to cover it with.”</p>\n<p>So she took off her hood and gave it to him.</p>\n<p>And when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had</p>\n",
        "<p>no jacket and was frozen with cold.</p>\n<p>Then she gave it her own.</p>\n<p>A little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also.</p>\n<p>At length, she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and</p>\n<p>there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt.</p>\n<p>The good</p>\n<p>little girl thought to herself, “It is a dark night and no one sees me.</p>\n",
        "<p>I can very well give my little shirt away,” and took it off, and gave</p>\n<p>away that also.</p>\n<p>And she so stood, and had not one single thing left.</p>\n<p>Then suddenly some</p>\n<p>Stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth</p>\n<p>pieces of money!</p>\n<p>And although she had just given her little shirt away,</p>\n",
        "<p>lo!</p>\n<p>she had a new one which was of the very finest linen.</p>\n<p>Then she gathered together the money into this, and was rich all the</p>\n<p>days of her life.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE</h3>\n<p>There was once on a time, a Fisherman who lived with his wife in a</p>\n",
        "<p>miserable hovel close by the sea, and every day he went out fishing.</p>\n<p>And once, as he was sitting with his rod, looking at the clear water,</p>\n<p>his line suddenly went down, far down below, and when he drew it up</p>\n<p>again, he brought out a large Flounder.</p>\n<p>Then the Flounder said to him: “Hark, you Fisherman, I pray you, let me</p>\n<p>live.</p>\n<p>I am no Flounder really, but an enchanted Prince.</p>\n",
        "<p>What good will</p>\n<p>it do you to kill me?</p>\n<p>I should not be good to eat.</p>\n<p>Put me in the water</p>\n<p>again, and let me go.”</p>\n<p>“Come,” said the Fisherman, “there is no need for so many words about</p>\n<p>it--a fish that can talk I should certainly let go, anyhow.”</p>\n",
        "<p>With that he put him back again into the clear water, and the Flounder</p>\n<p>went to the bottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him.</p>\n<p>Then the</p>\n<p>Fisherman got up and went home to his wife in the hovel.</p>\n<p>“Husband,” said the woman, “have you caught nothing to-day?”</p>\n<p>“No,” said the man, “I did catch a Flounder, who said he was an</p>\n<p>enchanted Prince, so I let him go again.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Did you not wish for anything first?” said the woman.</p>\n<p>“No,” said the man; “what should I wish for?”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said the woman, “it is surely hard to have to live always in</p>\n<p>this dirty hovel.</p>\n<p>You might have wished for a small cottage for us.</p>\n<p>Go</p>\n<p>back and call him.</p>\n",
        "<p>Tell him we want to have a small cottage.</p>\n<p>He will</p>\n<p>certainly give us that.”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said the man, “why should I go there again?”</p>\n<p>“Why,” said the woman, “you did catch him, and you let him go again.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>is sure to do it.</p>\n",
        "<p>Go at once.”</p>\n<p>The man still did not quite like to go, but did not want to oppose his</p>\n<p>wife, and went to the sea.</p>\n<p>When he got there the sea was all green and yellow, and no longer</p>\n<p>smooth.</p>\n<p>So he stood and said:</p>\n<p>“_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,</p>\n",
        "<p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>\n<p>For my wife, Dame Ilsabil,</p>\n<p>Wills not as I’d have her will._”</p>\n<p>Then the Flounder came swimming to him and said, “Well, what does she</p>\n<p>want, then?”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said the man, “I did catch you, and my wife says I really ought</p>\n<p>to have wished for something.</p>\n",
        "<p>She does not like to live in a wretched</p>\n<p>hovel any longer.</p>\n<p>She would like to have a cottage.”</p>\n<p>“Go, then,” said the Flounder, “she has it already.”</p>\n<p>When the man got home, his wife was no longer in the hovel.</p>\n<p>But instead</p>\n<p>of it, there stood a small cottage, and she was sitting on a bench</p>\n",
        "<p>before the door.</p>\n<p>Then she took him by the hand and said to him, “Just</p>\n<p>come inside, look.</p>\n<p>Now isn’t this a great deal better?”</p>\n<p>So they went in, and there was a small porch, and a pretty little</p>\n<p>parlor and bedroom, and a kitchen and pantry, with the best of</p>\n<p>furniture, and fitted up with the most beautiful things made of tin and</p>\n",
        "<p>brass, whatsoever was wanted.</p>\n<p>And behind the cottage, there was a small</p>\n<p>yard, with hens and ducks, and a little garden with flowers and fruit.</p>\n<p>“Look,” said the wife, “is not that nice!”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the husband, “and so we must always think it,--now we will</p>\n<p>live quite contented.”</p>\n<p>“We will think about that,” said the wife.</p>\n",
        "<p>With that they ate something and went to bed.</p>\n<p>Everything went well for a week or a fortnight, and then the woman</p>\n<p>said, “Hark you, Husband, this cottage is far too small for us, and the</p>\n<p>garden and yard are little.</p>\n<p>The Flounder might just as well have given</p>\n<p>us a larger house.</p>\n<p>I should like to live in a great stone castle.</p>\n",
        "<p>Go to</p>\n<p>the Flounder, and tell him to give us a castle.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, Wife,” said the man, “the cottage is quite good enough.</p>\n<p>Why should</p>\n<p>we live in a castle?”</p>\n<p>“What!” said the woman; “go at once, the Flounder can always do that.”</p>\n<p>“No, Wife,” said the man, “the Flounder has just given us the cottage.</p>\n",
        "<p>I do not like to go back so soon, it might make him angry.”</p>\n<p>“Go,” said the woman, “he can do it quite easily, and will be glad to</p>\n<p>do it.</p>\n<p>Just you go to him.”</p>\n<p>The man’s heart grew heavy, and he did not wish to go.</p>\n<p>He said to</p>\n<p>himself, “It is not right,” and yet he went.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when he came to the sea, the water was quite purple and dark-blue,</p>\n<p>and gray and thick, and no longer green and yellow, but it was still</p>\n<p>quiet.</p>\n<p>And he stood there and said:</p>\n<p>“_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,</p>\n<p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>\n<p>For my wife, Dame Ilsabil,</p>\n",
        "<p>Wills not as I’d have her will._”</p>\n<p>“Well, what does she want, now?” said the Flounder.</p>\n<p>“Alas,” said the man, half scared, “she wants to live in a great stone</p>\n<p>castle.”</p>\n<p>“Go to it, then, she is standing before the door,” said the Flounder.</p>\n<p>Then the man went home, and when he got there, he found a great stone</p>\n<p>palace, and his wife was just standing on the steps going in.</p>\n",
        "<p>She took</p>\n<p>him by the hand and said, “Come in.”</p>\n<p>So he went with her, and in the castle was a great hall paved with</p>\n<p>marble, and many servants, who flung wide the doors.</p>\n<p>The walls were all</p>\n<p>bright with beautiful hangings, and in the rooms were chairs and tables</p>\n<p>of pure gold.</p>\n",
        "<p>Crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling, and all the</p>\n<p>rooms and bedrooms had carpets.</p>\n<p>Food and wine of the very best were</p>\n<p>standing on all the tables, so that they nearly broke down beneath it.</p>\n<p>Behind the house, too, there was a great courtyard, with stables</p>\n<p>for horses and cows, and the very best of carriages.</p>\n<p>There was a</p>\n",
        "<p>magnificent large garden, too, with the most beautiful flowers and</p>\n<p>fruit-trees, and a park quite half a mile long, in which were stags,</p>\n<p>deer, and hares, and everything that could be desired.</p>\n<p>“Come,” said the woman, “isn’t that beautiful?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, indeed,” said the man, “now let it be; and we will live in this</p>\n<p>beautiful castle and be content.”</p>\n<p>“We will consider about that,” said the woman, “and sleep upon it;”</p>\n",
        "<p>thereupon they went to bed.</p>\n<p>Next morning, the wife awoke first.</p>\n<p>It was just daybreak, and from her</p>\n<p>bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her.</p>\n<p>Her husband was</p>\n<p>still stretching himself, so she poked him in the side with her elbow,</p>\n<p>and said, “Get up, Husband, and just peep out of the window.</p>\n",
        "<p>Look you,</p>\n<p>couldn’t we be the King over all that land?</p>\n<p>Go to the Flounder, we will</p>\n<p>be the King.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, Wife,” said the man, “why should we be King?</p>\n<p>I do not want to be</p>\n<p>King.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well,” said the wife, “if you won’t be King, I will.</p>\n<p>Go to the</p>\n<p>Flounder, for I will be King.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, Wife,” said the man, “why do you want to be King?</p>\n<p>I do not like to</p>\n<p>say that to him.”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” said the woman; “go to him at once.</p>\n",
        "<p>I must be King!”</p>\n<p>So the man went, and was quite unhappy because his wife wished to be</p>\n<p>King.</p>\n<p>“It is not right; it is not right,” thought he.</p>\n<p>He did not wish</p>\n<p>to go, but yet he went.</p>\n<p>And when he came to the sea, it was quite dark-gray, and the water</p>\n",

        "<p>“Well, what does she want, now?” said the Flounder.</p>\n<p>“Alas,” said the man, “she wants to be King.”</p>\n<p>“Go to her; she is King already.”</p>\n<p>So the man went, and when he came to the palace, the castle had</p>\n<p>become much larger, and had a great tower and magnificent ornaments.</p>\n<p>The sentinel was standing before the door, and there were numbers of</p>\n<p>soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when he went inside the</p>\n<p>house, everything was of real marble and gold, with velvet covers and</p>\n<p>great golden tassels.</p>\n<p>Then the doors of the hall were opened, and there</p>\n<p>was the Court in all its splendor, and his wife was sitting on a high</p>\n<p>throne of gold and diamonds, with a great crown of gold on her head,</p>\n<p>and a sceptre of pure gold and jewels in her hand.</p>\n",
        "<p>On both sides of</p>\n<p>her, stood her maids-in-waiting in a row, each of them always one head</p>\n<p>shorter than the last.</p>\n<p>Then he went and stood before her, and said, “Ah, Wife, and now you are</p>\n<p>King.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the woman, “now I am King.”</p>\n<p>So he stood and looked at her, and when he had looked at her thus for</p>\n",
        "<p>some time, he said, “And now that you are King, let all else be, we</p>\n<p>will wish for nothing more.”</p>\n<p>“Nay, Husband,” said the woman, quite anxiously, “I find time pass</p>\n<p>very heavily, I can bear it no longer.</p>\n<p>Go to the Flounder--I am King,</p>\n<p>but I must be Emperor, too.”</p>\n<p>“Alas, Wife, why do you wish to be Emperor?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Husband,” said she, “go to the Flounder.</p>\n<p>I will be Emperor.”</p>\n<p>“Alas, Wife,” said the man, “he cannot make you Emperor.</p>\n<p>I may not say</p>\n<p>that to the fish.</p>\n<p>There is only one Emperor in the land.</p>\n<p>An Emperor,</p>\n",
        "<p>the Flounder cannot make you!</p>\n<p>I assure you he cannot.”</p>\n<p>“What!” said the woman, “I am the King, and you are nothing but my</p>\n<p>husband.</p>\n<p>Will you go this moment?</p>\n<p>go at once!</p>\n<p>If he can make a King, he</p>\n",
        "<p>can make an Emperor.</p>\n<p>I will be Emperor.</p>\n<p>Go instantly.”</p>\n<p>So he was forced to go.</p>\n<p>As the man went, however, he was troubled in</p>\n<p>mind, and thought to himself, “It will not end well!</p>\n<p>It will not end</p>\n",
        "<p>well!</p>\n<p>Emperor is too shameless!</p>\n<p>The Flounder will at last be tired out.”</p>\n<p>With that, he reached the sea, and the sea was quite black and thick,</p>\n<p>and began to boil up from below, so that it threw up bubbles.</p>\n<p>And such</p>\n<p>a sharp wind blew over it that it curdled, and the man was afraid.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then</p>\n<p>he went and stood by it, and said:</p>\n<p>“_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,</p>\n<p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>\n<p>For my wife, Dame Ilsabil,</p>\n<p>Wills not as I’d have her will._”</p>\n<p>“Well, what does she want, now?” said the Flounder.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Alas, Flounder,” said he, “my wife wants to be Emperor.”</p>\n<p>“Go to her,” said the Flounder; “she is Emperor already.”</p>\n<p>So the man went, and when he got there the whole palace was made of</p>\n<p>polished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets, and beating</p>\n<p>cymbals and drums.</p>\n",
        "<p>In the house, barons, and counts, and dukes were</p>\n<p>going about as servants.</p>\n<p>Then they opened the doors to him, which were</p>\n<p>of pure gold.</p>\n<p>And when he entered, there sat his wife on a throne,</p>\n<p>which was made of one piece of gold, and was quite two miles high;</p>\n<p>and she wore a great golden crown that was three yards high, and set</p>\n",
        "<p>with diamonds and carbuncles.</p>\n<p>In one hand she had the sceptre, and in</p>\n<p>the other the imperial orb.</p>\n<p>And on both sides of her stood the yeomen</p>\n<p>of the guard in two rows, each being smaller than the one before him,</p>\n<p>from the biggest Giant, who was two miles high, to the very smallest</p>\n<p>Dwarf, just as big as my little finger.</p>\n",
        "<p>And before it stood a number of</p>\n<p>princes and dukes.</p>\n<p>Then the man went and stood among than, and said, “Wife, are you</p>\n<p>Emperor now?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said she, “now I am Emperor.”</p>\n<p>Then he stood and looked at her well, and when he had looked at her</p>\n<p>thus for some time, he said, “Ah, Wife, be content, now that you are</p>\n",
        "<p>Emperor.”</p>\n<p>“Husband,” said she, “why are you standing there?</p>\n<p>Now, I am Emperor,</p>\n<p>but I will be Pope too.</p>\n<p>Go to the Flounder.”</p>\n<p>“Alas, Wife,” said the man, “what will you not wish for?</p>\n<p>You cannot be</p>\n",
        "<p>Pope.</p>\n<p>There is but one in Christendom.</p>\n<p>He cannot make you Pope.”</p>\n<p>“Husband,” said she, “I will be Pope.</p>\n<p>Go immediately.</p>\n<p>I must be Pope</p>\n<p>this very day.”</p>\n",
        "<p>[Illustration: “YES,” SAID SHE “NOW I AM EMPEROR”]</p>\n<p>“No, Wife,” said the man, “I do not like to say that to him; that would</p>\n<p>not do, it is too much.</p>\n<p>The Flounder can’t make you Pope.”</p>\n<p>“Husband,” said she, “what nonsense!</p>\n<p>if he can make an Emperor he can</p>\n<p>make a Pope.</p>\n",
        "<p>Go to him directly.</p>\n<p>I am Emperor, and you are nothing but</p>\n<p>my husband.</p>\n<p>Will you go at once?”</p>\n<p>Then he was afraid and went.</p>\n<p>But he was quite faint, and shivered and</p>\n<p>shook, and his knees and legs trembled.</p>\n",
        "<p>And a high wind blew over the</p>\n<p>land, and the clouds flew, and toward evening all grew dark, and the</p>\n<p>leaves fell from the trees, and the water rose and roared as if it were</p>\n<p>boiling, and splashed upon the shore.</p>\n<p>In the distance he saw ships</p>\n<p>which were firing guns in their sore need, pitching and tossing on the</p>\n<p>waves.</p>\n",
        "<p>And yet in the midst of the sky, there was still a small bit of</p>\n<p>blue, though on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm.</p>\n<p>So, full</p>\n<p>of despair, he went and stood in much fear, and said:</p>\n<p>“_Flounder, Flounder in the sea,</p>\n<p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>\n<p>For my wife, Dame Ilsabil,</p>\n",

        "<p>Inside, however, everything was lighted with thousands and thousands of</p>\n<p>candles, and his wife was clad in gold, and she was sitting on a much</p>\n<p>higher throne, and had three great golden crowns on, and round about</p>\n<p>her there was much churchly splendor.</p>\n<p>And on both sides of her was a</p>\n<p>row of candles, the largest of which was as tall as the very tallest</p>\n<p>tower, down to the very smallest kitchen candle; and all the emperors</p>\n",
        "<p>and kings were on their knees before her, kissing her shoe.</p>\n<p>“Wife,” said the man, and looked attentively at her, “are you now Pope?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said she, “I am Pope.”</p>\n<p>So he stood and looked at her, and it was just as if he was looking at</p>\n<p>the bright sun.</p>\n<p>When he had stood looking at her thus for a short time,</p>\n<p>he said, “Ah, Wife, if you are Pope, do let well alone!”</p>\n",
        "<p>But she looked as stiff as a post, and did not move or show any signs</p>\n<p>of life.</p>\n<p>Then said he, “Wife, now that you are Pope, be satisfied, you</p>\n<p>cannot become anything greater.”</p>\n<p>“I will consider about that,” said the woman.</p>\n<p>Thereupon they both went to bed.</p>\n<p>But she was not satisfied, and</p>\n",

        "<p>else.</p>\n<p>At length the sun began to rise, and when the woman saw the red of</p>\n<p>dawn, she sat up in bed and looked at it.</p>\n<p>And when, through the window,</p>\n<p>she saw the sun thus rising, she said, “Cannot I, too, order the sun</p>\n<p>and moon to rise?”</p>\n<p>“Husband,” said she, poking him in the ribs with her elbows, “wake up!</p>\n",
        "<p>go to the Flounder, for I wish to be even as God is.”</p>\n<p>The man was still half asleep, but he was so horrified that he fell out</p>\n<p>of bed.</p>\n<p>He thought he must have heard amiss, and rubbed his eyes, and</p>\n<p>said, “Alas, Wife, what are you saying?”</p>\n<p>“Husband,” said she, “if I can’t order the sun and moon to rise, and</p>\n<p>have to look on and see the sun and moon rising, I can’t bear it.</p>\n",
        "<p>I</p>\n<p>shall not know what it is to have another happy hour, unless I can make</p>\n<p>them rise myself.” Then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder</p>\n<p>ran over him, and said, “Go at once.</p>\n<p>I wish to be like unto God.”</p>\n<p>“Alas, Wife,” said the man, falling on his knees before her, “the</p>\n<p>Flounder cannot do that.</p>\n",
        "<p>He can make an Emperor and a Pope.</p>\n<p>I beseech</p>\n<p>you, go on as you are, and be Pope.”</p>\n<p>Then she fell into a rage, and her hair flew wildly about her head, and</p>\n<p>she cried, “I will not endure this, I’ll not bear it any longer.</p>\n<p>Will</p>\n<p>you go?” Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman.</p>\n",
        "<p>But outside a great storm was raging, and blowing so hard that he</p>\n<p>could scarcely keep his feet.</p>\n<p>Houses and trees toppled over, mountains</p>\n<p>trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky was pitch black, and it</p>\n<p>thundered and lightened.</p>\n<p>And the sea came in with black waves as high</p>\n<p>as church-towers and mountains, and all with crests of white foam at</p>\n",

        "<p>“Alas,” said he, “she wants to be like unto God.”</p>\n<p>“Go to her, and you will find her back again in the dirty hovel.”</p>\n<p>And there they are living at this very time.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE WHITE SNAKE</h3>\n<p>A long time ago, there lived a King who was famed for his wisdom</p>\n<p>through all the land.</p>\n",
        "<p>Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if</p>\n<p>news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air.</p>\n<p>But he had a strange custom.</p>\n<p>Every day after dinner, when the table was</p>\n<p>cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him</p>\n<p>one more dish.</p>\n<p>It was covered and even the servant did not know what</p>\n",
        "<p>was in it.</p>\n<p>Neither did any one know, for the King never took off the</p>\n<p>cover to eat of it, until he was quite alone.</p>\n<p>This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took</p>\n<p>away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help</p>\n<p>carrying the dish into his room.</p>\n<p>When he had carefully locked the door,</p>\n",
        "<p>he lifted up the cover, and saw a White Snake lying on the dish.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>when he saw it, he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,</p>\n<p>so he cut off a little bit and put it into his mouth.</p>\n<p>No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering</p>\n<p>of little voices outside his window.</p>\n<p>He went and listened, and then</p>\n",
        "<p>noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and</p>\n<p>telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the</p>\n<p>fields and woods.</p>\n<p>Eating the Snake had given him power to understand</p>\n<p>the language of animals!</p>\n<p>Now, it so happened, that on this very day the Queen lost her most</p>\n<p>beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty</p>\n",
        "<p>servant, who was allowed to go everywhere.</p>\n<p>The King ordered the man to</p>\n<p>be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he</p>\n<p>could, before the morrow, point out the thief, he himself should be</p>\n<p>looked upon as guilty and should be executed.</p>\n<p>In vain, he declared his</p>\n<p>innocence.</p>\n",
        "<p>He was dismissed with no better answer.</p>\n<p>In his trouble and fear, he went down into the courtyard, and took</p>\n<p>thought how to help himself out of his trouble.</p>\n<p>Now some ducks were</p>\n<p>sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest.</p>\n<p>And, whilst</p>\n<p>they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were</p>\n",
        "<p>having a confidential conversation.</p>\n<p>The servant stood by and listened.</p>\n<p>They were telling one another of all the places where they had been</p>\n<p>waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>one said in a pitiful tone, “Something lies heavy on my stomach; as</p>\n<p>I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the Queen’s</p>\n",
        "<p>window.”</p>\n<p>The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen,</p>\n<p>and said to the cook, “Here is a fine duck.</p>\n<p>Pray kill her.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; “she has spared</p>\n<p>no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting long enough to be</p>\n<p>roasted.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So he cut off her head; and as she was being dressed for the spit, the</p>\n<p>Queen’s ring was found inside her.</p>\n<p>The servant could now easily prove his innocence.</p>\n<p>The King, to make</p>\n<p>amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favor, and promised him the</p>\n<p>best place in the Court.</p>\n<p>The servant refused everything, and asked only</p>\n",
        "<p>for a horse and some money for traveling, as he had a mind to see the</p>\n<p>world and go about a little.</p>\n<p>When his request was granted, he set out</p>\n<p>on his way.</p>\n<p>One day he came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the</p>\n<p>reeds and gasping for water.</p>\n<p>Now, though it is said that fishes are</p>\n",
        "<p>dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably.</p>\n<p>As he</p>\n<p>had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back</p>\n<p>into the water.</p>\n<p>They quivered with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him, “We</p>\n<p>will remember you, and repay you for saving us!”</p>\n<p>He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in</p>\n",
        "<p>the sand at his feet.</p>\n<p>He listened, and heard an Ant-King complain, “Why</p>\n<p>cannot folk, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies?</p>\n<p>That stupid</p>\n<p>horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without</p>\n<p>mercy!”</p>\n<p>So he turned on to a side path and the Ant-King cried out to him, “We</p>\n",
        "<p>will remember you---one good turn deserves another!”</p>\n<p>The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing</p>\n<p>by their nest, and throwing out their young ones.</p>\n<p>“Out with you, you</p>\n<p>idle, good-for-nothing creatures!” cried they; “we cannot find food</p>\n<p>for you any longer.</p>\n<p>You are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.”</p>\n",
        "<p>But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground flapping their wings, and</p>\n<p>crying, “Oh, what helpless chicks we are!</p>\n<p>We must shift for ourselves,</p>\n<p>and yet we cannot fly!</p>\n<p>What can we do, but lie here and starve?”</p>\n<p>So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his</p>\n<p>sword, and gave it to them for food.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then they came hopping up to it,</p>\n<p>satisfied their hunger, and cried, “We will remember you--one good turn</p>\n<p>deserves another!”</p>\n<p>And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way,</p>\n<p>he came to a large city.</p>\n<p>There was a great noise and crowd in the</p>\n<p>streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud, “The King’s</p>\n",

        "<p>that he forgot all danger, went before the King, and declared himself a</p>\n<p>suitor.</p>\n<p>So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was cast into it.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>the King ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea,</p>\n<p>and added, “If you come up without it, you will be thrown in again and</p>\n<p>again until you perish amid the waves.”</p>\n",
        "<p>All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away;</p>\n<p>leaving him alone by the sea.</p>\n<p>[Illustration: THERE LAY THE GOLD RING IN THE SHELL]</p>\n<p>He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly</p>\n<p>he saw three fishes come swimming toward him.</p>\n<p>They were the very</p>\n<p>fishes whose lives he had saved.</p>\n",

        "<p>But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said, “Although he</p>\n<p>has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband, until he has</p>\n<p>brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.”</p>\n<p>The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out,</p>\n<p>and would have gone on forever, as long as his legs would carry him,</p>\n<p>though he had no hope of finding it.</p>\n<p>After he had wandered through</p>\n",

        "<p>brightly, and the white pebbles, which lay in front of the house,</p>\n<p>glittered like real silver pennies.</p>\n<p>Haensel stooped and put as many of</p>\n<p>them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in.</p>\n<p>Then he went back and said to Grethel, “Be comforted, dear little</p>\n<p>Sister, and sleep in peace.</p>\n<p>God will not forsake us,” and he lay down</p>\n",
        "<p>again in his bed.</p>\n<p>When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke</p>\n<p>the two children, saying, “Get up, you sluggards!</p>\n<p>we are going into the</p>\n<p>forest to fetch wood.” She gave each a little piece of bread, and said,</p>\n<p>“There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,</p>\n<p>for you will get nothing else.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Grethel took the bread under her apron, as Haensel had the stones in</p>\n<p>his pocket.</p>\n<p>Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.</p>\n<p>When they had walked a short time, Haensel stood still and peeped</p>\n<p>back, and did so again and again while he was throwing the white</p>\n<p>pebble-stones one by one out of his pocket onto the road.</p>\n<p>When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, “Now,</p>\n",
        "<p>Children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not</p>\n<p>be cold.”</p>\n<p>Haensel and Grethel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little</p>\n<p>hill.</p>\n<p>The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very</p>\n<p>high, the woman said, “Now, Children, lay yourselves down by the fire</p>\n<p>and rest.</p>\n",
        "<p>We will go into the forest and cut some wood.</p>\n<p>When we have</p>\n<p>done, we will come back and fetch you away.”</p>\n<p>Haensel and Grethel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a</p>\n<p>little piece of bread; and, as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe,</p>\n<p>they believed that their father was near.</p>\n<p>It was, however, not the axe,</p>\n",
        "<p>it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind</p>\n<p>was blowing backward and forward.</p>\n<p>And as they had been sitting such a</p>\n<p>long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>When at last they awoke, it was already dark night.</p>\n<p>Grethel began to cry</p>\n<p>and said, “How are we to get out of the forest now?”</p>\n",
        "<p>But Haensel comforted her, and said, “Just wait a little, until the</p>\n<p>moon has risen, and then we shall soon find the way.”</p>\n<p>And when the full moon had risen, Haensel took his little sister by the</p>\n<p>hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver</p>\n<p>pieces, and showed them the way.</p>\n<p>They walked the whole night long, and, by break of day, came once more</p>\n<p>to their father’s house.</p>\n",
        "<p>They knocked at the door; and when the woman</p>\n<p>opened it and saw that it was Haensel and Grethel, she said, “You</p>\n<p>naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought</p>\n<p>you were never coming back at all!”</p>\n<p>The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave</p>\n<p>them behind alone.</p>\n<p>Not long afterward, there was another famine in all parts, and</p>\n",
        "<p>the children heard their mother saying at night to their father,</p>\n<p>“Everything is eaten again, we have one-half loaf left, and after that</p>\n<p>there is an end.</p>\n<p>The children must go, we will take them farther into</p>\n<p>the wood, so that they will not find their way out again.</p>\n<p>There is no</p>\n<p>other means of saving ourselves!”</p>\n",
        "<p>The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought “it would be better for you</p>\n<p>to share the last mouthful with your children!” The woman, however,</p>\n<p>would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the</p>\n<p>first time, he had to do so a second time also.</p>\n<p>The children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the old folk were asleep, Haensel again got up to go out and pick</p>\n<p>up pebbles.</p>\n<p>But the woman had locked the door, and Haensel could not</p>\n<p>get out.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, “Do not</p>\n<p>cry, Grethel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.”</p>\n<p>Early in the morning, came the woman, and took the children out of</p>\n",
        "<p>their beds.</p>\n<p>Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still</p>\n<p>smaller than the time before.</p>\n<p>On the way into the forest, Haensel</p>\n<p>crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on</p>\n<p>the ground, and little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.</p>\n<p>The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had</p>\n",
        "<p>never in their lives been before.</p>\n<p>Then a great fire was again made, and</p>\n<p>the mother said, “Just sit there, you Children, and when you are tired</p>\n<p>you may sleep a little.</p>\n<p>We are going into the forest to cut wood.</p>\n<p>In</p>\n<p>the evening, when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.”</p>\n",
        "<p>When it was noon, Grethel shared her piece of bread with Haensel,</p>\n<p>who had scattered his by the way.</p>\n<p>Then they fell asleep, and evening</p>\n<p>passed, but no one came to the poor children.</p>\n<p>They did not awake until it was dark night, and Haensel comforted his</p>\n<p>little sister and said, “Just wait, Grethel, until the moon rises, and</p>\n<p>then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn.</p>\n",
        "<p>They will</p>\n<p>show us our way home again.”</p>\n<p>When the moon came, they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the</p>\n<p>many thousands of birds, which fly about in the woods and fields, had</p>\n<p>picked them all up.</p>\n<p>Haensel said to Grethel, “We shall soon find the</p>\n<p>way,” but they did not find it.</p>\n",
        "<p>They walked the whole night and all the next day, from morning till</p>\n<p>evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry,</p>\n<p>for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the</p>\n<p>ground.</p>\n<p>And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no</p>\n<p>longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.</p>\n<p>It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house.</p>\n",
        "<p>They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest.</p>\n<p>If help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness!</p>\n<p>When it was midday, they saw a beautiful Snow-White Bird sitting on a</p>\n<p>bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened</p>\n<p>to it.</p>\n<p>And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew</p>\n<p>away before them.</p>\n",
        "<p>They followed it until they reached a little house,</p>\n<p>on the roof of which it alighted.</p>\n<p>When they came quite up to the little House they saw that it was built</p>\n<p>of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear</p>\n<p>sugar.</p>\n<p>“We will set to work on that,” said Haensel, “and have a good meal.</p>\n<p>I will eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grethel, can eat some of the</p>\n",
        "<p>window; it will taste sweet.”</p>\n<p>Haensel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to try how it</p>\n<p>tasted.</p>\n<p>Grethel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>a soft voice cried from the room:</p>\n<p>“_Nibble, nibble, gnaw!</p>\n",
        "<p>Who nibbles at my door?_”</p>\n<p>but the children went on eating without disturbing themselves.</p>\n<p>Haensel,</p>\n<p>who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it.</p>\n<p>Grethel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and</p>\n<p>enjoyed herself with it.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, leaning on</p>\n",
        "<p>crutches, came creeping out.</p>\n<p>Haensel and Grethel were so terribly</p>\n<p>frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.</p>\n<p>The Old Woman, however, nodded her head, and said, “Oh, you dear</p>\n<p>Children, who has brought you here?</p>\n<p>Do come in, and stay with me.</p>\n<p>No</p>\n",
        "<p>harm shall happen to you.”</p>\n<p>She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house.</p>\n<p>Then she set good food before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar,</p>\n<p>apples, and nuts.</p>\n<p>Afterward she covered two pretty little beds with</p>\n<p>clean white linen, and Haensel and Grethel lay down in them, and</p>\n<p>thought they were in Heaven.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Old Woman had only pretended to be so kind.</p>\n<p>She was really a wicked</p>\n<p>Witch, who lay in wait for children, and who had built the little bread</p>\n<p>house in order to entice them there.</p>\n<p>When a child fell into her power,</p>\n<p>she killed it, cooked, and ate it; and that was a feast-day with her.</p>\n<p>Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen</p>\n",
        "<p>scent like the beasts’, and are aware when human beings draw near.</p>\n<p>When Haensel and Grethel came into her neighborhood, she laughed</p>\n<p>maliciously, and said mockingly, “I have them, they shall not escape me</p>\n<p>again!”</p>\n<p>Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was up.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their</p>\n",
        "<p>plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, “That will be a dainty</p>\n<p>mouthful!”</p>\n<p>Then she seized Haensel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a</p>\n<p>little stable, and shut him in with a grated door.</p>\n<p>He might scream as</p>\n<p>he liked, that was of no use!</p>\n<p>Then she went to Grethel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, “Get up,</p>\n",
        "<p>lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother.</p>\n<p>He is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat.</p>\n<p>When he is fat, I</p>\n<p>will eat him.”</p>\n<p>Grethel began to weep bitterly.</p>\n<p>But it was all in vain, she was forced</p>\n<p>to do what the wicked Witch ordered her.</p>\n",
        "<p>And now the best food was cooked for poor Haensel, while Grethel got</p>\n<p>nothing but crab-shells.</p>\n<p>Every morning the woman crept to the little</p>\n<p>stable, and cried, “Haensel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if</p>\n<p>you will soon be fat.”</p>\n<p>When four weeks had gone by she was seized with impatience and would</p>\n<p>not wait any longer.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ho, there!</p>\n<p>Grethel,” she cried to the girl, “be</p>\n<p>active, and bring some water.</p>\n<p>Let Haensel be fat or lean, to-morrow I</p>\n<p>will kill him, and cook him.”</p>\n<p>Ah!</p>\n<p>how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the</p>\n",
        "<p>water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks!</p>\n<p>“Dear God, do</p>\n<p>help us,” she cried.</p>\n<p>“If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured</p>\n<p>us, we should at any rate have died together!”</p>\n<p>“Just keep your noise to yourself,” said the Old Woman, “all that won’t</p>\n<p>help you at all.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Early in the morning, Grethel had to go out and hang up the cauldron,</p>\n<p>full of water, and light the fire.</p>\n<p>“We will bake first,” said the Old Woman, “I have already heated the</p>\n<p>oven, and kneaded the dough.” She pushed poor Grethel out to the oven,</p>\n<p>from which flames of fire were darting.</p>\n<p>“Creep in,” said the Witch, “and see if it is properly heated, so</p>\n<p>that we can shut the bread in.” And when once Grethel was inside, she</p>\n",
        "<p>intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then eat her, too.</p>\n<p>But Grethel saw what she had in her mind, and would not creep in.</p>\n<p>“Silly Goose,” said the Old Woman; “the door is big enough.</p>\n<p>Just look,</p>\n<p>I can get in myself!” and she crept up and thrust her head in.</p>\n<p>Then she</p>\n<p>fell over into the oven and was miserably burnt to death.</p>\n",
        "<p>Grethel, however, ran as quick as lightning to Haensel, opened his</p>\n<p>little stable, and cried, “Haensel, we are saved!</p>\n<p>The old Witch is</p>\n<p>dead!”</p>\n<p>Then Haensel sprang out like a bird from its cage, when the door is</p>\n<p>opened for it.</p>\n<p>How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance</p>\n",
        "<p>about and kiss each other!</p>\n<p>And as they had no longer any need to fear</p>\n<p>her, they went into the Witch’s house, and in every corner there stood</p>\n<p>chests full of pearls and jewels.</p>\n<p>“These are far better than pebbles!” said Haensel, and thrust into his</p>\n<p>pockets whatever could be got in.</p>\n<p>And Grethel said, “I, too, will take something home with me,” and</p>\n",
        "<p>filled her pinafore full.</p>\n<p>“But now we will go away,” said Haensel, “that we may get out of the</p>\n<p>Witch’s forest.”</p>\n<p>When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of</p>\n<p>water.</p>\n<p>“We cannot get over,” said Haensel, “I see no foot-plank, and no</p>\n<p>bridge.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“And no boat crosses either,” answered Grethel, “but a white duck is</p>\n<p>swimming there.</p>\n<p>If I ask her, she will help us over.” Then she cried:</p>\n<p>“_Little Duck, little Duck, dost thou see,</p>\n<p>Haensel and Grethel are waiting for thee?</p>\n<p>There’s never a plank, nor a bridge in sight,</p>\n<p>Take us across on thy back so white._”</p>\n",
        "<p>The duck came to them, and Haensel seated himself on her back, and</p>\n<p>told his sister to sit by him.</p>\n<p>“No,” replied Grethel, “that will be</p>\n<p>too heavy for the little duck.</p>\n<p>She shall take us across, one after the</p>\n<p>other.”</p>\n<p>The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and</p>\n",
        "<p>had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more</p>\n<p>familiar to them.</p>\n<p>At length, they saw from afar their father’s house.</p>\n<p>Then they began to run, rushed into the parlor, and threw themselves</p>\n<p>into their father’s arms.</p>\n<p>The man had not known one happy hour since he</p>\n<p>had left the children in the forest.</p>\n",
        "<p>The woman, however, was dead.</p>\n<p>Grethel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about</p>\n<p>the room, and Haensel threw one handful after another out of his pocket</p>\n<p>to add to them.</p>\n<p>Then all trouble was at an end, and they lived together</p>\n<p>in perfect happiness.</p>\n<p>My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make</p>\n",

        "<p>great.</p>\n<p>But the child was sickly and small, and so weak that it had to</p>\n<p>be baptized at once.</p>\n<p>The father sent one of the boys in a hurry to the spring, to fetch</p>\n<p>water for the baptism.</p>\n<p>The other six boys ran along with him.</p>\n<p>And as</p>\n",
        "<p>each strove to be the first to fill the jug, it fell into the spring.</p>\n<p>There they stood, and did not know what to do.</p>\n<p>None of them dared to go</p>\n<p>home.</p>\n<p>When they did not come back, the father grew impatient, and said, “They</p>\n<p>have forgotten all about it in a game of play, the wicked boys!”</p>\n<p>Soon he grew afraid lest the child should die without being baptized,</p>\n",
        "<p>and he cried out in anger, “I wish the boys were all turned into</p>\n<p>Ravens!”</p>\n<p>Hardly was the word spoken, before he heard a whirring of wings in</p>\n<p>the air above his head.</p>\n<p>He looked up, and saw seven coal-black Ravens</p>\n<p>flying high and away.</p>\n<p>The parents could not recall the curse.</p>\n",
        "<p>And though they grieved over</p>\n<p>the loss of their seven sons, yet they comforted themselves somewhat</p>\n<p>with their dear little daughter, who soon grew strong and every day</p>\n<p>more beautiful.</p>\n<p>For a long time, she did not know that she had had brothers.</p>\n<p>Her</p>\n<p>parents were careful not to mention them before her.</p>\n",
        "<p>But one day,</p>\n<p>she chanced to overhear some people talking about her, and saying,</p>\n<p>“that the maiden is certainly beautiful, but really to blame for the</p>\n<p>misfortune of her seven brothers.”</p>\n<p>Then she was much troubled, and went to her father and mother, and</p>\n<p>asked if it was true that she had had brothers, and what was become of</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n",
        "<p>The parents did not dare to keep the secret longer, and said that her</p>\n<p>birth was only the innocent cause of what had happened to her brothers.</p>\n<p>But the maiden laid it daily to heart, and thought that she must</p>\n<p>deliver her brothers.</p>\n<p>She had no peace and rest until she set out secretly, and went forth</p>\n<p>into the wide world to seek them out, and set them free, let it cost</p>\n<p>what it might.</p>\n",
        "<p>She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging</p>\n<p>to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little</p>\n<p>pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision</p>\n<p>against weariness.</p>\n<p>And now, she went continually onward, far, far, to the very end of the</p>\n<p>world.</p>\n<p>Then she came to the Sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and</p>\n",

        "<p>against his mouth.</p>\n<p>Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring</p>\n<p>belonging to his father and mother, and said, “God grant that our</p>\n<p>little sister may be here, and then we shall be free.”</p>\n<p>When the maiden, who was standing behind the door watching, heard that</p>\n<p>wish, she came forth, and on this all the Ravens were restored to their</p>\n<p>human form again.</p>\n",

        "<p>“And you, Ash-Maiden,” said he, “what will you have?”</p>\n<p>“Father, break off for me the first branch which knocks against your</p>\n<p>hat on your way home.”</p>\n<p>So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels for the two</p>\n<p>daughters, and on his way home, as he was riding through a green</p>\n<p>thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n",
        "<p>he broke off the branch and took it with him.</p>\n<p>When he reached home he gave the two daughters the things which</p>\n<p>they had wished for, and to Ash-Maiden he gave the branch from the</p>\n<p>hazel-bush.</p>\n<p>Ash-Maiden thanked him, went to her mother’s grave and</p>\n<p>planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears fell down on</p>\n<p>it and watered it.</p>\n",
        "<p>It grew, however, and became a handsome tree.</p>\n<p>Thrice a day Ash-Maiden</p>\n<p>went and sat beneath it, and wept and prayed, and a little White Bird</p>\n<p>always came on the tree.</p>\n<p>And if Ash-Maiden expressed a wish, the bird</p>\n<p>threw down to her what she had wished for.</p>\n<p>It happened that the King gave a feast, which was to last three days.</p>\n",
        "<p>To it all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited,</p>\n<p>in order that his son might choose himself a Bride.</p>\n<p>When the two</p>\n<p>sisters heard that they too were to appear among the number, they were</p>\n<p>delighted.</p>\n<p>They called Ash-Maiden and said, “Comb our hair, brush our shoes, and</p>\n<p>fasten our buckles, for we are going to the feast at the King’s palace.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Ash-Maiden obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to go</p>\n<p>with them to the dance, and she begged her mother to allow her to do so.</p>\n<p>“You go, Ash-Maiden!” said she; “you are dusty and dirty, and would go</p>\n<p>to the feast?</p>\n<p>You have no clothes and shoes, and yet would dance!”</p>\n<p>As, however, Ash-Maiden went on asking, the mother at last said, “I</p>\n<p>have emptied a dish of lentils into the ashes for you.</p>\n",
        "<p>If you have</p>\n<p>picked them out again in two hours, you shall go with us.”</p>\n<p>The maiden went through the back-door into the garden, and called, “You</p>\n<p>tame Pigeons, you Turtledoves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come</p>\n<p>and help me to pick</p>\n<p>“_The good into the pot,</p>\n<p>The bad into the crop!_”</p>\n",

        "<p>You would only be laughed at.”</p>\n<p>And as Ash-Maiden wept at this, the mother said, “If you can pick two</p>\n<p>dishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour, you shall go</p>\n<p>with us.” And she thought to herself, “That she most certainly cannot</p>\n<p>do.”</p>\n<p>When the mother had emptied the two dishes of lentils amongst the</p>\n<p>ashes, the maiden went through the back-door into the garden and cried,</p>\n",

        "<p>both shoes stood all finished on his table.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>was astounded, and did not know what to say.</p>\n<p>He took the shoes in</p>\n<p>his hands to examine them closer, and they were so neatly made that</p>\n<p>there was not one bad stitch in them, just as if they were meant for a</p>\n<p>masterpiece.</p>\n",
        "<p>Soon after, a buyer came in, and as the shoes pleased him well, he paid</p>\n<p>more for them than was customary.</p>\n<p>And, with the money, the shoemaker</p>\n<p>was able to purchase leather for two pairs of shoes.</p>\n<p>He cut them out at night, and next morning was about to set to work</p>\n<p>with fresh courage; but he had no need to do so, for, when he got up,</p>\n<p>they were already made.</p>\n",

        "<p>Now it befell that, one evening not long before Christmas, when the man</p>\n<p>had been cutting out, he said to his wife, before going to bed, “What</p>\n<p>think you, if we were to stay up to-night to see who it is that lends</p>\n<p>us this helping hand?”</p>\n<p>The woman liked the idea, and lighted a candle, and then they hid</p>\n<p>themselves in a corner of the room, behind some clothes which were</p>\n<p>hanging there, and watched.</p>\n",
        "<p>When it was midnight, two pretty tiny naked Little Men came, sat down</p>\n<p>by the shoemaker’s table, took all the work which was cut out before</p>\n<p>them and began to stitch, sew, and hammer so skilfully and so quickly</p>\n<p>with their little fingers, that the shoemaker could not turn away his</p>\n<p>eyes for astonishment.</p>\n<p>They did not stop until all was done, and stood</p>\n<p>finished on the table, and then they ran quickly away.</p>\n",

        "<p>alike, and did not know what to do.</p>\n<p>He did not wish to sell the house,</p>\n<p>because it had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have divided</p>\n<p>the money amongst them.</p>\n<p>At last a plan came into his head, and he said to his sons, “Go into</p>\n<p>the world, and try each of you to learn a trade.</p>\n<p>When you all come</p>\n",
        "<p>back, he who makes the best masterpiece shall have the house.”</p>\n<p>The sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be a</p>\n<p>blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>fixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each went</p>\n<p>his way.</p>\n<p>It chanced that they all found skilful masters, who taught them their</p>\n",
        "<p>trades well.</p>\n<p>The blacksmith had to shoe the King’s horses, and he</p>\n<p>thought to himself, “The house is mine, without doubt.” The barber</p>\n<p>shaved only great people, and he too already looked upon the house as</p>\n<p>his own.</p>\n<p>The fencing-master got many a blow, but he only bit his lip,</p>\n<p>and let nothing vex him; “for,” said he to himself, “if you are afraid</p>\n",
        "<p>of a blow, you’ll never win the house.”</p>\n<p>When the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back home</p>\n<p>to their father.</p>\n<p>But they did not know how to find the best opportunity</p>\n<p>for showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted together.</p>\n<p>As they were sitting thus, all at once a hare came running across the</p>\n<p>field.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ah, ha, just in time!” said the barber.</p>\n<p>So he took his basin</p>\n<p>and soap, and lathered away until the hare came up.</p>\n<p>Then he soaped and</p>\n<p>shaved off the hare’s whiskers whilst he was running at the top of his</p>\n<p>speed, and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair on his body.</p>\n<p>“Well done!” said the old man, “your brothers will have to exert</p>\n",
        "<p>themselves wonderfully, or the house will be yours.”</p>\n<p>Soon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at full</p>\n<p>speed.</p>\n<p>“Now you shall see what I can do, Father,” said the blacksmith.</p>\n<p>So away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off the feet of</p>\n<p>one of the horses whilst he was galloping, and put on four new shoes</p>\n<p>without stopping him.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You are a fine fellow, and as clever as your brother,” said his</p>\n<p>father.</p>\n<p>“I do not know to which I ought to give the house.”</p>\n<p>Then the third son said, “Father, let me have my turn, if you please.”</p>\n<p>And, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and flourished</p>\n<p>it backward and forward above his head so fast that not a drop fell</p>\n<p>upon him.</p>\n",
        "<p>It rained still harder and harder, till at last it came down</p>\n<p>in torrents.</p>\n<p>But he only flourished his sword faster and faster, and</p>\n<p>remained as dry as if he were sitting in a house.</p>\n<p>When his father saw this he was amazed, and said, “This is the</p>\n<p>masterpiece, the house is yours!”</p>\n<p>His brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed before-hand.</p>\n",

        "<p>it was time to go home, he asked, “Goat, have you had enough?”</p>\n<p>The goat answered:</p>\n<p>“_I have eaten so much,</p>\n<p>Not a leaf more I’ll touch,</p>\n<p>Ma!</p>\n<p>Ma!_”</p>\n<p>“Come home, then,” said the youth, and took hold of the cord round her</p>\n",
        "<p>neck, led her into the stable and tied her up securely.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the old tailor, “has the goat had as much food as she</p>\n<p>ought?”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” answered the son, “she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she’ll</p>\n<p>touch.”</p>\n<p>But the father wished to satisfy himself, and went down to the stable,</p>\n<p>stroked the dear animal and asked, “Goat, are you satisfied?”</p>\n",
        "<p>The goat answered:</p>\n<p>“_With what should I be satisfied?</p>\n<p>Among the graves I leapt about,</p>\n<p>And found no food, so went without,</p>\n<p>Ma!</p>\n<p>Ma!_”</p>\n<p>“What do I hear?” cried the tailor, and ran up-stairs and said to the</p>\n",
        "<p>youth, “Hollo, you liar; you said the goat had had enough, and have let</p>\n<p>her go hungry!” and in his anger, he took the yard-measure from the</p>\n<p>wall, and drove him out with blows.</p>\n<p>Next day, it was the turn of the second son, who looked out for a place</p>\n<p>in the fence of the garden, where nothing but good herbs grew.</p>\n<p>And the</p>\n<p>goat cleared them all off.</p>\n",
        "<p>At night, when he wanted to go home, he asked, “Goat, are you</p>\n<p>satisfied?”</p>\n<p>The goat answered:</p>\n<p>“_I have eaten so much,</p>\n<p>Not a leaf more I’ll touch,</p>\n<p>Ma!</p>\n<p>Ma!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Come home, then,” said the youth, and led her home and tied her up in</p>\n<p>the stable.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the old tailor, “has the goat had as much food as she</p>\n<p>ought?”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” answered the son, “she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she’ll</p>\n<p>touch.”</p>\n<p>The tailor would not rely on this, but went down to the stable and</p>\n",
        "<p>said, “Goat, have you had enough?”</p>\n<p>The goat answered:</p>\n<p>“_With what should I be satisfied?</p>\n<p>Among the graves I leapt about,</p>\n<p>And found no food, so went without,</p>\n<p>Ma!</p>\n<p>Ma!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>“The godless wretch!” cried the tailor, “to let such a good animal</p>\n<p>go hungry,” and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the</p>\n<p>yard-measure.</p>\n<p>Now came the turn of the third son, who wanted to do the thing well,</p>\n<p>and sought out some bushes with the finest leaves, and let the goat</p>\n<p>devour them.</p>\n<p>In the evening when he wanted to go home, he asked, “Goat, have you had</p>\n",
        "<p>enough?”</p>\n<p>The goat answered:</p>\n<p>“_I have eaten so much,</p>\n<p>Not a leaf more I’ll touch,</p>\n<p>Ma!</p>\n<p>Ma!_”</p>\n<p>“Come home, then,” said the youth, and led her into the stable, and</p>\n",
        "<p>tied her up.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the old tailor, “has the goat had a proper amount of food?”</p>\n<p>“She has eaten so much, not a leaf more she’ll touch.”</p>\n<p>The tailor did not trust to that, but went down and asked, “Goat, have</p>\n<p>you had enough?”</p>\n<p>The wicked beast answered:</p>\n<p>“_With what should I be satisfied?</p>\n",
        "<p>Among the graves I leapt about,</p>\n<p>And found no leaves, so went without,</p>\n<p>Ma!</p>\n<p>Ma!_”</p>\n<p>“Oh, the brood of liars!” cried the tailor, “each as wicked and</p>\n<p>forgetful of his duty as the other!</p>\n<p>Ye shall no longer make a fool</p>\n",
        "<p>of me,” and, quite beside himself with anger, he ran up-stairs and</p>\n<p>belabored the poor young fellow so vigorously with the yard-measure</p>\n<p>that he sprang out of the house.</p>\n<p>The old tailor was now alone with his goat.</p>\n<p>Next morning he went down</p>\n<p>into the stable, caressed the goat and said, “Come, my dear little</p>\n<p>animal, I myself will take you to feed.”</p>\n",
        "<p>He took her by the rope and conducted her to green hedges, and amongst</p>\n<p>milfoil, and whatever else goats like to eat.</p>\n<p>“There you may for once</p>\n<p>eat to your heart’s content,” said he to her, and let her browse till</p>\n<p>evening.</p>\n<p>Then he asked, “Goat, are you satisfied?” She replied:</p>\n<p>“_I have eaten so much,</p>\n",
        "<p>Not a leaf more I’ll touch,</p>\n<p>Ma!</p>\n<p>Ma!_”</p>\n<p>“Come home, then,” said the tailor, and led her into the stable, and</p>\n<p>tied her fast.</p>\n<p>When he was going away, he turned round again and said, “Well, are you</p>\n<p>satisfied for once?”</p>\n",
        "<p>But the goat did not behave better to him, and cried:</p>\n<p>“_With what should I be satisfied?</p>\n<p>Among the graves I leapt about,</p>\n<p>And found no leaves, so went without,</p>\n<p>Ma!</p>\n<p>Ma!_”</p>\n<p>When the tailor heard that, he was shocked, and saw clearly that he</p>\n",
        "<p>had driven away his three sons without cause.</p>\n<p>“Wait, you ungrateful</p>\n<p>creature,” cried he, “it is not enough to drive you forth, I will mark</p>\n<p>you so that you will no more dare to show yourself amongst honest</p>\n<p>tailors!”</p>\n<p>In great haste, he ran up-stairs, fetched his razor, lathered the</p>\n<p>goat’s head, and shaved her as clean as the palm of his hand.</p>\n",
        "<p>And as</p>\n<p>the yard-measure would have been too good for her, he brought the</p>\n<p>horsewhip, and gave her such cuts with it that she ran away with mighty</p>\n<p>leaps.</p>\n<p>When the tailor was thus left quite alone in his house, he fell into</p>\n<p>great grief, and would gladly have had his sons back again.</p>\n<p>But no one</p>\n",
        "<p>knew whither they were gone.</p>\n<p>The eldest had apprenticed himself to a joiner, and learnt</p>\n<p>industriously and unweariedly, and when the time came for him to go on</p>\n<p>his travels, his master presented him with a little table which had no</p>\n<p>unusual appearance, and was made of common wood.</p>\n<p>But it had one good</p>\n<p>property; if any one put it down, and said:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Little Table!</p>\n<p>Set thyself!_”</p>\n<p>the good Little Table was at once covered with a clean little cloth.</p>\n<p>And a plate was there, and a knife and fork beside it, and dishes with</p>\n<p>boiled meats and roasted meats, as many as there was room for, and a</p>\n<p>great glass of red wine shone so that it made the heart glad.</p>\n<p>The young journeyman thought, “With this you have enough for your whole</p>\n",
        "<p>life!” and went joyously about the world, and never troubled himself</p>\n<p>whether an inn was good or bad, or if anything was to be found in it</p>\n<p>or not.</p>\n<p>When it suited him he did not enter an inn at all, but either</p>\n<p>in the plain, a wood, a meadow, or wherever he fancied, he took his</p>\n<p>Little Table off his back, set it down before him, and said:</p>\n<p>“_Little Table!</p>\n",
        "<p>Set thyself!_”</p>\n<p>and then everything appeared that his heart desired.</p>\n<p>At length, he took it into his head to go back to his father, whose</p>\n<p>anger would now be appeased, and who would now willingly receive him</p>\n<p>with his Wishing-Table.</p>\n<p>It came to pass that on his way home, he</p>\n<p>arrived, one evening, at an inn which was filled with guests.</p>\n",
        "<p>They bade</p>\n<p>him welcome, and invited him to sit and eat with them, for otherwise he</p>\n<p>would have difficulty in getting anything.</p>\n<p>“No,” answered the joiner, “I will not take the few bites out of your</p>\n<p>mouths.</p>\n<p>Rather than that, you shall be my guests.”</p>\n<p>They laughed, and thought he was joking.</p>\n",
        "<p>He, however, placed his wooden</p>\n<p>Little Table in the middle of the room, and said:</p>\n<p>“_Little Table!</p>\n<p>Set thyself!_”</p>\n<p>Instantly it was covered with food, so good that the host could never</p>\n<p>have procured it, and the smell of it arose pleasantly to the noses of</p>\n<p>the guests.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Fall to, dear Friends,” said the joiner.</p>\n<p>And the guests, when they saw that he meant it, did not need to be</p>\n<p>asked twice, but drew near, pulled out their knives and attacked it</p>\n<p>valiantly.</p>\n<p>And what surprised them most, was that when a dish became</p>\n<p>empty, a full one instantly took its place.</p>\n<p>The innkeeper stood in</p>\n",
        "<p>one corner and watched the doings.</p>\n<p>He did not know what to say, but</p>\n<p>thought, “I could easily find use for such a cook as that in my</p>\n<p>kitchen.”</p>\n<p>The joiner and his comrades made merry until late into the night.</p>\n<p>At</p>\n<p>length they lay down to sleep, and the young apprentice also went to</p>\n",
        "<p>bed, and set his Magic Table against the wall.</p>\n<p>The host’s thoughts, however, let him have no rest.</p>\n<p>It occurred to him</p>\n<p>that there was a little old table in his lumber-room, which looked</p>\n<p>just like the apprentice’s.</p>\n<p>And he brought it out quite softly, and</p>\n<p>exchanged it for the Wishing-Table.</p>\n",
        "<p>Next morning, the joiner paid for his bed, took up his table, never</p>\n<p>thinking that he had got a false one, and went his way.</p>\n<p>At midday, he reached his father, who received him with great joy.</p>\n<p>“Well, my dear son, what have you learnt?” said he to him.</p>\n<p>“Father, I have become a joiner.”</p>\n<p>“A good trade,” replied the old man; “but what have you brought back</p>\n<p>with you from your apprenticeship?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Father, the best thing which I have brought back with me is this</p>\n<p>Little Table.”</p>\n<p>The tailor examined it on all sides and said, “You did not make a</p>\n<p>masterpiece, when you made that.</p>\n<p>It is a bad old table.”</p>\n<p>“But it is a table which furnishes itself,” replied the son.</p>\n<p>“When I</p>\n",
        "<p>put it down, and tell it to set itself, the most beautiful dishes stand</p>\n<p>on it, and a wine also which gladdens the heart.</p>\n<p>Just invite all our</p>\n<p>relations and friends.</p>\n<p>They shall refresh and enjoy themselves for</p>\n<p>once, for the table will give them all they require.”</p>\n<p>When the company was assembled, he put his table in the middle of the</p>\n",
        "<p>room and said:</p>\n<p>“_Little Table!</p>\n<p>Set thyself!_”</p>\n<p>but the little table did not bestir itself, and remained just as bare</p>\n<p>as any other table which did not understand language.</p>\n<p>Then the poor</p>\n<p>apprentice became aware that his table had been changed, and was</p>\n",
        "<p>ashamed at having to stand there like a liar.</p>\n<p>The relations, however, mocked him, and were forced to go home without</p>\n<p>having eaten or drunk.</p>\n<p>The father brought out his patches, and began to</p>\n<p>tailor again, but the son went to a master in the craft.</p>\n<p>The second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself to</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n",
        "<p>When his years were over, the master said, “As you have conducted</p>\n<p>yourself so well, I give you an Ass of a peculiar kind, which neither</p>\n<p>draws a cart nor carries a sack.”</p>\n<p>“To what use is he put, then?” asked the young apprentice.</p>\n<p>“He lets gold drop from his mouth,” answered the miller.</p>\n<p>“If you set him</p>\n<p>on a cloth, and say:</p>\n",
        "<p>“‘_Bricklebrit!_’</p>\n<p>the good animal will drop gold pieces for you.”</p>\n<p>“That is a fine thing,” said the apprentice, and thanked the master,</p>\n<p>and went out into the world.</p>\n<p>When he had need of gold, he had only to</p>\n<p>say:</p>\n<p>“_Bricklebrit!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>to his Ass, and it rained gold pieces, and he had nothing to do but</p>\n<p>pick them off the ground.</p>\n<p>Wheresoever he went, the best of everything</p>\n<p>was good enough for him, and the dearer the better, for he had always a</p>\n<p>full purse.</p>\n<p>When he had looked about the world for some time, he thought, “You</p>\n<p>must seek out your father; if you go to him with the Gold-Ass, he will</p>\n",
        "<p>forget his anger, and receive you well.”</p>\n<p>It came to pass, that he reached the same public-house in which his</p>\n<p>brother’s table had been exchanged.</p>\n<p>He led his Ass by the bridle, and</p>\n<p>the host was about to take the animal from him to tie him up, but the</p>\n<p>young apprentice said, “Don’t trouble yourself.</p>\n<p>I will take my gray</p>\n",
        "<p>horse into the stable, and tie him up myself, for I must know where he</p>\n<p>stands.”</p>\n<p>This struck the host as odd, and he thought that a man who was forced</p>\n<p>to look after his Ass himself, could not have much to spend.</p>\n<p>But when</p>\n<p>the stranger put his hand in his pocket and brought out two gold</p>\n<p>pieces, and said he was to provide something good for him, the host</p>\n",
        "<p>opened his eyes wide, and ran and sought out the best he could muster.</p>\n<p>After dinner, the guest asked what he owed.</p>\n<p>The host did not see why he</p>\n<p>should not double the reckoning, and said the apprentice must give two</p>\n<p>more gold pieces.</p>\n<p>He felt in his pocket, but his gold was just at an end.</p>\n<p>“Wait an</p>\n",
        "<p>instant, sir host,” said he, “I will go and fetch some money;” but he</p>\n<p>took the tablecloth with him.</p>\n<p>The host could not imagine what this could mean, and being curious,</p>\n<p>stole after him, and as the guest bolted the stable-door, he peeped</p>\n<p>through a hole left by a knot in the wood.</p>\n<p>The stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried:</p>\n<p>“_Bricklebrit!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>and immediately the beast began to let gold pieces fall, so that it</p>\n<p>fairly rained down money on the ground.</p>\n<p>“Eh, my word!” said the host, “ducats are quickly coined there!</p>\n<p>A purse</p>\n<p>like that is not amiss.”</p>\n<p>The guest paid his score, and went to bed, but in the night the host</p>\n<p>stole down into the stable, led away the master of the mint, and tied</p>\n",
        "<p>up another ass in his place.</p>\n<p>Early next morning, the apprentice went</p>\n<p>away with the ass, and thought that he had his Gold-Ass.</p>\n<p>At midday he reached his father, who rejoiced to see him again, and</p>\n<p>gladly took him in.</p>\n<p>“What have you made of yourself, my Son?” asked the</p>\n<p>old man.</p>\n",
        "<p>“A miller, dear Father,” he answered.</p>\n<p>“What have you brought back with you from your travels?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing else but an ass.”</p>\n<p>“There are asses enough here,” said the father.</p>\n<p>“I would rather have</p>\n<p>had a good goat.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” replied the son, “but it is no common ass, but a Gold-Ass.</p>\n",
        "<p>When</p>\n<p>I say:</p>\n<p>“‘_Bricklebrit!_’</p>\n<p>the good beast opens its mouth and drops a whole sheetful of gold</p>\n<p>pieces.</p>\n<p>Just summon all our relations hither, and I will make them rich</p>\n<p>folk.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“That suits me well,” said the tailor, “for then I shall have no need</p>\n<p>to torment myself any longer with the needle;” and he ran out and</p>\n<p>called the relations together.</p>\n<p>As soon as they were assembled, the miller bade them make way, spread</p>\n<p>out his cloth, and brought the ass into the room.</p>\n<p>“Now watch,” said he,</p>\n<p>and cried:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Bricklebrit!_”</p>\n<p>but no gold pieces fell, and it was clear that the animal knew nothing</p>\n<p>of the art, for every ass does not attain such perfection.</p>\n<p>Then the poor miller pulled a long face, saw that he was betrayed, and</p>\n<p>begged pardon of the relatives, who went home as poor as they came.</p>\n<p>There was no help for it, the old man had to betake him to his needle</p>\n<p>once more, and the youth hired himself to a miller.</p>\n",
        "<p>The third brother had apprenticed himself to a turner, and as that is</p>\n<p>skilled labor, he was the longest in learning.</p>\n<p>His brothers, however,</p>\n<p>told him in a letter how badly things had gone with them, and how the</p>\n<p>innkeeper had cheated them of their beautiful wishing-gifts on the last</p>\n<p>evening before they reached home.</p>\n<p>When the turner had served his time, and had to set out on his travels,</p>\n",
        "<p>as he had conducted himself so well, his master presented him with a</p>\n<p>sack, and said, “There is a Cudgel in it.”</p>\n<p>“I can put on the sack,” said he, “and it may be of good service to me,</p>\n<p>but why should the Cudgel be in it?</p>\n<p>It only makes it heavy.”</p>\n<p>“I will tell you why,” replied the master; “if any one has done</p>\n<p>anything to injure you, do but say:</p>\n",
        "<p>“‘_Cudgel!</p>\n<p>Out of the sack!_’</p>\n<p>and the Cudgel will leap forth among the people, and play such a dance</p>\n<p>on their backs, that they will not be able to stir or move for a week,</p>\n<p>and it will not leave off until you say:</p>\n<p>“‘_Cudgel!</p>\n<p>Into the sack!_’”</p>\n",
        "<p>The apprentice thanked him, put the sack on his back, and when any one</p>\n<p>came too near him, and wished to attack him, he said:</p>\n<p>“_Cudgel!</p>\n<p>Out of the sack!_”</p>\n<p>and instantly the Cudgel sprang out, and dusted the coat or jacket of</p>\n<p>one after the other on their backs, and never stopped until it had</p>\n<p>stripped it off them.</p>\n",
        "<p>And it was done so quickly, that before any one</p>\n<p>was aware, it was already his own turn.</p>\n<p>In the evening, the young turner reached the inn where his brothers</p>\n<p>had been cheated.</p>\n<p>He laid his sack on the table before him, and began</p>\n<p>to talk of all the wonderful things which he had seen in the world.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said he, “people may easily find a Little Table which will cover</p>\n",
        "<p>itself, a Gold-Ass, and things of that kind--extremely good things</p>\n<p>which I by no means despise--but these are nothing in comparison with</p>\n<p>the treasure which I have won for myself, and am carrying about with me</p>\n<p>in my sack there.”</p>\n<p>The innkeeper pricked up his ears.</p>\n<p>“What in the world can that be?”</p>\n<p>thought he.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The sack must be filled with nothing but jewels.</p>\n<p>I ought</p>\n<p>to get them cheap too, for all good things go in threes.”</p>\n<p>When it was time for sleep, the guest stretched himself on the bench,</p>\n<p>and laid his sack beneath him for a pillow.</p>\n<p>When the innkeeper thought</p>\n<p>his guest was lying in a sound sleep, he went to him and pushed and</p>\n",
        "<p>pulled quite gently and carefully at the sack to see if he could</p>\n<p>possibly draw it away and lay another in its place.</p>\n<p>The turner had,</p>\n<p>however, been waiting for this for a long time; and now, just as the</p>\n<p>innkeeper was about to give a hearty tug, he cried:</p>\n<p>“_Cudgel!</p>\n<p>Out of the sack!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>Instantly the little Cudgel came forth, and fell on the innkeeper, and</p>\n<p>gave him a sound thrashing.</p>\n<p>The host cried for mercy.</p>\n<p>But the louder he cried, so much the more</p>\n<p>heavily the Cudgel beat time on his back, until at length he fell to</p>\n<p>the ground exhausted.</p>\n<p>Then the turner said, “If you do not give back the Little Table that</p>\n",
        "<p>sets itself, and the Gold-Ass, the dance shall begin afresh.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” cried the host, quite humbly, “I will gladly bring out</p>\n<p>everything, only make the accursed Kobold creep back into the sack!”</p>\n<p>Then said the apprentice, “I will let mercy take the place of justice,</p>\n<p>but beware of getting into mischief again!” So he cried:</p>\n<p>“_Cudgel!</p>\n<p>Into the sack!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>and let him have rest.</p>\n<p>Next morning, the turner went home to his father with the</p>\n<p>Wishing-Table, and the Gold-Ass.</p>\n<p>The tailor rejoiced when he saw him</p>\n<p>once more, and asked him likewise what he had learned in foreign parts.</p>\n<p>“Dear Father,” said he, “I have become a turner.”</p>\n<p>“A skilled trade,” said the father.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What have you brought back with</p>\n<p>you from your travels?”</p>\n<p>“A precious thing, dear Father,” replied the son, “a Cudgel in the</p>\n<p>sack.”</p>\n<p>“What!” cried the father, “a Cudgel!</p>\n<p>That’s worth your trouble, indeed!</p>\n<p>From every tree you can cut one for yourself.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“But not one like this, dear Father.</p>\n<p>If I say:</p>\n<p>“‘_Cudgel!</p>\n<p>Out of the sack!_’</p>\n<p>the Cudgel springs out and leads any one, who means ill by me, a weary</p>\n<p>dance, and never stops until he lies on the ground and prays for fair</p>\n<p>weather.</p>\n",
        "<p>Look you, with this Cudgel have I got back the Wishing-Table</p>\n<p>and the Gold-Ass, which the thievish innkeeper took away from my</p>\n<p>brothers.</p>\n<p>Now let them both be sent for, and invite all our kinsmen.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>will give them to eat and to drink, and will fill their pockets with</p>\n<p>gold into the bargain.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The old tailor would not quite believe, but nevertheless got the</p>\n<p>relatives together.</p>\n<p>Then the turner spread a cloth in the room, and led</p>\n<p>in the Gold-Ass, and said to his brother, “Now, dear Brother, speak to</p>\n<p>him.”</p>\n<p>The miller said:</p>\n<p>“_Bricklebrit!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>and instantly the gold pieces fell down on the cloth like a</p>\n<p>thunder-shower, and the Ass did not stop until every one of them had so</p>\n<p>much that he could carry no more.</p>\n<p>(I can see in your face that you also</p>\n<p>would have liked to be there!)</p>\n<p>Then the turner brought the Little Table, and said, “Now, dear Brother,</p>\n<p>speak to it.” And scarcely had the carpenter said:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Little Table!</p>\n<p>Set thyself!_”</p>\n<p>than it was spread, and covered with the most exquisite dishes.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>such a meal took place as the good tailor had never yet known in his</p>\n<p>house.</p>\n<p>The whole party of kinsmen stayed together till far in the</p>\n",
        "<p>night, and were all merry and glad.</p>\n<p>The tailor locked away needle and</p>\n<p>thread, yard-measure and goose, in a press, and lived with his three</p>\n<p>sons in joy and splendor.</p>\n<p>What, however, has become of the goat, who was to blame for the tailor</p>\n<p>driving out his three sons?</p>\n<p>That I will tell you.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was ashamed that she had a bald head, and ran to a fox’s hole and</p>\n<p>crept into it.</p>\n<p>When the fox came home, he was met by two great eyes</p>\n<p>shining out of the darkness, and was terrified and ran away.</p>\n<p>A bear</p>\n<p>met him, and as the fox looked quite disturbed, he said, “What is the</p>\n<p>matter with you, brother Fox, why do you look like that?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ah,” answered Redskin, “a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me</p>\n<p>with its fiery eyes.”</p>\n<p>“We will soon drive him out,” said the bear, and went with him to the</p>\n<p>cave and looked in.</p>\n<p>But when he saw the fiery eyes, fear seized him</p>\n<p>likewise.</p>\n<p>He would have nothing to do with the furious beast, and took</p>\n",
        "<p>to his heels.</p>\n<p>The bee met him, and as she saw that he was ill at ease, she said,</p>\n<p>“Bear, you are really pulling a very pitiful face.</p>\n<p>What has become of</p>\n<p>all your jollity?”</p>\n<p>“It is all very well for you to talk,” replied the bear, “a furious</p>\n<p>beast with staring eyes is in Redskin’s house, and we can’t drive him</p>\n",
        "<p>out.”</p>\n<p>The bee said, “Bear, I pity you!</p>\n<p>I am a poor weak creature, whom you</p>\n<p>would not turn aside to look at.</p>\n<p>Yet I believe I can help you.” She</p>\n<p>flew into the fox’s cave, lighted on the goat’s clean, shaved head, and</p>\n<p>stung her so hard that she sprang up crying, “_Ma!</p>\n",
        "<p>ma!_” and ran forth</p>\n<p>into the world like mad; and to this hour no one knows where she has</p>\n<p>gone.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>IRON JOHN</h3>\n<p>Once on a time there was a King who had a great forest near his palace,</p>\n<p>full of all kinds of wild animals.</p>\n",
        "<p>One day he sent out a huntsman to</p>\n<p>shoot him a roe, but he did not come back.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps some accident has befallen him,” said the King, and the next</p>\n<p>day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they</p>\n<p>too stayed away.</p>\n<p>Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said, “Scour</p>\n<p>the whole forest through, and do not give up until ye have found all</p>\n",
        "<p>three.” But of these also, none came home again, and of the pack of</p>\n<p>hounds which they had taken with them, none were seen more.</p>\n<p>From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,</p>\n<p>and it lay in deep stillness and solitude.</p>\n<p>Nothing was seen but</p>\n<p>sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it.</p>\n<p>This lasted for many</p>\n",
        "<p>years, when a strange huntsman came to the King asking for work, and</p>\n<p>offered to go into the dangerous forest.</p>\n<p>The King, however, would not</p>\n<p>give his consent, and said, “It is not safe in there.</p>\n<p>I fear it would</p>\n<p>fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come</p>\n<p>out again.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The huntsman replied, “Lord, I will venture it at my own risk; of fear</p>\n<p>I know nothing.”</p>\n<p>The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>was not long before the dog fell in with some game, and wanted to</p>\n<p>pursue it.</p>\n<p>But hardly had the dog run two steps when he stood before a</p>\n",
        "<p>deep pool and could go no farther.</p>\n<p>Then a naked arm stretched itself</p>\n<p>out of the water, seized him, and drew him under.</p>\n<p>When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come</p>\n<p>with buckets and bale out the water.</p>\n<p>When they could see the bottom,</p>\n<p>there lay a Wild Man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose</p>\n",
        "<p>hair hung over his face down to his knees.</p>\n<p>They bound him with cords,</p>\n<p>and led him away to the castle.</p>\n<p>There was great astonishment over the Wild Man.</p>\n<p>The King had him put</p>\n<p>in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened</p>\n<p>on pain of death, and the Queen herself was to take the key into her</p>\n",
        "<p>keeping.</p>\n<p>And from this time forth, every one could once more go into</p>\n<p>the forest with safety.</p>\n<p>The King had a son, eight years old, who one day was playing in the</p>\n<p>courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the</p>\n<p>cage.</p>\n<p>The boy ran thither and said, “Give me my ball.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Not till you have opened the door for me,” answered the man.</p>\n<p>“No,” said the boy, “I will not do that.</p>\n<p>The King has forbidden it,”</p>\n<p>and ran away.</p>\n<p>The next day he again went and asked for his ball.</p>\n<p>The Wild Man said,</p>\n<p>“Open my door,” but the boy would not.</p>\n",
        "<p>On the third day when the King had ridden out hunting, the boy went</p>\n<p>once more and said, “I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I</p>\n<p>have not the key.”</p>\n<p>Then the Wild Man said, “It lies under your mother’s pillow.</p>\n<p>You can</p>\n<p>get it there.”</p>\n<p>The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the</p>\n",
        "<p>winds, and brought the key.</p>\n<p>The door opened with difficulty, and the</p>\n<p>boy pinched his fingers.</p>\n<p>When it was open, the Wild Man stepped out,</p>\n<p>gave him the golden ball, and hurried away.</p>\n<p>But the boy was afraid.</p>\n<p>He called and cried after him, “Oh, Wild Man,</p>\n",
        "<p>do not go away, or I shall be beaten!”</p>\n<p>The Wild Man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and</p>\n<p>went with hasty steps into the forest.</p>\n<p>When the King came home, he saw the empty cage, and asked the Queen how</p>\n<p>that had happened.</p>\n<p>She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but</p>\n<p>it was gone.</p>\n",
        "<p>She called the boy, but no one answered.</p>\n<p>The King sent out</p>\n<p>people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the</p>\n<p>Royal Court.</p>\n<p>When the Wild Man had reached once more the dark forest, he took the</p>\n",
        "<p>boy down from his shoulder, and said to him, “You will never see your</p>\n<p>father and mother again, but I will keep you with me for you have set</p>\n<p>me free, and I pity you.</p>\n<p>If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well.</p>\n<p>Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than any one in the world.”</p>\n<p>He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept.</p>\n<p>And the next</p>\n",
        "<p>morning, the man took him to a well, and said, “Behold, the gold well</p>\n<p>is as bright and clear as crystal; you shall sit beside it, and take</p>\n<p>care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted.</p>\n<p>I will come</p>\n<p>every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.”</p>\n<p>The boy placed himself by the margin of the well, and often saw a</p>\n<p>golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and he took care</p>\n",
        "<p>that nothing fell in.</p>\n<p>As he was sitting thus, his finger hurt him so</p>\n<p>violently that without thinking he put it in the water.</p>\n<p>He drew it</p>\n<p>quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded.</p>\n<p>And whatsoever</p>\n<p>pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose.</p>\n",
        "<p>In the evening, Iron John came back, looked at the boy, and said, “What</p>\n<p>has happened to the well?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing, nothing,” he answered, and held his finger behind his back,</p>\n<p>that the man might not see it.</p>\n<p>But he said, “You have dipped your finger into the water.</p>\n<p>This time it</p>\n<p>may pass, but take care you do not again let anything get in.”</p>\n",
        "<p>At daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it.</p>\n<p>His finger hurt him again, and he passed it over his head, and then</p>\n<p>unhappily a hair fell down into the well.</p>\n<p>He took it quickly out, but</p>\n<p>it was quite gilded.</p>\n<p>Iron John came, and already knew what had happened.</p>\n<p>“You have let a</p>\n",
        "<p>hair fall into the well,” said he.</p>\n<p>“I will allow you to watch by it</p>\n<p>once more, but if this happens the third time, then the well will be</p>\n<p>polluted, and you can no longer remain with me.”</p>\n<p>On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,</p>\n<p>however much it hurt him.</p>\n<p>But the time was long to him, and he looked</p>\n",
        "<p>at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>And as he</p>\n<p>still bent down more and more trying to look straight into the eyes,</p>\n<p>his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water.</p>\n<p>He raised</p>\n<p>himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was golden,</p>\n<p>and shone like the sun.</p>\n",
        "<p>You may imagine how terrified the poor boy was!</p>\n<p>He took his</p>\n<p>pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man</p>\n<p>might not see it.</p>\n<p>When he came, he already knew everything, and said, “Take off the</p>\n<p>handkerchief.” Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy</p>\n<p>excuse himself as he might, it was of no use.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You have not stood the</p>\n<p>trial, and can no longer stay here.</p>\n<p>Go forth into the world.</p>\n<p>There you</p>\n<p>will learn what poverty is.</p>\n<p>But as you have not a bad heart, and as I</p>\n<p>mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you.</p>\n",
        "<p>If you fall into</p>\n<p>any difficulty, come to the forest and cry, ‘Iron John,’ and then I</p>\n<p>will come and help you.</p>\n<p>My power is great, greater than you think, and</p>\n<p>I have gold and silver in abundance.”</p>\n<p>Then the King’s Son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten</p>\n<p>paths ever onward, until at length he reached a great city.</p>\n",
        "<p>There he</p>\n<p>looked for work, but could find none, and he had learnt nothing by</p>\n<p>which he could help himself.</p>\n<p>At length, he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in.</p>\n<p>The people about Court did not know what use to make of him, but they</p>\n<p>liked him, and told him to stay.</p>\n<p>At last, the cook took him into his</p>\n",
        "<p>service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n<p>Once when it happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered</p>\n<p>him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to</p>\n<p>let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little hat on.</p>\n<p>Such a thing</p>\n<p>as that had never come under the King’s notice, and he said, “When you</p>\n",
        "<p>serve at the royal table you must take off your hat.”</p>\n<p>He answered, “Ah, Lord, I cannot.”</p>\n<p>Then the King had the cook called before him.</p>\n<p>He scolded him, and asked</p>\n<p>how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and said that he</p>\n<p>was to turn him off at once.</p>\n<p>The cook, however, had pity on him, and</p>\n",
        "<p>exchanged him for the gardener’s boy.</p>\n<p>And now, the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and</p>\n<p>bear the wind and bad weather.</p>\n<p>One day in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was</p>\n<p>so warm he took his little hat off that the air might cool him.</p>\n<p>As the</p>\n<p>sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell</p>\n",
        "<p>into the bedroom of the King’s Daughter.</p>\n<p>Up she sprang to see what it</p>\n<p>could be.</p>\n<p>Then she saw the boy, and cried to him, “Boy, bring me a</p>\n<p>wreath of flowers.”</p>\n<p>[Illustration: THE KING’S DAUGHTER PULLED OFF HIS HAT]</p>\n<p>He put his hat on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and</p>\n",
        "<p>bound them together.</p>\n<p>When he was ascending the stairs with them, the</p>\n<p>gardener met him, and said, “How can you take the King’s Daughter a</p>\n<p>garland of such common flowers?</p>\n<p>Go quickly, and get another, and</p>\n<p>seek out the prettiest and rarest.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” replied the boy, “the wild ones have more scent, and will</p>\n",
        "<p>please her better.”</p>\n<p>When he went into the room, the King’s Daughter said, “Take your cap</p>\n<p>off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.”</p>\n<p>He again said, “I cannot.”</p>\n<p>She, however, caught at his hat and pulled it off, and then his golden</p>\n<p>hair rolled down on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>And it was splendid to behold.</p>\n",
        "<p>He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a</p>\n<p>handful of ducats.</p>\n<p>With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the</p>\n<p>gold pieces.</p>\n<p>He took them to the gardener, and said, “I give them to</p>\n<p>your children, they may play with them.”</p>\n<p>The following day, the King’s Daughter again called to him that he was</p>\n",
        "<p>to bring her a wreath of field-flowers.</p>\n<p>When he went in with it, she</p>\n<p>snatched at his hat, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held</p>\n<p>it fast with both hands.</p>\n<p>She again gave him a handful of ducats.</p>\n<p>But he</p>\n<p>would not keep them, and presented them to the gardener as playthings</p>\n",
        "<p>for his children.</p>\n<p>On the third day, things went just the same.</p>\n<p>She could not get his hat</p>\n<p>away from him, and he would not have her money.</p>\n<p>Not long afterward, the country was overrun by war.</p>\n<p>The King gathered</p>\n<p>together his people, and did not know whether or not he could overcome</p>\n",
        "<p>the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army.</p>\n<p>Then said the gardener’s boy, “I am grown up, and will go to the wars</p>\n<p>also, only give me a horse.”</p>\n<p>The others laughed, and said, “Seek one for yourself when we are gone.</p>\n<p>We will leave one behind us in the stable for you.”</p>\n<p>When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and got the horse.</p>\n<p>It was lame of one foot, and limped _hobblety jig, hobblety jig_.</p>\n",
        "<p>Nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest.</p>\n<p>When he</p>\n<p>came to the outskirts, he called “Iron John” three times so loudly that</p>\n<p>it echoed through the trees.</p>\n<p>Thereupon the Wild Man appeared immediately, and said, “What do you</p>\n<p>desire?”</p>\n<p>“I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“That you shall have, and still more than you ask.” Then the Wild Man</p>\n<p>went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy</p>\n<p>came out of it, who led a horse that snorted, and could hardly be</p>\n<p>restrained.</p>\n<p>Behind them followed a great troop of soldiers entirely</p>\n<p>equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.</p>\n<p>The youth made</p>\n",
        "<p>over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and</p>\n<p>rode at the head of the soldiers.</p>\n<p>When he drew near the battle-field, a great part of the King’s men</p>\n<p>had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way.</p>\n<p>Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a</p>\n<p>hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him.</p>\n<p>They began</p>\n",
        "<p>to fly, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a</p>\n<p>single man left.</p>\n<p>Instead, however, of returning to the King, he conducted his troop by</p>\n<p>side-roads to the forest, and called Iron John.</p>\n<p>“What do you desire?” asked the Wild Man.</p>\n<p>“Take back your horse and troops, and give me my three-legged horse</p>\n<p>again.” All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his</p>\n",
        "<p>three-legged horse.</p>\n<p>When the King returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him,</p>\n<p>and wished him joy of his victory.</p>\n<p>“I am not the one who carried away</p>\n<p>the victory,” said he, “but a stranger Knight who came to my assistance</p>\n<p>with his soldiers.” The daughter wanted to hear who the strange Knight</p>\n<p>was, but the King did not know, and said, “He followed the enemy, and I</p>\n",
        "<p>did not see him again.”</p>\n<p>She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and</p>\n<p>said, “He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others</p>\n<p>have been mocking him, and crying, ‘Here comes our hobblety jig back</p>\n<p>again!’ They asked, too, ‘Under what hedge have you been lying sleeping</p>\n<p>all the time?’ He, however, answered, ‘I did the best of all, and it</p>\n<p>would have gone badly without me.’ And then he was ridiculed still</p>\n",
        "<p>more.”</p>\n<p>The King said to his daughter, “I will proclaim a great feast that</p>\n<p>shall last for three days, and you shall throw a Golden Apple.</p>\n<p>Perhaps</p>\n<p>the unknown will come to it.”</p>\n<p>When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and</p>\n<p>called Iron John.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What do you desire?” asked he.</p>\n<p>“That I may catch the King’s Daughter’s Golden Apple.”</p>\n<p>“It is as safe as if you had it already,” said Iron John.</p>\n<p>“You shall</p>\n<p>likewise have a suit of red armor for the occasion, and ride on a</p>\n<p>spirited chestnut horse.”</p>\n<p>When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place</p>\n",
        "<p>amongst the Knights, and was recognized by no one.</p>\n<p>The King’s Daughter</p>\n<p>came forward, and threw a Golden Apple to the Knights.</p>\n<p>None of them</p>\n<p>caught it but he; only as soon as he had it, he galloped away.</p>\n<p>On the second day, Iron John equipped him as a white Knight, and gave</p>\n<p>him a white horse.</p>\n",
        "<p>Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and</p>\n<p>he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it.</p>\n<p>The King grew angry, and said, “That is not allowed.</p>\n<p>He must appear</p>\n<p>before me and tell his name.” He gave the order that if the Knight who</p>\n<p>caught the apple should go away again, they should pursue him, and, if</p>\n<p>he would not come back willingly, they should cut him down and stab him.</p>\n",
        "<p>On the third day, he received from Iron John a suit of black armor and</p>\n<p>a black horse.</p>\n<p>Again he caught the apple.</p>\n<p>But when he was riding off</p>\n<p>with it, the King’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near</p>\n<p>that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword.</p>\n<p>The youth</p>\n",
        "<p>nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that</p>\n<p>the helmet fell from his head, and they could see that he had golden</p>\n<p>hair.</p>\n<p>They rode back and announced this to the King.</p>\n<p>The following day, the King’s Daughter asked the gardener about his</p>\n<p>boy.</p>\n<p>“He is at work in the garden.</p>\n",
        "<p>The queer creature has been at the</p>\n<p>festival too, and only came home yesterday evening.</p>\n<p>He has likewise</p>\n<p>shown my children three Golden Apples which he has won.”</p>\n<p>The King had him summoned into his presence.</p>\n<p>He came and again had his</p>\n<p>hat on his head.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the King’s Daughter went up to him and took it</p>\n<p>off.</p>\n<p>Then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so</p>\n<p>handsome that all were amazed.</p>\n<p>“Are you the Knight who came every day to the festival, always in</p>\n<p>different colors, and who caught the three Golden Apples?” asked the</p>\n<p>King.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Yes,” answered he, “and here are the apples,” and he took them out</p>\n<p>of his pocket, and returned them to the King.</p>\n<p>“If you desire further</p>\n<p>proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they</p>\n<p>followed me.</p>\n<p>But I am likewise the Knight who helped you win your</p>\n<p>victory over your enemies.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy.</p>\n<p>Tell</p>\n<p>me, who is your father?”</p>\n<p>“My father is a mighty King, and gold have I in plenty as much as I</p>\n<p>require.”</p>\n<p>“I well see,” said the King, “that I owe thanks to you.</p>\n<p>Can I do</p>\n",
        "<p>anything to please you?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered he, “that indeed you can.</p>\n<p>Give me your daughter to</p>\n<p>wife.”</p>\n<p>The maiden laughed, and said, “He does not stand much on ceremony, but</p>\n<p>I have already seen by his golden hair that he is no gardener’s boy,”</p>\n<p>and then she went and kissed him.</p>\n",
        "<p>His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight,</p>\n<p>for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped,</p>\n<p>the doors opened, and a stately King came in with a great retinue.</p>\n<p>He went up to the youth, embraced him and said, “I am Iron John, and</p>\n<p>was by enchantment a Wild Man, but you have set me free.</p>\n",
        "<p>All the</p>\n<p>treasures which I possess, shall be yours.”</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>CLEVER ELSIE</h3>\n<p>There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.</p>\n<p>And when she had grown up her father said, “We will get her married.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the mother, “if only any one would come who would have her.”</p>\n",
        "<p>At length a man came from a distance, and wooed her, who was called</p>\n<p>Hans.</p>\n<p>But he made one condition, that Clever Elsie should be really</p>\n<p>wise.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” said the father, “she’s sharp enough.”</p>\n<p>And the mother said, “Oh, she can see the wind coming up the street,</p>\n<p>and hear the flies coughing.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Well,” said Hans, “if she is not really wise, I won’t have her.”</p>\n<p>When they were sitting at dinner, and had eaten, the mother said,</p>\n<p>“Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.”</p>\n<p>Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar,</p>\n<p>and tapped the lid briskly as she went that the time might not appear</p>\n<p>long.</p>\n<p>When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before</p>\n",
        "<p>the barrel, so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her</p>\n<p>back or do herself any unexpected injury.</p>\n<p>Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the</p>\n<p>beer was running, she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at</p>\n<p>the wall.</p>\n<p>And after much peering here and there, saw a pickaxe exactly</p>\n<p>above her, which the masons had left there by mistake.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said, “If I get Hans, and we have a</p>\n<p>child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw</p>\n<p>beer, then the pickaxe will fall on his head and kill him.” Then she</p>\n<p>sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the</p>\n<p>misfortune which lay before her.</p>\n<p>Those upstairs waited for the drink, but Clever Elsie still did not</p>\n<p>come.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the woman said to the servant, “Just go down into the cellar</p>\n<p>and see where Elsie is.”</p>\n<p>The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming</p>\n<p>loudly.</p>\n<p>“Elsie, why do you weep?” asked the maid.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” she answered, “have I not reason to weep?</p>\n<p>If I get Hans, and we</p>\n",
        "<p>have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pickaxe</p>\n<p>may fall on his head, and kill him.”</p>\n<p>Then said the maid, “What a clever Elsie we have!” and sat down beside</p>\n<p>her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.</p>\n<p>After a while, as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were</p>\n<p>thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy, “Just go down into the</p>\n<p>cellar and see where Elsie and the girl are.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both</p>\n<p>weeping together.</p>\n<p>Then he asked, “Why are you weeping?”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said Elsie, “have I not reason to weep?</p>\n<p>If I get Hans, and we</p>\n<p>have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pickaxe</p>\n<p>will fall on his head and kill him.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then said the boy, “What a clever Elsie we have!” and sat down by her,</p>\n<p>and likewise began to howl loudly.</p>\n<p>Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he did not return, the man</p>\n<p>said to the woman, “Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie</p>\n<p>is!”</p>\n<p>The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their</p>\n<p>lamentations, and inquired what was the cause.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then Elsie told her</p>\n<p>also, that her future child was to be killed by the pickaxe, when it</p>\n<p>grew big and had to draw beer, and the pickaxe fell down.</p>\n<p>Then said the mother likewise, “What a clever Elsie we have!” and sat</p>\n<p>down and wept with them.</p>\n<p>The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back</p>\n<p>and his thirst grew ever greater, he said, “I must go into the cellar</p>\n",
        "<p>myself and see where Elsie is.”</p>\n<p>But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together</p>\n<p>crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie’s child was the cause,</p>\n<p>and that Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and</p>\n<p>that it might be killed by the pickaxe, if it should happen to be</p>\n<p>sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell, he</p>\n<p>cried, “Oh, what a clever Elsie!” and sat down, and likewise wept with</p>\n",
        "<p>them.</p>\n<p>The Bridegroom stayed up-stairs alone for a long time; then as no one</p>\n<p>came back he thought, “They must be waiting for me below.</p>\n<p>I, too, must</p>\n<p>go there and see what they are about.”</p>\n<p>When he got down, all five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting</p>\n<p>quite piteously, each outdoing the other.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What misfortune has happened then?” asked he.</p>\n<p>“Ah, dear Hans,” said Elsie, “if we marry each other and have a child,</p>\n<p>and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink,</p>\n<p>then the pickaxe which has been left up there might dash his brains</p>\n<p>out, if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?”</p>\n<p>“Come,” said Hans, “more understanding than that is not needed for my</p>\n<p>household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,” and he</p>\n",
        "<p>seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.</p>\n<p>After Hans had had her some time, he said, “Wife, I am going out to</p>\n<p>work and earn money for us.</p>\n<p>Go into the field and cut the corn, that we</p>\n<p>may have some bread.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.”</p>\n<p>After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth, and took</p>\n",
        "<p>it into the field with her.</p>\n<p>When she came to the field she said to</p>\n<p>herself, “What shall I do?</p>\n<p>Shall I shear first, or shall I eat first?</p>\n<p>Oh, I will eat first.”</p>\n<p>Then she emptied her basin of broth, and when she was fully satisfied,</p>\n<p>she once more said, “What shall I do?</p>\n",
        "<p>Shall I shear first, or shall I</p>\n<p>sleep first?</p>\n<p>I will sleep first.” Then she lay down among the corn and</p>\n<p>fell asleep.</p>\n<p>Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>said he, “What a clever Elsie I have.</p>\n",
        "<p>She is so industrious, that she</p>\n<p>does not even come home to eat.”</p>\n<p>As, however, she still stayed away, and it was evening, Hans went out</p>\n<p>to see what she had cut.</p>\n<p>But nothing was cut, and she was lying among</p>\n<p>the corn, asleep.</p>\n<p>Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler’s net</p>\n",
        "<p>with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on</p>\n<p>sleeping.</p>\n<p>Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his</p>\n<p>chair and worked.</p>\n<p>At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got</p>\n<p>up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each</p>\n<p>step which she took.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then she was frightened, and became uncertain</p>\n<p>whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said, “Is it I, or is</p>\n<p>it not I?”</p>\n<p>But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in</p>\n<p>doubt.</p>\n<p>At length she thought, “I will go home and ask if it be I, or if</p>\n<p>it be not I.</p>\n",
        "<p>They will be sure to know.”</p>\n<p>She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut.</p>\n<p>Then she knocked</p>\n<p>at the window and cried, “Hans, is Elsie within?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered Hans, “she is within.”</p>\n<p>Hereupon she was terrified, and said, “Ah, heavens!</p>\n<p>Then it is not I,”</p>\n",
        "<p>and went to another door.</p>\n<p>But when the people heard the jingling of the bells, they would not</p>\n<p>open it, and she could get in nowhere.</p>\n<p>Then she ran out of the village,</p>\n<p>and no one has seen her since.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE BREMEN TOWN-MUSICIANS</h3>\n",
        "<p>A certain man had a Donkey, which had carried the corn-sacks to the</p>\n<p>mill faithfully for many a long year; but his strength was going, and</p>\n<p>he was growing more and more unfit for work.</p>\n<p>Then his master began to consider how he might best save his keep; but</p>\n<p>the Donkey, seeing that no good wind was blowing, ran away and set out</p>\n<p>on the road to Bremen.</p>\n<p>“There,” he thought, “I can surely be town-musician.”</p>\n",
        "<p>When he had walked some distance, he found a Hound lying on the road,</p>\n<p>gasping like one who had run till he was tired.</p>\n<p>“What are you gasping so for, you big fellow?” asked the Donkey.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” replied the Hound, “as I am old, and daily grow weaker and no</p>\n<p>longer can hunt, my master wants to kill me.</p>\n<p>So I have taken to flight.</p>\n<p>But now how am I to earn my bread?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I tell you what,” said the Donkey, “I am going to Bremen, and shall</p>\n<p>be town-musician there.</p>\n<p>Come with me and engage yourself also as a</p>\n<p>musician.</p>\n<p>I will play the lute, and you shall beat the kettledrum.”</p>\n<p>The Hound agreed, and on they went.</p>\n<p>Before long, they came to a Cat, sitting on the path, with a face like</p>\n",
        "<p>three rainy days!</p>\n<p>“Now then, old shaver, what has gone askew with you?” asked the Donkey.</p>\n<p>“Who can be merry when his neck is in danger?” answered the Cat.</p>\n<p>“Because I am now getting old, and my teeth are worn to stumps, and I</p>\n<p>prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than hunt about after mice,</p>\n<p>my mistress wants to drown me, so I have run away.</p>\n<p>But now good advice</p>\n",
        "<p>is scarce.</p>\n<p>Where am I to go?”</p>\n<p>“Come with us to Bremen.</p>\n<p>You understand night-music, so you can be a</p>\n<p>town-musician.”</p>\n<p>The Cat thought well of it, and went with them.</p>\n<p>After this the three fugitives came to a farmyard, where the Cock was</p>\n",
        "<p>sitting upon the gate, crowing with all his might.</p>\n<p>“Your crow goes through and through one,” said the Donkey.</p>\n<p>“What is the</p>\n<p>matter?”</p>\n<p>“I have been foretelling fine weather, because it is the day on</p>\n<p>which Our Lady washes the Christ-child’s little shirts, and wants to</p>\n<p>dry them,” said the Cock.</p>\n",
        "<p>“But guests are coming for Sunday, so the</p>\n<p>housewife has no pity, and has told the cook that she intends to eat me</p>\n<p>in the soup to-morrow.</p>\n<p>This evening I am to have my head cut off.</p>\n<p>Now I</p>\n<p>am crowing at full pitch while I can.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, but Red-Comb,” said the Donkey, “you had better come away with</p>\n",
        "<p>us.</p>\n<p>We are going to Bremen.</p>\n<p>You can find something better than death</p>\n<p>everywhere.</p>\n<p>You have a good voice, and if we make music together, it</p>\n<p>must have some quality!”</p>\n<p>The Cock agreed to this plan, and all four went on together.</p>\n",
        "<p>They could not, however, reach the city of Bremen in one day, and in</p>\n<p>the evening they came to a forest where they meant to pass the night.</p>\n<p>The Donkey and the Hound laid themselves down under a large tree.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>Cat and the Cock settled themselves in the branches; but the Cock flew</p>\n<p>right to the top, where he was most safe.</p>\n<p>Before he went to sleep, he looked round on all the four sides, and</p>\n",
        "<p>thought he saw in the distance a little spark burning.</p>\n<p>So he called out</p>\n<p>to his companions that there must be a house not far off, for he saw a</p>\n<p>light.</p>\n<p>The Donkey said, “If so, we had better get up and go on, for the</p>\n<p>shelter here is bad.”</p>\n<p>The Hound thought that a few bones with some meat would do him good too!</p>\n",
        "<p>They made their way to the place where the light was, and soon saw</p>\n<p>it shine brighter and grow larger, until they came to a well-lighted</p>\n<p>robber’s house.</p>\n<p>The Donkey, as the biggest, went to the window and</p>\n<p>looked in.</p>\n<p>“What do you see, my Grey-Horse?” asked the Cock.</p>\n<p>“What do I see?” answered the Donkey; “a table covered with good things</p>\n",
        "<p>to eat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves.”</p>\n<p>“That would be the sort of thing for us,” said the Cock.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes!</p>\n<p>ah, how I wish we were there!” said the Donkey.</p>\n<p>Then the animals took counsel together as to how they could drive away</p>\n<p>the robbers, and at last they thought of a plan.</p>\n<p>The Donkey was to</p>\n",
        "<p>place himself with his forefeet upon the window-ledge, the Hound was</p>\n<p>to jump on the Donkey’s back, the Cat was to climb upon the Hound, and</p>\n<p>lastly the Cock was to fly up and perch upon the head of the Cat.</p>\n<p>When this was done, at a given signal, they began to perform their</p>\n<p>music together.</p>\n<p>The Donkey brayed, the Hound barked, the Cat mewed, and</p>\n<p>the Cock crowed.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then they burst through the window into the room, so</p>\n<p>that the glass clattered!</p>\n<p>At this horrible din, the robbers sprang up, thinking no otherwise</p>\n<p>than that a ghost had come in, and fled in a great fright out into the</p>\n<p>forest.</p>\n<p>The four companions now sat down at the table, well content with what</p>\n<p>was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a month.</p>\n",
        "<p>As soon as the four minstrels had done, they put out the light, and</p>\n<p>each sought for himself a sleeping-place according to his nature and</p>\n<p>to what suited him.</p>\n<p>The Donkey laid himself down upon some straw in</p>\n<p>the yard, the Hound behind the door, the Cat upon the hearth near the</p>\n<p>warm ashes, and the Cock perched himself upon a beam of the roof.</p>\n<p>Being</p>\n",
        "<p>tired with their long walk, they soon went to sleep.</p>\n<p>When it was past midnight, the robbers saw from afar that the light was</p>\n<p>no longer burning in their house, and all appeared quiet.</p>\n<p>The captain said, “We ought not to have let ourselves be frightened out</p>\n<p>of our wits;” and ordered one of them to go and examine the house.</p>\n<p>The messenger finding all still, went into the kitchen to light a</p>\n<p>candle, and, taking the glistening fiery eyes of the Cat for live</p>\n",
        "<p>coals, he held a lucifer-match to them to light it.</p>\n<p>But the Cat did not</p>\n<p>understand the joke, and flew in his face, spitting and scratching.</p>\n<p>He was dreadfully frightened, and ran to the back door, but the Dog,</p>\n<p>who lay there, sprang up and bit his leg.</p>\n<p>Then, as he ran across the yard by the straw-heap, the Donkey gave him</p>\n<p>a smart kick with his hind foot.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Cock, too, who had been awakened</p>\n<p>by the noise, and had become lively, cried down from the beam:</p>\n<p>“_Kicker-ee-ricker-ee-ree!_”</p>\n<p>Then the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain, and said,</p>\n<p>“Ah, there is a horrible Witch sitting in the house, who spat on me</p>\n<p>and scratched my face with her long claws.</p>\n<p>By the door stands a man</p>\n",
        "<p>with a knife, who stabbed me in the leg.</p>\n<p>In the yard there lies a black</p>\n<p>monster, who beat me with a wooden club.</p>\n<p>And above, upon the roof, sits</p>\n<p>the judge, who called out:</p>\n<p>“‘_Bring the rogue here to me!_’</p>\n<p>so I got away as well as I could.”</p>\n",
        "<p>After this the robbers did not trust themselves in the house again.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>it suited the four musicians of Bremen so well that they did not care</p>\n<p>to leave it any more.</p>\n<p>And the mouth of him who last told this story, is still warm.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE SIX SWANS</h3>\n",
        "<p>Once upon a time, a certain King was hunting in a great forest, and he</p>\n<p>chased a wild beast so eagerly that none of his attendants could follow</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>When evening drew near, he stopped and looked around him, and saw</p>\n<p>that he had lost his way.</p>\n<p>He sought a way out, but could find none.</p>\n<p>Then he perceived an Old Woman with a head which nodded all the time,</p>\n",
        "<p>who came toward him, but she was a Witch.</p>\n<p>“Good woman,” said he to her, “can you not show me the way through the</p>\n<p>forest?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, Lord King,” she answered, “that I certainly can, but on one</p>\n<p>condition, and if you do not fulfill that, you will never get out of</p>\n<p>the forest, and will die of hunger in it.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of a condition is it?” asked the King.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I have a daughter,” said the old woman, “who is as beautiful as any</p>\n<p>one in the world, and well deserves to be your wife.</p>\n<p>If you will make</p>\n<p>her your Queen, I will show you the way out of the forest.”</p>\n<p>In the anguish of his heart the King consented, and the old woman led</p>\n<p>him to her little hut, where her daughter was sitting by the fire.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",
        "<p>received the King as if she had been expecting him.</p>\n<p>He saw that she was</p>\n<p>very beautiful, but still she did not please him, and he could not look</p>\n<p>at her without secret horror.</p>\n<p>After he had taken the maiden up on his horse, the old woman showed him</p>\n<p>the way, and the King reached his royal palace again, where the wedding</p>\n<p>was celebrated.</p>\n",
        "<p>The King had already been married once, and had by his first wife,</p>\n<p>seven children, six boys and a girl, whom he loved better than anything</p>\n<p>else in the world.</p>\n<p>As he now feared that the new Queen might not treat</p>\n<p>them well, and even do them some injury, he took them to a lonely</p>\n<p>castle which stood in the midst of a forest.</p>\n<p>It lay concealed, and the</p>\n",
        "<p>way was so difficult to find, that he himself would not have found it</p>\n<p>at all, if a Wise Woman had not given him a ball of yarn with wonderful</p>\n<p>properties.</p>\n<p>When he threw it down before him, it unrolled itself and</p>\n<p>showed him his path.</p>\n<p>The King, however, went so frequently to visit his dear children, that</p>\n<p>the Queen noticed his absence.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was curious and wanted to know what</p>\n<p>he did when he was alone in the forest.</p>\n<p>She gave a great deal of money</p>\n<p>to his servants, and they betrayed the secret to her, and told her</p>\n<p>likewise of the ball which alone could point out the way.</p>\n<p>And now she knew no rest until she had learnt where the King kept the</p>\n<p>ball of yarn.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then she made little shirts of white silk, and as she had</p>\n<p>learnt the art of witchcraft from her mother, she sewed a charm inside</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n<p>And one day, when the King had ridden forth to hunt, she took the</p>\n<p>little shirts and went into the forest, and the ball showed her the</p>\n<p>way.</p>\n<p>The children, who saw from a distance that some one was approaching,</p>\n",
        "<p>thought that their dear father was coming to them, and full of joy,</p>\n<p>ran to meet him.</p>\n<p>Then she threw one of the little shirts over each of</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n<p>And no sooner had the shirts touched their bodies than they were</p>\n<p>changed into Swans, and flew away over the forest.</p>\n<p>The Queen went home quite delighted, and thought she had got rid of all</p>\n",
        "<p>the children, but the girl had not run out with her brothers, and the</p>\n<p>Queen knew nothing about her.</p>\n<p>Next day, the King went to visit his children, but found no one but the</p>\n<p>little girl.</p>\n<p>“Where are your brothers?” asked the King.</p>\n<p>“Alas, dear Father,” she answered, “they have gone away and left me</p>\n<p>alone!” and she told him that she had seen from her little window, how</p>\n",
        "<p>her brothers had flown away over the forest in the shape of Swans.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>she showed him the feathers, which they had let fall in the courtyard,</p>\n<p>and which she had picked up.</p>\n<p>The King mourned, but he did not think that the Queen had done this</p>\n<p>wicked deed.</p>\n<p>And as he feared that the girl also would be stolen from</p>\n",
        "<p>him, he wanted to take her away.</p>\n<p>But she was afraid of the Queen,</p>\n<p>and entreated the King to let her stay just one night more in the</p>\n<p>forest-castle.</p>\n<p>The poor girl thought, “I can no longer remain here.</p>\n<p>I will go and seek</p>\n<p>my brothers.” And when night came, she ran away, and went straight into</p>\n",
        "<p>the forest.</p>\n<p>She walked the whole night long, and next day also without stopping,</p>\n<p>until she could go no farther for weariness.</p>\n<p>Then she saw a forest-hut,</p>\n<p>and went into it, and found a room with six little beds.</p>\n<p>She did not</p>\n<p>venture to get into any of them, but crept under one, and lay down</p>\n",
        "<p>on the hard ground, to pass the night there.</p>\n<p>Just before sunset she</p>\n<p>heard a rustling, and saw six Swans come flying in at the window.</p>\n<p>They alighted on the ground and blew at each other, and blew all the</p>\n<p>feathers off, and their swan’s skins stripped off like a shirt.</p>\n<p>Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",
        "<p>rejoiced and crept forth from beneath the bed.</p>\n<p>The brothers were not</p>\n<p>less delighted to see their little sister, but their joy was short.</p>\n<p>“Here can you not abide,” they said to her.</p>\n<p>“This is a shelter for</p>\n<p>robbers.</p>\n<p>If they come home and find you, they will kill you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“But can you not protect me?” asked the little sister.</p>\n<p>“No,” they replied, “only for one quarter of an hour each evening, can</p>\n<p>we lay aside our swan’s skins and have our human form.</p>\n<p>After that, we</p>\n<p>are once more turned into Swans.”</p>\n<p>The little sister wept, and said, “Can you not be set free?”</p>\n<p>“Alas, no,” they answered, “the conditions are too hard!</p>\n",
        "<p>For six years</p>\n<p>you may neither speak nor laugh, and in that time you must sew together</p>\n<p>six little shirts of Star-Flowers for us.</p>\n<p>And if one single word falls</p>\n<p>from your lips, all your work will be lost.”</p>\n<p>And when the brothers had said this, the quarter of an hour was over,</p>\n<p>and they flew out of the window again as Swans.</p>\n",
        "<p>[Illustration: THE PRINCESS WENT OUT AND GATHERED STAR-FLOWERS]</p>\n<p>The maiden, however, resolved to deliver her brothers, even if it</p>\n<p>should cost her her life.</p>\n<p>She left the hut, went into the midst of the</p>\n<p>forest, seated herself on a tree, and there passed the night.</p>\n<p>Next</p>\n<p>morning, she went out and gathered Star-Flowers and began to sew.</p>\n",
        "<p>She could not speak to any one, and she had no wish to laugh.</p>\n<p>She sat</p>\n<p>there and looked at nothing but her work.</p>\n<p>When she had spent a long time there, it came to pass that the King of</p>\n<p>the country was hunting in the forest, and his huntsmen came to the</p>\n<p>tree on which the maiden was sitting.</p>\n<p>They called to her, and said, “Who are you?” But she made no answer.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Come down to us,” said they.</p>\n<p>“We will not do you any harm.”</p>\n<p>She only shook her head.</p>\n<p>As they pressed her further with questions,</p>\n<p>she threw her golden necklace down to them, and thought to content them</p>\n<p>with that.</p>\n<p>They, however, did not cease, and then she threw her girdle</p>\n",
        "<p>down to them, and as this also was to no use, her garters, and little</p>\n<p>by little everything which she had on that she could do without, until</p>\n<p>she had nothing left but her shift.</p>\n<p>The huntsmen, however, did not let</p>\n<p>themselves be turned aside by that, but climbed the tree and fetched</p>\n<p>the maiden down and led her before the King.</p>\n<p>The King asked, “Who are you?</p>\n",
        "<p>What are you doing on the tree?”</p>\n<p>But she did not answer.</p>\n<p>He put the question in every language that he</p>\n<p>knew, but she remained as mute as a fish.</p>\n<p>As she was so beautiful, the</p>\n<p>King’s heart was touched, and he was smitten with a great love for her.</p>\n<p>He put his mantle on her, took her before him on his horse, and carried</p>\n",
        "<p>her to his castle.</p>\n<p>Then he caused her to be dressed in rich garments, and she shone in her</p>\n<p>beauty like bright daylight, but no word could be drawn from her.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>placed her by his side at table, and her modest bearing and courtesy</p>\n<p>pleased him so much, that he said, “She is the one whom I wish to</p>\n<p>marry, and no other woman in the world.” And a few days after, he</p>\n",
        "<p>united himself to her.</p>\n<p>The King, however, had a wicked mother, who was dissatisfied with his</p>\n<p>marriage and spoke ill of the young Queen.</p>\n<p>“Who knows,” said she, “from</p>\n<p>whence comes the creature, who can’t speak?</p>\n<p>She is not worthy of a</p>\n<p>King!”</p>\n",
        "<p>After a year had passed, when the Queen brought her first child into</p>\n<p>the world, the old woman took it away from her and smeared her mouth</p>\n<p>with blood as she slept.</p>\n<p>Then she went to the King and accused the</p>\n<p>Queen of being a man-eater.</p>\n<p>The King would not believe it, and would</p>\n<p>not suffer any one to do her injury.</p>\n",
        "<p>She, however, sat continually</p>\n<p>sewing at the shirts, and cared for nothing else.</p>\n<p>The next time, when she again bore a beautiful boy, the false old</p>\n<p>woman used the same treachery, but the King could not bring himself to</p>\n<p>believe her words.</p>\n<p>He said, “She is too pious and good to do anything</p>\n<p>of that kind.</p>\n",
        "<p>If she were not dumb, and could defend herself, her</p>\n<p>innocence would come to light.”</p>\n<p>But when the old woman stole away the newly-born child for the third</p>\n<p>time, and accused the Queen, who did not utter one word of defense, the</p>\n<p>King could do no otherwise than deliver her over to justice; and she</p>\n<p>was sentenced to be burned.</p>\n<p>When the day came for the sentence to be executed, it was the last day</p>\n",
        "<p>of the six years during which she was not to speak or laugh, and she</p>\n<p>had delivered her dear brothers from the power of the enchantment.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>six shirts were ready, only the left sleeve of the sixth was wanting.</p>\n<p>When, therefore, she was led to the stake, she laid the shirts on her</p>\n<p>arm.</p>\n<p>And when she stood on high and the fire was just going to be</p>\n",
        "<p>lighted, she looked around and six Swans came flying through the air</p>\n<p>toward her.</p>\n<p>Then she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart</p>\n<p>leapt with joy.</p>\n<p>The Swans swept toward her and sank down so that she could throw the</p>\n<p>shirts over them.</p>\n<p>And as they were touched by them, their swan’s skins</p>\n",
        "<p>fell off, and her brothers stood in their own form before her, vigorous</p>\n<p>and handsome.</p>\n<p>The youngest lacked only his left arm, and had in its</p>\n<p>place a swan’s wing on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>They embraced and kissed each other, and the Queen went to the King,</p>\n<p>who was greatly moved, and she began to speak, and said, “Dearest</p>\n<p>Husband, now I may speak and declare to you that I am innocent, and</p>\n",
        "<p>falsely accused.” And she told him of the treachery of the old woman</p>\n<p>who had taken away her three children, and hidden them.</p>\n<p>To the great joy of the King, they were brought back.</p>\n<p>And as a</p>\n<p>punishment, the wicked woman was bound to the stake and burned to ashes.</p>\n<p>But the King and the Queen, with their six brothers, lived many years</p>\n<p>in happiness and peace.</p>\n",
        "<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE POOR MILLER’S BOY AND THE CAT</h3>\n<p>In a certain mill, lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child.</p>\n<p>Three apprentices served under him.</p>\n<p>As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, “I</p>\n<p>am old, and want to sit in the chimney-corner.</p>\n<p>Go out, and whichsoever</p>\n",
        "<p>of you brings me the best horse, to him will I give the mill.</p>\n<p>And in</p>\n<p>return for it, he shall take care of me till my death.”</p>\n<p>The third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as</p>\n<p>foolish by the others.</p>\n<p>They begrudged the mill to him, and afterward he</p>\n<p>would not have it.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village,</p>\n<p>the two said to stupid Hans, “You may just as well stay here; as long</p>\n<p>as you live you will never get a horse.”</p>\n<p>Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a</p>\n<p>cave in which they lay down to sleep.</p>\n<p>The two sharp ones waited until</p>\n<p>Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him</p>\n",
        "<p>where he was.</p>\n<p>They thought they had done a very clever thing, but it</p>\n<p>was certain to turn out ill for them.</p>\n<p>When the sun arose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>looked around on every side and exclaimed, “Oh, alas!</p>\n<p>where am I?”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, into the forest, thinking:</p>\n<p>“Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?”</p>\n<p>Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small Tabby-Cat</p>\n<p>which said quite kindly, “Hans, where are you going?”</p>\n<p>“Alas, you cannot help me.”</p>\n<p>“I well know your desire,” said the Cat.</p>\n<p>“You wish to have a beautiful</p>\n",
        "<p>horse.</p>\n<p>Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years, and</p>\n<p>then I will give you a horse more beautiful than any you have ever seen</p>\n<p>in your whole life.”</p>\n<p>“Well, this is a wonderful Cat!” thought Hans, “but I am determined to</p>\n<p>see if she is telling the truth.”</p>\n<p>So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were</p>\n",
        "<p>nothing but cats who were her servants.</p>\n<p>They leapt nimbly upstairs and</p>\n<p>downstairs, and were merry and happy.</p>\n<p>In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make</p>\n<p>music.</p>\n<p>One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put</p>\n<p>the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly</p>\n",
        "<p>could.</p>\n<p>When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the Cat said,</p>\n<p>“Now, Hans, come and dance with me.”</p>\n<p>“No,” said he, “I won’t dance with a pussy cat.</p>\n<p>I have never done that</p>\n<p>yet.”</p>\n<p>“Then take him to bed,” said she to the cats.</p>\n",
        "<p>So one of them lighted him to his bedroom, one pulled his shoes off,</p>\n<p>one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle.</p>\n<p>Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his</p>\n<p>stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one</p>\n<p>washed him, and one dried his face with her tail.</p>\n<p>“That feels very soft!” said Hans.</p>\n<p>He, however, had to serve the Cat, and chop some wood every day.</p>\n",
        "<p>And</p>\n<p>to do that, he had an axe of silver, while the wedge and saw were of</p>\n<p>silver and the mallet of copper.</p>\n<p>So he chopped the wood small.</p>\n<p>He stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw</p>\n<p>any one but the Tabby-Cat and her servants.</p>\n<p>Once she said to him, “Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass,” and</p>\n",
        "<p>gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him</p>\n<p>deliver them up again carefully.</p>\n<p>So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and when he had</p>\n<p>finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the</p>\n<p>house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give him his reward.</p>\n<p>“No,” said the Cat, “you must first do something more for me of the</p>\n<p>same kind.</p>\n",
        "<p>There is timber of silver, carpenter’s axe, square, and</p>\n<p>everything that is needful, all of silver, with these build me a small</p>\n<p>house.”</p>\n<p>Then Hans built the small house, and said that he had now done</p>\n<p>everything, and still he had no horse.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six</p>\n<p>months.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Cat asked him if he would like to see her horses?</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Hans.</p>\n<p>Then she opened the door of the small house.</p>\n<p>And when she had opened</p>\n<p>it, there stood twelve horses,--such horses, so bright and shining,</p>\n<p>that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them.</p>\n<p>And now she gave him to eat and to drink, and said, “Go home.</p>\n",
        "<p>I will</p>\n<p>not give you your horse to take away with you.</p>\n<p>But in three days’ time,</p>\n<p>I will follow you and bring it.”</p>\n<p>So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill.</p>\n<p>She had,</p>\n<p>however, never once given him a new coat, and he had been obliged to</p>\n",
        "<p>keep on his dirty old smock-frock, which he had brought with him, and</p>\n<p>which during the seven years had everywhere become too small for him.</p>\n<p>When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again, and</p>\n<p>each of them certainly had brought a horse with him.</p>\n<p>But one of them</p>\n<p>was blind and the other lame.</p>\n<p>They asked Hans where his horse was.</p>\n",
        "<p>“It will follow me in three days’ time.”</p>\n<p>Then they laughed and said, “Indeed, stupid Hans!</p>\n<p>where will you get a</p>\n<p>horse?</p>\n<p>It will be a fine one!”</p>\n<p>Hans went into the parlor, but the miller said he should not sit down</p>\n<p>to table for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed</p>\n",
        "<p>of him if any one came in.</p>\n<p>So they gave him a mouthful of food outside.</p>\n<p>At night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have</p>\n<p>a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie</p>\n<p>down on a little hard straw.</p>\n<p>In the morning, when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach</p>\n<p>came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to</p>\n",
        "<p>see them!--and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the</p>\n<p>poor miller’s boy.</p>\n<p>And a magnificent Princess alighted from the coach, and went into the</p>\n<p>mill.</p>\n<p>And this Princess was the little Tabby-Cat whom poor Hans had</p>\n<p>served for seven years.</p>\n<p>She asked the miller where the miller’s boy and drudge was.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the miller said, “We will not have him here in the mill, he is so</p>\n<p>ragged.</p>\n<p>He is lying in the goose-house.”</p>\n<p>Then the King’s Daughter said that they were to fetch him immediately.</p>\n<p>So they brought him; and he had to hold his little smock together to</p>\n<p>cover himself.</p>\n<p>Her servants unpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed</p>\n",
        "<p>him.</p>\n<p>And when it was done, no King could have looked more handsome.</p>\n<p>Then the Princess desired to see the horses, which the other</p>\n<p>apprentices had brought home with them.</p>\n<p>One of them was blind and the</p>\n<p>other lame.</p>\n<p>So she ordered her servants to bring the seventh horse.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the miller saw it, he said such a horse as that had never before</p>\n<p>entered his yard.</p>\n<p>“And that is for the third miller’s boy,” said she.</p>\n<p>“Then he must have the mill,” said the miller.</p>\n<p>But the Princess said that the horse was for himself, and that he was</p>\n<p>to keep his mill as well.</p>\n<p>Then she took her faithful Hans, set him in</p>\n",
        "<p>the coach, and drove away with him.</p>\n<p>They first drove to the little house, which he had built with the</p>\n<p>silver tools.</p>\n<p>Behold!</p>\n<p>it was a great castle!</p>\n<p>Everything inside it was</p>\n<p>of silver and gold!</p>\n",
        "<p>Then she married him; and he was rich, so rich that he had enough for</p>\n<p>all the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>After this, let no one say that any one who is silly can never become a</p>\n<p>person of importance.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>LITTLE RED-CAP</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl, who was loved by every</p>\n",
        "<p>one who looked at her, and most of all by her Grandmother.</p>\n<p>There was</p>\n<p>nothing that she would not have given the child!</p>\n<p>Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well</p>\n<p>that she would not wear anything else.</p>\n<p>So she was always called Little</p>\n<p>Red-Cap.</p>\n",
        "<p>One day, her Mother said to her, “Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece</p>\n<p>of cake and a bottle of wine.</p>\n<p>Take them to your Grandmother.</p>\n<p>She is ill</p>\n<p>and weak, and they will do her good.</p>\n<p>Set out before it gets hot.</p>\n<p>Walk</p>\n",
        "<p>nicely and quietly.</p>\n<p>Do not run off the path, or you may fall and break</p>\n<p>the bottle; then your Grandmother will get nothing!</p>\n<p>When you go into</p>\n<p>her room, don’t forget to say ‘Good morning,’ and don’t stop to peep</p>\n<p>into every corner, before you do it.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll take great care,” said Little Red-Cap to her Mother, and gave her</p>\n",
        "<p>hand on it.</p>\n<p>The Grandmother lived in the wood, half an hour’s distance from the</p>\n<p>village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a Wolf met her.</p>\n<p>Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all</p>\n<p>afraid of him.</p>\n<p>“Good-day, Little Red-Cap,” said he.</p>\n<p>“Thank you kindly, Wolf.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?”</p>\n<p>“To my Grandmother’s.”</p>\n<p>“What have you got in your apron?”</p>\n<p>“Cake and wine.</p>\n<p>Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick Grandmother is</p>\n<p>to have something good, to make her stronger.”</p>\n<p>“Where does your Grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“A good quarter of an hour farther on in the wood.</p>\n<p>Her house stands</p>\n<p>under the three large oak-trees; the nut-trees are just below.</p>\n<p>You</p>\n<p>surely must know it,” replied Little Red-Cap.</p>\n<p>The Wolf thought to himself, “What a tender young creature!</p>\n<p>what a nice</p>\n",
        "<p>plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.</p>\n<p>I must</p>\n<p>act craftily, so as to catch both.”</p>\n<p>He walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he</p>\n<p>said, “See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why</p>\n<p>do you not look round?</p>\n<p>I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly</p>\n",
        "<p>the little birds are singing.</p>\n<p>You walk gravely along as if you were</p>\n<p>going to school, while everything else in the wood is merry.”</p>\n<p>Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams</p>\n<p>dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing</p>\n<p>everywhere, she thought, “Suppose I take Grandmother a fresh nosegay.</p>\n<p>That would please her too.</p>\n",
        "<p>It is so early in the day that I shall still</p>\n<p>get there in good time.”</p>\n<p>And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier</p>\n<p>one farther on, and ran after it, and thus got deeper and deeper into</p>\n<p>the wood.</p>\n",
        "<p>Meanwhile, the Wolf ran straight to the Grandmother’s house and knocked</p>\n<p>at the door.</p>\n<p>“Who is there?”</p>\n<p>“Little Red-Cap,” replied the Wolf.</p>\n<p>“She is bringing cake and wine.</p>\n<p>Open the door.”</p>\n<p>“Lift the latch,” called out the Grandmother, “I am too weak, and</p>\n",
        "<p>cannot get up.”</p>\n<p>The Wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a</p>\n<p>word he went straight to the Grandmother’s bed, and devoured her.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed,</p>\n<p>and drew the curtains.</p>\n<p>Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers.</p>\n",
        "<p>When</p>\n<p>she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered</p>\n<p>her Grandmother, and set out on the way to her.</p>\n<p>She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open.</p>\n<p>And when she</p>\n<p>went into the room, she had such a strange feeling, that she said to</p>\n<p>herself, “Oh dear!</p>\n",
        "<p>how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like</p>\n<p>being with Grandmother so much.”</p>\n<p>She called out, “Good morning,” but received no answer.</p>\n<p>So she went to</p>\n<p>the bed and drew back the curtains.</p>\n<p>There lay her Grandmother with her</p>\n<p>cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>Grandmother,” she said, “what big ears you have!”</p>\n<p>“The better to hear you with, my Child,” was the reply.</p>\n<p>“But, Grandmother, what big eyes you have!” she said.</p>\n<p>“The better to see you with, my dear.”</p>\n<p>“But, Grandmother, what large hands you have!”</p>\n<p>“The better to hug you with.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh!</p>\n<p>but Grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!”</p>\n<p>“The better to eat you with!” And scarcely had the Wolf said this, than</p>\n<p>with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.</p>\n<p>When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,</p>\n<p>fell asleep and began to snore very loud.</p>\n<p>The huntsman was just passing</p>\n",
        "<p>the house, and thought to himself, “How the old woman is snoring!</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>must just see if she wants anything.”</p>\n<p>So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw the Wolf</p>\n<p>lying in it.</p>\n<p>“Do I find thee here, thou old sinner!” said he.</p>\n<p>“I have</p>\n",
        "<p>long sought thee!”</p>\n<p>Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the</p>\n<p>Wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be</p>\n<p>saved.</p>\n<p>So he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to</p>\n<p>cut open the stomach of the sleeping Wolf.</p>\n<p>When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then</p>\n",
        "<p>he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, “Ah,</p>\n<p>how frightened I have been!</p>\n<p>How dark it was inside the Wolf!”</p>\n<p>And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely</p>\n<p>able to breathe.</p>\n<p>Red-Cap then quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the</p>\n<p>Wolf’s body.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones</p>\n<p>were so heavy that he tumbled down at once, and fell dead.</p>\n<p>Then all three were delighted.</p>\n<p>The huntsman drew off the Wolf’s skin</p>\n<p>and went home with it.</p>\n<p>The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine</p>\n<p>which Red-Cap had brought, and grew strong again.</p>\n",
        "<p>But Red-Cap thought to herself, “As long as I live, I will never leave</p>\n<p>the path to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do</p>\n<p>so.”</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>KING THRUSHBEARD</h3>\n<p>A King had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure, but so</p>\n<p>proud and haughty withal that no suitor was good enough for her.</p>\n",
        "<p>She</p>\n<p>sent away one after the other, and made fun of them as well.</p>\n<p>Once the King gave a great feast and invited thereto, from far and</p>\n<p>near, all the young men likely to marry.</p>\n<p>They were marshalled in a row</p>\n<p>according to their rank and standing.</p>\n<p>First came the Kings, then the</p>\n",

        "<p>pale, “As pale as death.” The fifth too red, “A fighting-cock.” The</p>\n<p>sixth was not straight enough, “A green log dried behind the stove.”</p>\n<p>So she had something to say against every one.</p>\n<p>But she made herself</p>\n<p>especially merry over a good King, who stood quite high up in the row,</p>\n<p>and whose chin had grown a little crooked.</p>\n<p>“Well,” she cried and</p>\n",
        "<p>laughed, “he has a chin like a thrush’s beak!” and from that time he</p>\n<p>got the name of King Thrushbeard.</p>\n<p>But the old King, when he saw that his daughter did nothing but mock</p>\n<p>people, and despised all the suitors who were gathered there, was very</p>\n<p>angry, and swore that she should have for her husband the very first</p>\n<p>beggar that came to his doors.</p>\n<p>A few days afterward, a fiddler came and sang beneath the windows,</p>\n",
        "<p>trying to earn a small alms.</p>\n<p>When the King heard him, he said, “Let him</p>\n<p>come up.”</p>\n<p>So the fiddler came up, in his dirty, ragged clothes, and sang before</p>\n<p>the King and his daughter.</p>\n<p>When he had ended he asked for a trifling</p>\n<p>gift.</p>\n",
        "<p>The King said, “Your song has pleased me so well that I will give you</p>\n<p>my daughter there, to wife.”</p>\n<p>The King’s Daughter shuddered, but the King said, “I have taken an oath</p>\n<p>to give you to the very first beggar man, and I will keep it.”</p>\n<p>All she could say was in vain; the priest was brought, and she had to</p>\n<p>let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the spot.</p>\n<p>When that was done the King said, “Now it is not proper for you, a</p>\n",

        "<p>She had to stoop in order to go in at the low door.</p>\n<p>“Where are the</p>\n<p>servants?” said the King’s Daughter.</p>\n<p>“What servants?” answered the beggar man.</p>\n<p>“You must do what you wish</p>\n<p>to have done.</p>\n<p>Just make a fire at once, and set on water to cook my</p>\n",

        "<p>Then she began to</p>\n<p>weave, but the tough willows wounded her delicate hands.</p>\n<p>“I see that this will not do,” said the man; “you had better spin;</p>\n<p>perhaps you can do that.”</p>\n<p>She sat down and tried to spin, but the hard thread soon cut her soft</p>\n<p>fingers so that the blood ran down.</p>\n<p>“See,” said the man, “you are fit for no sort of work.</p>\n",

        "<p>and casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold.</p>\n<p>As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak</p>\n<p>and said, “Hark you, Fisherman, if you will throw me back again into</p>\n<p>the water, I will change your little hut into a splendid castle.”</p>\n<p>Then the fisherman answered, “Of what use is a castle to me, if I have</p>\n<p>nothing to eat?”</p>\n<p>The Gold Fish continued, “That shall be taken care of.</p>\n",
        "<p>There will be a</p>\n<p>cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of</p>\n<p>the most delicate meats, and as many of them as you may desire.”</p>\n<p>“If that be true,” said the man, “then I can well do you a favor.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the Fish, “there is, however, the condition that you shall</p>\n<p>tell no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck</p>\n<p>has come.</p>\n",
        "<p>If you speak but one single word, all will be over.”</p>\n<p>Then the man threw the wonderful Fish back again into the water, and</p>\n<p>went home.</p>\n<p>Where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle.</p>\n<p>He opened</p>\n<p>wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes,</p>\n<p>sitting in a splendid room.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was quite delighted, and said, “Husband, how has all this come to</p>\n<p>pass?</p>\n<p>It suits me very well.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said the man, “it suits me too.</p>\n<p>But I am frightfully hungry,</p>\n<p>just give me something to eat.”</p>\n<p>Said the wife, “But I have got nothing and don’t know where to find</p>\n",
        "<p>anything in this new house.”</p>\n<p>“There is no need of your knowing,” said the man, “for I see yonder a</p>\n<p>great cupboard, just unlock it.”</p>\n<p>When she opened it, lo!</p>\n<p>there stood cakes, meat, fruit, wine.</p>\n<p>Then the woman cried joyfully, “What more can you want, my dear?” and</p>\n<p>they sat down, and ate and drank together.</p>\n",
        "<p>When they had had enough, the woman said, “But, Husband, whence come</p>\n<p>all these riches?”</p>\n<p>“Alas,” answered he, “do not question me about it, for I dare not tell</p>\n<p>you anything.</p>\n<p>If I disclose it to any one, then all our good fortune</p>\n<p>will fly.”</p>\n<p>“Very good,” said she, “if I am not to know anything, then I do not</p>\n",
        "<p>want to know anything.”</p>\n<p>However, she was not in earnest.</p>\n<p>She never rested day or night, and she</p>\n<p>goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was</p>\n<p>owing to a wonderful Gold Fish which he had caught, and to which in</p>\n<p>return he had given its liberty.</p>\n<p>And as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the</p>\n",
        "<p>cupboard immediately disappeared.</p>\n<p>They were once more in the old</p>\n<p>fisherman’s hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and</p>\n<p>fish.</p>\n<p>But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the Gold Fish.</p>\n<p>“Listen,” said the Fish, “if you will throw me back into the water</p>\n<p>again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of</p>\n",
        "<p>roast and boiled meats.</p>\n<p>Only be firm; for your life’s sake don’t reveal</p>\n<p>from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again!”</p>\n<p>“I will take good care,” answered the fisherman, and threw the fish</p>\n<p>back into the water.</p>\n<p>Now at home, everything was once more in its former magnificence.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n",
        "<p>wife was overjoyed at their good fortune.</p>\n<p>But curiosity left her no</p>\n<p>peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had</p>\n<p>come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it.</p>\n<p>The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so</p>\n<p>angry that he broke out and betrayed the secret.</p>\n<p>In an instant the</p>\n",
        "<p>castle disappeared, and they were back again in their old hut.</p>\n<p>“Now you have got what you want,” said he; “and we can gnaw at a bare</p>\n<p>bone again.”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” said the woman, “I had rather have no riches; if I am not to know</p>\n<p>from whom they come, then I have no peace.”</p>\n<p>The man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out the</p>\n<p>Gold Fish for a third time.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Listen,” said the Fish, “I see very well that I am fated to fall into</p>\n<p>your hands.</p>\n<p>Take me home and cut me into six pieces.</p>\n<p>Give your wife two</p>\n<p>of them to eat, two to your horse, and bury two of them in the ground.</p>\n<p>Then they will bring you a blessing.”</p>\n<p>The fisherman took the Fish home with him, and did as it had bidden him.</p>\n",
        "<p>It came to pass that from the two pieces that were buried in the</p>\n<p>ground, two Golden Lilies sprang up; that the horse had two Golden</p>\n<p>Foals; and the fisherman’s wife bore two children who were made</p>\n<p>entirely of gold.</p>\n<p>The children grew up, became tall and handsome, and the lilies and</p>\n<p>horses grew likewise.</p>\n<p>Then the lads said, “Father, we want to mount our Golden Steeds and</p>\n",
        "<p>travel out in the world.”</p>\n<p>But he answered sorrowfully, “How shall I bear it, if you go away and I</p>\n<p>know not how it fares with you?”</p>\n<p>Then they said, “The two Golden Lilies remain here.</p>\n<p>By them you may see</p>\n<p>how it is with us.</p>\n<p>If they are fresh, then we are in health.</p>\n",
        "<p>If they</p>\n<p>are withered, we are ill.</p>\n<p>If they perish, then we are dead.”</p>\n<p>So they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>perceived the Gold-Children and began to laugh, and jeer.</p>\n<p>When one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go out</p>\n",
        "<p>into the world, but turned back and went home again to his father.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>the other rode forward and reached a great forest.</p>\n<p>[Illustration: THE MAIDEN SAID, “I WILL BE TRUE TO YOU, YOUR LIFE LONG”]</p>\n<p>As he was about to enter it, the people said, “It is not safe for</p>\n<p>you to ride through; the wood is full of robbers, who would treat you</p>\n<p>badly.</p>\n",
        "<p>You will fare ill.</p>\n<p>When they see that you are all of gold and</p>\n<p>your horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.”</p>\n<p>But he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said, “I must and</p>\n<p>will ride through it.”</p>\n<p>Then he took bear-skins and covered himself and his horse with them, so</p>\n<p>that the gold was not seen, and rode fearlessly into the forest.</p>\n",
        "<p>When</p>\n<p>he had ridden onward a little, he heard a rustling in the bushes, and</p>\n<p>heard voices speaking together.</p>\n<p>From one side came cries of, “There is one!” but from the other, “Let</p>\n<p>him go!</p>\n<p>’tis an idle fellow, as poor and bare as a church-mouse.</p>\n<p>What</p>\n",
        "<p>should we gain from him?”</p>\n<p>So the Gold-Child rode joyfully through the forest, and no evil befell</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>One day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so</p>\n<p>beautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she</p>\n<p>existed in the world.</p>\n<p>And as such a mighty love took possession of him, he went up to her and</p>\n",
        "<p>said, “I love you with my whole heart.</p>\n<p>Will you be my wife?”</p>\n<p>He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed and said, “Yes, I</p>\n<p>will be your wife, and be true to you your whole life long.”</p>\n<p>They were married.</p>\n<p>Then just as they were in the greatest happiness,</p>\n<p>home came the father of the Bride.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he saw that his daughter’s</p>\n<p>wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and said, “Where is</p>\n<p>the Bridegroom?”</p>\n<p>They showed him the Gold-Child, who, however, still wore his bear-skins.</p>\n<p>Then the father said wrathfully, “A vagabond shall never have my</p>\n<p>daughter!” and was about to kill him.</p>\n<p>Then the Bride begged as hard as she could, and said, “He is my</p>\n",
        "<p>husband, and I love him with all my heart!” until at last he allowed</p>\n<p>himself to be appeased.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts, so that next morning he</p>\n<p>rose early, wishing to see whether his daughter’s husband was a common</p>\n<p>ragged beggar.</p>\n<p>But when he peeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man</p>\n<p>in the bed, and the cast-off bear-skins lying on the ground.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he went back, and thought, “What a good thing it was that I</p>\n<p>restrained my anger!</p>\n<p>I should have committed a great crime.”</p>\n<p>But the Gold-Child dreamed that he rode out to the chase of a splendid</p>\n<p>stag, and when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife, “I must go</p>\n<p>out hunting.”</p>\n<p>She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said, “You might</p>\n",
        "<p>easily meet with a great misfortune.”</p>\n<p>But he answered, “I must and will go.”</p>\n<p>Thereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest.</p>\n<p>It was not long</p>\n<p>before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his dream.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away.</p>\n",
        "<p>He gave chase</p>\n<p>over hedges and ditches for the whole day without feeling tired.</p>\n<p>In</p>\n<p>the evening the stag vanished from his sight, and when the Gold-Child</p>\n<p>looked round him, he was standing before a little house, wherein was a</p>\n<p>Witch.</p>\n<p>He knocked, and a little old woman came out and asked, “What are you</p>\n",
        "<p>doing so late in the midst of the great forest?”</p>\n<p>“Have you not seen a stag?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” answered she, “I know the stag well,” and thereupon a little dog</p>\n<p>which had come out of the house with her, barked at the man violently.</p>\n<p>“Will you be silent, you odious toad,” said he, “or I will shoot you</p>\n<p>dead.”</p>\n<p>Then the Witch cried out in a passion, “What!</p>\n",
        "<p>will you slay my little</p>\n<p>dog?” and immediately she transformed him, so that he lay like a stone.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile his Bride awaited him in vain, and thought, “That which I so</p>\n<p>greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my heart, has come upon him!”</p>\n<p>But at home, the other brother was standing by the Gold-Lilies, when</p>\n<p>one of them suddenly drooped.</p>\n<p>“Alas!” said he, “my brother has met with</p>\n",
        "<p>some great misfortune!</p>\n<p>I must away to see if I can possibly rescue him.”</p>\n<p>Then he mounted his Golden Horse, and rode forth and entered the great</p>\n<p>forest, where his brother lay turned to stone.</p>\n<p>The old Witch came out</p>\n<p>of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also.</p>\n<p>He did not go near her, but said, “I will shoot you, if you do not</p>\n",
        "<p>bring my brother to life again.”</p>\n<p>She touched the stone, though very unwillingly, with her forefinger.</p>\n<p>Then he was immediately restored to his human shape.</p>\n<p>The two Gold-Children rejoiced, when they saw each other again.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>kissed and caressed each other, and rode away together out of the</p>\n<p>forest, the one home to his Bride, the other to his father.</p>\n",
        "<p>The father then said, “I knew well that you had rescued your brother,</p>\n<p>for the Golden Lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again.”</p>\n<p>Then they lived happily, and all prospered with them until their death.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>LITTLE SNOW-WHITE</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were</p>\n<p>falling like feathers from the sky, a Queen sat at a window sewing, and</p>\n",
        "<p>the frame of the window was made of black ebony.</p>\n<p>And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow,</p>\n<p>she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell</p>\n<p>upon the snow.</p>\n<p>And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she</p>\n<p>thought to herself, “Would that I had a child as white as snow, as red</p>\n<p>as blood, and as black as the wood of the window-frame.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow,</p>\n<p>and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.</p>\n<p>She was</p>\n<p>therefore called little Snow-White.</p>\n<p>And when the child was born, the</p>\n<p>Queen died.</p>\n<p>After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife.</p>\n",
        "<p>She</p>\n<p>was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear</p>\n<p>that any one else should surpass her in beauty.</p>\n<p>She had a wonderful</p>\n<p>looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself</p>\n<p>in it, and said:</p>\n<p>“_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,</p>\n",
        "<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”</p>\n<p>the Looking-Glass answered:</p>\n<p>“_Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all!_”</p>\n<p>Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the Looking-Glass spoke the</p>\n<p>truth.</p>\n<p>But little Snow-White was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful.</p>\n<p>When she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more</p>\n",
        "<p>beautiful than the Queen herself.</p>\n<p>And once when the Queen asked her</p>\n<p>Looking-Glass:</p>\n<p>“_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,</p>\n<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”</p>\n<p>it answered:</p>\n<p>“_Thou art fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen.</p>\n",
        "<p>But more beautiful still is Snow-White, I ween._”</p>\n<p>Then the Queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy.</p>\n<p>From</p>\n<p>that hour, whenever she looked at little Snow-White, her heart heaved</p>\n<p>in her breast, she hated the maiden so much.</p>\n<p>And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so</p>\n<p>that she had no peace day or night.</p>\n",
        "<p>She called a huntsman, and said,</p>\n<p>“Take the child away into the forest.</p>\n<p>I will no longer have her in my</p>\n<p>sight.</p>\n<p>Kill her.”</p>\n<p>The huntsman obeyed, and took her away.</p>\n<p>But when he had drawn his</p>\n",

        "<p>rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>But now, the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so</p>\n<p>terrified that she looked at every leaf of every tree, and did not</p>\n<p>know what to do.</p>\n<p>Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and</p>\n<p>through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm.</p>\n",
        "<p>She ran as long as her feet would go, until it was almost evening.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself.</p>\n<p>Everything</p>\n<p>in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told.</p>\n<p>There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates,</p>\n<p>and on each plate a little spoon.</p>\n",
        "<p>Moreover, there were seven little</p>\n<p>knives and forks, and seven little mugs.</p>\n<p>Against the wall stood seven</p>\n<p>little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes.</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White was so hungry and thirsty, that she ate some</p>\n<p>vegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of</p>\n<p>each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then, as she</p>\n<p>was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none</p>\n<p>of them suited her.</p>\n<p>One was too long, another too short, but at last</p>\n<p>she found that the seventh one was right, so she remained in it, said a</p>\n<p>prayer and went to sleep.</p>\n<p>When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were</p>\n<p>seven Dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore.</p>\n<p>They lit</p>\n<p>their seven candles, and, as it was now light within the cottage, they</p>\n<p>saw that some one had been there, for everything was not in the same</p>\n<p>order in which they had left it.</p>\n<p>The first said, “Who has been sitting on my chair?”</p>\n",
        "<p>The second, “Who has been eating off my plate?”</p>\n<p>The third, “Who has been taking some of my bread?”</p>\n<p>The fourth, “Who has been eating my vegetables?”</p>\n<p>The fifth, “Who has been using my fork?”</p>\n<p>The sixth, “Who has been cutting with my knife?”</p>\n<p>The seventh, “Who has been drinking out of my mug?”</p>\n<p>Then the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his</p>\n",
        "<p>bed, and he said, “Who has been getting into my bed?”</p>\n<p>The others came up and each called out, “Somebody has been lying in my</p>\n<p>bed too.”</p>\n<p>But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little Snow-White, who</p>\n<p>was lying fast asleep therein.</p>\n<p>And he called the others, who came</p>\n<p>running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and brought their</p>\n",
        "<p>seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snow-White.</p>\n<p>“Oh, oh!” cried they, “what a lovely child!” and they were so glad that</p>\n<p>they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed.</p>\n<p>And the</p>\n<p>seventh Dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got</p>\n<p>through the night.</p>\n<p>The next morning, little Snow-White awoke, and was frightened when she</p>\n",
        "<p>saw the seven Dwarfs.</p>\n<p>But they were friendly and asked her what her</p>\n<p>name was.</p>\n<p>“My name is little Snow-White,” she answered.</p>\n<p>“How have you come to our house?” said the Dwarfs.</p>\n<p>Then she told them that the wicked Queen had wished to have her</p>\n<p>killed, but that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run</p>\n",
        "<p>for the whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.</p>\n<p>The Dwarfs said, “If you will take care of our house, cook, make the</p>\n<p>beds, wash, sew, and knit, and if you will keep everything neat and</p>\n<p>clean, you may stay with us and you shall want for nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said little Snow-White, “with all my heart,” and she stayed with</p>\n<p>them.</p>\n<p>She kept the house in order for them.</p>\n",
        "<p>In the mornings they went to the</p>\n<p>mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the evenings they came</p>\n<p>back, and then their supper had to be ready.</p>\n<p>The maiden was alone the whole day, so the good Dwarfs warned her and</p>\n<p>said, “Beware of the Queen, she will soon know that you are here.</p>\n<p>Be</p>\n<p>sure to let no one come in.”</p>\n",
        "<p>But the Queen, believing that little Snow-White was dead, could not but</p>\n<p>think that she herself was again the first and most beautiful of all.</p>\n<p>She went to her Looking-Glass, and said:</p>\n<p>“_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,</p>\n<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”</p>\n<p>and the Glass answered:</p>\n<p>“_Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,</p>\n",
        "<p>But over the hills, where the Seven Dwarfs dwell,</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White is alive and well,</p>\n<p>And none is so fair as she._”</p>\n<p>Then she was astounded, for she knew that the Looking-Glass never spoke</p>\n<p>falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her, for that</p>\n<p>little Snow-White was still alive.</p>\n<p>And so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so</p>\n",
        "<p>long as she herself was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let her</p>\n<p>have no rest.</p>\n<p>And when she had at last thought of something to do, she</p>\n<p>painted her face, and dressed herself like an old pedler-woman, and no</p>\n<p>one could have known her.</p>\n<p>In this disguise she went over the Seven Mountains to the Seven Dwarfs,</p>\n<p>and knocked at the door and cried, “Pretty things to sell, very cheap,</p>\n",
        "<p>very cheap!”</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White looked out at the window, and called, “Good-day, my</p>\n<p>dear woman, what have you to sell?”</p>\n<p>“Good things, pretty things,” she answered; “stay-laces of all colors,”</p>\n<p>and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-colored silk.</p>\n<p>“I may let the worthy old woman in,” thought little Snow-White, and she</p>\n<p>unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Child,” said the old woman, “what a fright you look.</p>\n<p>Come, I will lace</p>\n<p>you properly for once.”</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let</p>\n<p>herself be laced with the new laces.</p>\n<p>But the old woman laced so quickly</p>\n<p>and laced so tightly that little Snow-White lost her breath and fell</p>\n",
        "<p>down as if dead.</p>\n<p>“Now I am the most beautiful,” said the Queen to herself, and ran away.</p>\n<p>Not long afterward, in the evening, the Seven Dwarfs came home.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>how shocked they were when they saw their dear little Snow-White lying</p>\n<p>on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor moved, and seemed to</p>\n<p>be dead.</p>\n",
        "<p>They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced too</p>\n<p>tightly, they cut the laces.</p>\n<p>Than she began to breathe a little, and</p>\n<p>after a while came to life again.</p>\n<p>When the Dwarfs heard what had happened, they said, “The old</p>\n<p>pedler-woman was no one else than the wicked Queen.</p>\n<p>Take care and let</p>\n",
        "<p>no one come in when we are not with you.”</p>\n<p>But the wicked woman, when she had reached home, went in front of the</p>\n<p>Glass and asked:</p>\n<p>“_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,</p>\n<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”</p>\n<p>and it answered as before:</p>\n<p>“_Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,</p>\n",
        "<p>But over the hills, where the Seven Dwarfs dwell,</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White is alive and well,</p>\n<p>And none is so fair as she._”</p>\n<p>When she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for</p>\n<p>she saw plainly that little Snow-White was again alive.</p>\n<p>“But now,” she</p>\n<p>said, “I will think of something that shall put an end to you,” and by</p>\n",
        "<p>the help of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisonous comb.</p>\n<p>Then she disguised herself, and took the shape of another old woman.</p>\n<p>So</p>\n<p>she went over the Seven Mountains to the Seven Dwarfs, knocked at the</p>\n<p>door, and cried, “Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!”</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White looked out, and said, “Go away.</p>\n<p>I cannot let any one</p>\n",
        "<p>come in.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose you may look,” said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous</p>\n<p>comb out and held it up.</p>\n<p>It pleased the maiden so well that she let herself be beguiled, and</p>\n<p>opened the door.</p>\n<p>When they had made a bargain, the old woman said, “Now</p>\n<p>I will comb you properly for once.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Poor little Snow-White had no suspicion, and let the Old Woman do as</p>\n<p>she pleased.</p>\n<p>But hardly had she put the comb in her hair, then the</p>\n<p>poison in it took effect, and the maiden fell down senseless.</p>\n<p>“You paragon of beauty,” said the wicked woman, “you are done for now!”</p>\n<p>and she went away.</p>\n<p>But fortunately it was almost evening, and the Seven Dwarfs came home.</p>\n",
        "<p>When they saw little Snow-White lying as if dead upon the ground, they</p>\n<p>at once suspected the Queen.</p>\n<p>They looked and found the poisoned comb.</p>\n<p>Scarcely had they taken it out, when little Snow-White came to herself,</p>\n<p>and told them what had happened.</p>\n<p>Then they warned her once more to be</p>\n<p>upon her guard, and to open the door to no one.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Queen, at home, went in front of the Glass and said:</p>\n<p>“_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,</p>\n<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”</p>\n<p>then it answered as before:</p>\n<p>“_Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,</p>\n<p>But over the hills, where the Seven Dwarfs dwell,</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White is alive and well,</p>\n",
        "<p>And none is so fair as she._”</p>\n<p>When she heard the Glass speak thus, she trembled and shook with rage.</p>\n<p>“Little Snow-White shall die,” she cried, “even if it costs me my life!”</p>\n<p>Thereupon she went into a secret, lonely room, where no one ever came,</p>\n<p>and there she made a very poisonous apple.</p>\n<p>Outside it looked pretty,</p>\n<p>white with a red cheek, so that every one who saw it longed for it.</p>\n",
        "<p>But whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.</p>\n<p>When the apple was ready, she painted her face, and dressed herself as</p>\n<p>a countrywoman, and so she went over the Seven Mountains to the Seven</p>\n<p>Dwarfs.</p>\n<p>She knocked at the door.</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White put her head out of</p>\n<p>the window and said, “I cannot let any one in.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Seven Dwarfs have</p>\n<p>forbidden me.”</p>\n<p>“It is all the same to me,” answered the woman, “I shall soon get rid</p>\n<p>of my apples.</p>\n<p>There, I will give you one.”</p>\n<p>“No,” said little Snow-White, “I dare not take anything.”</p>\n<p>“Are you afraid of poison?” said the old woman.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Look, I will cut the</p>\n<p>apple in two pieces.</p>\n<p>You eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.”</p>\n<p>The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned.</p>\n<p>Little Snow-White longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the</p>\n<p>woman ate part of it, she could resist no longer, and stretched out her</p>\n<p>hand and took the poisonous half.</p>\n",
        "<p>But hardly had she a bit of it in her</p>\n<p>mouth, than she fell down dead.</p>\n<p>Then the Queen looked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud,</p>\n<p>and said, “White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood!</p>\n<p>This time</p>\n<p>the Dwarfs cannot wake you up again!”</p>\n<p>And when she asked of the Looking-Glass at home:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,</p>\n<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”</p>\n<p>it answered at last:</p>\n<p>“_Oh, Queen, in this land thou art fairest of all._”</p>\n<p>Then her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can have</p>\n<p>rest.</p>\n<p>The Dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found little Snow-White</p>\n",
        "<p>lying upon the ground.</p>\n<p>She breathed no longer and was dead.</p>\n<p>They lifted</p>\n<p>her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous,</p>\n<p>unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it</p>\n<p>was all of no use.</p>\n<p>The poor child was dead, and remained dead.</p>\n",
        "<p>They</p>\n<p>laid her upon a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for</p>\n<p>her, and wept three days long.</p>\n<p>Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she was</p>\n<p>living, and still had her pretty red cheeks.</p>\n<p>They said, “We could not</p>\n<p>bury her in the dark ground,” and they had a transparent coffin of</p>\n",
        "<p>glass made, so that she might be seen from all sides.</p>\n<p>They laid her in</p>\n<p>it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a</p>\n<p>King’s Daughter.</p>\n<p>Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always</p>\n<p>stayed by it to watch it.</p>\n<p>And birds came too, and wept for little</p>\n",
        "<p>Snow-White; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.</p>\n<p>And now little Snow-White lay a long, long time in the coffin.</p>\n<p>She did</p>\n<p>not change, but looked as if she were asleep; for she was as white as</p>\n<p>snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.</p>\n<p>It happened, however, that a King’s Son came into the forest, and went</p>\n<p>to the Dwarfs’ house to spend the night.</p>\n",
        "<p>He saw the coffin on the</p>\n<p>mountain, and the beautiful little Snow-White within it, and read what</p>\n<p>was written upon it in golden letters.</p>\n<p>Then he said to the Dwarfs, “Let me have the coffin.</p>\n<p>I will give you</p>\n<p>whatever you want for it.”</p>\n<p>But the Dwarfs answered, “We will not part with it for all the gold in</p>\n",
        "<p>the world.”</p>\n<p>Then he said, “Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without</p>\n<p>seeing little Snow-White.</p>\n<p>I will honor and prize her as my dearest</p>\n<p>possession,” As he spoke in this way the good Dwarfs took pity upon</p>\n<p>him, and gave him the coffin.</p>\n<p>And now the King’s Son had it carried away by his servants on their</p>\n",
        "<p>shoulders.</p>\n<p>And it happened, that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and</p>\n<p>with the shock the poisonous piece of apple, which little Snow-White</p>\n<p>had bitten off, came out of her throat.</p>\n<p>And before long she opened her</p>\n<p>eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive.</p>\n<p>“Oh, where am I?” she cried.</p>\n",
        "<p>The King’s Son, full of joy, said, “You are with me,” and told her what</p>\n<p>had happened, and said, “I love you more than everything in the world.</p>\n<p>Come with me to my father’s palace, you shall be my wife.”</p>\n<p>And little Snow-White was willing, and went with him, and their wedding</p>\n<p>was held with great show and splendor.</p>\n<p>But the wicked Queen was also</p>\n<p>bidden to the feast.</p>\n",
        "<p>When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes,</p>\n<p>she went before the Looking-Glass, and said:</p>\n<p>“_Looking-Glass, Looking-Glass, on the wall,</p>\n<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?_”</p>\n<p>the Glass answered:</p>\n<p>“_Oh, Queen, of all here the fairest art thou,</p>\n<p>But the young Queen is fairer by far, I trow!_”</p>\n",

        "<h3>RUMPELSTILTSKIN</h3>\n<p>Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter.</p>\n<p>Now it happened that he had to speak to the King, and in order to make</p>\n<p>himself appear important he said to him, “I have a daughter who can</p>\n<p>spin straw into gold.”</p>\n<p>The King said to the miller, “That is an art which pleases me well.</p>\n<p>If your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to-morrow to my</p>\n",
        "<p>palace, and I will try what she can do.”</p>\n<p>And when the girl was brought to him, he took her into a room which was</p>\n<p>quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel, and said,</p>\n<p>“Now set to work.</p>\n<p>If by to-morrow morning early, you have not spun this</p>\n<p>straw into gold, you must die.”</p>\n<p>Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone.</p>\n",
        "<p>So</p>\n<p>there sat the poor miller’s daughter, and for her life could not tell</p>\n<p>what to do.</p>\n<p>She had no idea how straw could be spun into gold; and she</p>\n<p>grew more and more miserable, until at last she began to weep.</p>\n<p>But all at once the door opened, and in came a Little Man, and said,</p>\n<p>“Good evening, Mistress Miller.</p>\n",
        "<p>Why are you crying so?”</p>\n<p>“Alas!” answered the girl, “I have to spin straw into gold, and I do</p>\n<p>not know how to do it.”</p>\n<p>“What will you give me,” said the Little Man, “if I do it for you?”</p>\n<p>“My necklace,” said the girl.</p>\n<p>The Little Man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the wheel,</p>\n<p>and _whirr, whirr, whirr,_ three turns, and the reel was full.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he</p>\n<p>put another on, and _whirr, whirr, whirr,_ three times round, and the</p>\n<p>second was full too.</p>\n<p>And so it went on till the morning, when all the</p>\n<p>straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold.</p>\n<p>By daybreak, the King was there, and when he saw the gold, he was</p>\n<p>astonished and delighted, but his heart became only more greedy.</p>\n",
        "<p>He had</p>\n<p>the miller’s daughter taken into another room full of straw, which was</p>\n<p>much larger, and commanded her to spin that also in one night if she</p>\n<p>valued her life.</p>\n<p>The girl knew not how to help herself, and was crying, when the door</p>\n<p>again opened, and the Little Man appeared, and said, “What will you</p>\n<p>give me if I spin the straw into gold for you?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“The ring on my finger,” answered the girl.</p>\n<p>The Little Man took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and, by</p>\n<p>morning, had spun all the straw into glittering gold.</p>\n<p>The King rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had not</p>\n<p>gold enough.</p>\n<p>He had the miller’s daughter taken into a still larger</p>\n<p>room full of straw, and said, “You must spin this, too, in the course</p>\n",
        "<p>of this night.</p>\n<p>But if you succeed, you shall be my wife.” “Even if she</p>\n<p>be a miller’s daughter,” thought he, “I could not find a richer wife in</p>\n<p>the whole world.”</p>\n<p>When the girl was alone the Little Man came again for the third time,</p>\n<p>and said, “What will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time</p>\n<p>also?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“I have nothing left that I could give,” answered the girl.</p>\n<p>“Then promise me, if you should become Queen, your first child.”</p>\n<p>“Who knows whether that will ever happen?” thought the miller’s</p>\n<p>daughter.</p>\n<p>And, not knowing how else to help herself in this difficulty,</p>\n<p>she promised the Little Man what he wanted.</p>\n<p>And for that he once more</p>\n",
        "<p>span the straw into gold.</p>\n<p>And when the King came in the morning, and found all as he had wished,</p>\n<p>he took her in marriage.</p>\n<p>And the pretty miller’s daughter became a</p>\n<p>Queen.</p>\n<p>A year after, she had a beautiful child, and she never gave a thought</p>\n<p>to the Little Man.</p>\n",
        "<p>But suddenly he came into her room, and said, “Now</p>\n<p>give me what you promised.”</p>\n<p>The Queen was horror-struck, and offered the Little Man all the riches</p>\n<p>of the kingdom if he would leave her the child.</p>\n<p>But the Little Man said, “No, something that is alive, is dearer to me</p>\n<p>than all the treasures in the world.”</p>\n<p>Then the Queen began to weep and cry, so that the Little Man pitied</p>\n",
        "<p>her.</p>\n<p>“I will give you three days’ time,” said he; “if by that time you</p>\n<p>find out my name, then you shall keep your child.”</p>\n<p>So the Queen thought the whole night of all the names that she had ever</p>\n<p>heard, and she sent a messenger over the country to inquire, far and</p>\n<p>wide, for any other names there might be.</p>\n<p>When the Little Man came the next day, she began with _Caspar,</p>\n",
        "<p>Melchior, Balthazar,_ and said all the names she knew, one after</p>\n<p>another.</p>\n<p>But to every one the Little Man said, “That is not my name.”</p>\n<p>On the second day, she had inquiries made in the neighborhood as to</p>\n<p>the names of the people there.</p>\n<p>And she repeated to the Little Man</p>\n<p>the most uncommon and curious, “Perhaps your name is _Shortribs_, or</p>\n",
        "<p>_Sheepshanks_, or _Laceleg_?” but he always answered, “That is not my</p>\n<p>name.”</p>\n<p>On the third day, the messenger came back again, and said, “I have not</p>\n<p>been able to find a single new name.</p>\n<p>But as I came to a high mountain</p>\n<p>at the end of the forest, where the fox and the hare bid each other</p>\n<p>good night, there I saw a little house.</p>\n",
        "<p>Before the house a fire was</p>\n<p>burning, and round about the fire a funny Little Man was jumping.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>hopped upon one leg, and shouted:</p>\n<p>“_To-day I brew, to-morrow I bake,</p>\n<p>And next, I shall the Queen’s child take!</p>\n<p>Ah!</p>\n",

        "<p>if only we had a child!” but they never had one.</p>\n<p>But it happened that once when the Queen was bathing, a Frog crept</p>\n<p>out of the water on to the land, and said to her, “Your wish shall be</p>\n<p>fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Before a year has gone by, you shall have a daughter.”</p>\n<p>What the Frog had said came true, and the Queen had a little girl, who</p>\n<p>was so pretty that the King could not contain himself for joy, and</p>\n",
        "<p>ordered a great feast.</p>\n<p>He invited not only his kindred, friends and</p>\n<p>acquaintance, but also the Wise Women, in order that they might be kind</p>\n<p>and well-disposed toward the child.</p>\n<p>There were thirteen of them in his</p>\n<p>kingdom.</p>\n<p>But, as he had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out</p>\n",
        "<p>of, one of them had to be left at home.</p>\n<p>The feast was held with all manner of splendor.</p>\n<p>When it came to an</p>\n<p>end the Wise Women bestowed their magic gifts upon the baby.</p>\n<p>One gave</p>\n<p>Virtue, another Beauty, a third Riches, and so on with everything in</p>\n<p>the world that one can wish for.</p>\n",
        "<p>When eleven of them had made their promises, suddenly the thirteenth</p>\n<p>came in.</p>\n<p>She wished to avenge herself for not having been invited, and</p>\n<p>without greeting, or even looking at any one, she cried with a loud</p>\n<p>voice, “The King’s Daughter, in her fifteenth year, shall prick herself</p>\n<p>with a spindle, and fall down dead.” And, without saying a word more,</p>\n<p>she turned round and left the room.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were all shocked.</p>\n<p>But the twelfth, whose good wish still remained</p>\n<p>unspoken, came forward, and as she could not undo the evil sentence,</p>\n<p>but only soften it, she said, “It shall not be death, but a deep sleep</p>\n<p>of a hundred years, into which the Princess shall fall.”</p>\n<p>The King, who wished to keep his dear child from the misfortune,</p>\n<p>gave orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should be burnt.</p>\n",
        "<p>Meanwhile, the gifts of the Wise Women were fulfilled on the young</p>\n<p>girl, for she was so beautiful, modest, sweet tempered, and wise, that</p>\n<p>every one who saw her, was bound to love her.</p>\n<p>It happened that on the very day, when she was fifteen years old,</p>\n<p>the King and Queen were not at home, and the maiden was left in the</p>\n<p>palace quite alone.</p>\n<p>So she went round into all sorts of places, looked</p>\n",
        "<p>into rooms and bedchambers just as she liked, and at last came to an</p>\n<p>old tower.</p>\n<p>She climbed up the narrow winding-staircase, and reached</p>\n<p>a little door.</p>\n<p>A rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it</p>\n<p>the door sprang open.</p>\n<p>There in a little room sat an Old Woman with a</p>\n",
        "<p>spindle, busily spinning flax.</p>\n<p>“Good day, old Dame,” said the King’s Daughter; “what are you doing</p>\n<p>there?”</p>\n<p>“I am spinning,” said the Old Woman, and nodded her head.</p>\n<p>“What sort of thing is that, which rattles round so merrily?” said the</p>\n<p>maiden, and she took the spindle and wanted to spin too.</p>\n<p>But scarcely</p>\n",
        "<p>had she touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled, and</p>\n<p>she pricked her finger with it.</p>\n<p>And, in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the</p>\n<p>bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.</p>\n<p>And this sleep extended</p>\n<p>over the whole palace.</p>\n<p>The King and Queen, who had just come home, and had entered the great</p>\n",

        "<p>and all over it, so that there was nothing of it to be seen, not even</p>\n<p>the flag upon the roof.</p>\n<p>But the story of the beautiful sleeping “Briar-Rose,” for so the</p>\n<p>Princess was named, went about the country, so that from time to time</p>\n<p>Kings’ Sons came and tried to get through the thorny hedge into</p>\n<p>the castle.</p>\n<p>But they found it impossible, for the thorns held fast</p>\n",
        "<p>together, as if they had hands, and the youths were caught in them,</p>\n<p>could not get loose again, and died a miserable death.</p>\n<p>After long, long years, again a King’s Son came to that country.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>heard an old man talking about the thorn-hedge, and that a castle was</p>\n<p>said to stand behind it in which a wonderfully beautiful Princess,</p>\n<p>named Briar-Rose, had been asleep for a hundred years; and that the</p>\n",
        "<p>King and Queen and the whole Court were asleep likewise.</p>\n<p>He had heard,</p>\n<p>too, from his grandfather, that many Kings’ Sons had come, and had</p>\n<p>tried to get through the thorny hedge, but they had remained sticking</p>\n<p>fast in it, so had died a pitiful death.</p>\n<p>Then the youth said, “I am not afraid.</p>\n<p>I will go and see the beautiful</p>\n",
        "<p>Briar-Rose.” The good old man might dissuade him as he would, he did</p>\n<p>not listen to his words.</p>\n<p>But by this time the hundred years had just passed.</p>\n<p>The day was come</p>\n<p>when Briar-Rose was to awake again.</p>\n<p>When the King’s Son came near to</p>\n<p>the thorn-hedge, it was nothing but large and beautiful flowers, which</p>\n",
        "<p>parted from each other of their own accord, and let him pass unhurt.</p>\n<p>Then they closed again behind him like a hedge.</p>\n<p>In the castle-yard he saw the horses and the spotted hounds lying</p>\n<p>asleep.</p>\n<p>On the roof, sat the pigeons with their heads under their</p>\n<p>wings.</p>\n<p>And when he entered the house, the flies were asleep upon the</p>\n",
        "<p>wall, the cook in the kitchen was still holding out his hand to seize</p>\n<p>the boy, and the maid was sitting by the black hen which she was going</p>\n<p>to pluck.</p>\n<p>He went on farther, and in the great hall he saw the whole of the</p>\n<p>Court lying asleep, and by the throne lay the King and Queen.</p>\n<p>Then he went on still farther, and all was so quiet that a breath could</p>\n<p>be heard.</p>\n",
        "<p>At last he came to the tower, and opened the door into the</p>\n<p>little room where Briar-Rose was sleeping.</p>\n<p>There she lay, so beautiful</p>\n<p>that he could not turn his eyes away.</p>\n<p>He stooped down and gave her a</p>\n<p>kiss.</p>\n<p>But as soon as he kissed her, Briar-Rose opened her eyes and</p>\n",
        "<p>awoke, and looked at him quite sweetly.</p>\n<p>Then they went down together, and the King awoke, and the Queen, and</p>\n<p>the whole Court, and gazed at each other in great astonishment.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>the horses in the courtyard stood up and shook themselves.</p>\n<p>The hounds</p>\n<p>jumped up and wagged their tails.</p>\n",
        "<p>The pigeons upon the roof pulled</p>\n<p>out their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into</p>\n<p>the open country.</p>\n<p>The flies on the wall crept again.</p>\n<p>The fire in the</p>\n<p>kitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat.</p>\n<p>The joint began to</p>\n",
        "<p>turn and frizzle, and the cook gave the boy such a box on the ear that</p>\n<p>he screamed, and the maid plucked the fowl ready for the spit.</p>\n<p>And then the marriage of the King’s Son and Briar-Rose was celebrated</p>\n<p>with all splendor, and they lived contented to the end of their days.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE THREE LITTLE MEN IN THE WOOD</h3>\n<p>There was once a man whose wife died, and a woman whose husband died;</p>\n",

        "<p>Then you</p>\n<p>shall wash yourself in milk every morning and drink wine; but my own</p>\n<p>daughter shall wash herself in water and drink water.”</p>\n<p>The girl went home, and told her father what the woman had said.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>man said, “What shall I do?</p>\n<p>Marriage is a joy, also a torment!”</p>\n",
        "<p>At last, as he could not decide, he pulled off his boot, and said,</p>\n<p>“Take this boot.</p>\n<p>It has a hole in the sole of it.</p>\n<p>Go with it upstairs</p>\n<p>to the loft.</p>\n<p>Hang it on the big nail.</p>\n<p>Then pour water into it.</p>\n",
        "<p>If it</p>\n<p>holds the water, then I will again take a wife.</p>\n<p>But if it runs through,</p>\n<p>I will not!”</p>\n<p>The girl did as she was ordered, but the water drew the hole together,</p>\n<p>and the boot became full to the top.</p>\n<p>She informed her father how it had</p>\n",
        "<p>turned out.</p>\n<p>Then he himself went up, and when he saw that she was right, he went to</p>\n<p>the widow and wooed her, and the wedding was celebrated.</p>\n<p>The next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the</p>\n<p>man’s daughter, milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>before the woman’s daughter, stood water to wash herself with and water</p>\n",
        "<p>for drinking.</p>\n<p>On the second morning, stood water for washing and water for drinking</p>\n<p>before the man’s daughter as well as before the woman’s daughter.</p>\n<p>And on the third morning, stood water for washing and water for</p>\n<p>drinking before the man’s daughter, and milk for washing and wine for</p>\n<p>drinking, before the woman’s daughter, and so it continued.</p>\n<p>The woman became bitterly unkind to the man’s daughter, and day by day</p>\n",
        "<p>did her best to treat her still worse.</p>\n<p>She was envious too because the</p>\n<p>man’s daughter was beautiful and lovable, and her own daughter ugly and</p>\n<p>repulsive.</p>\n<p>One day, in winter, when everything was frozen as hard as a stone, and</p>\n<p>hill and vale lay covered with snow, the woman made a frock of paper,</p>\n<p>called the man’s daughter and said, “Here, put on this dress and go out</p>\n",
        "<p>into the wood, and fetch me a little basketful of strawberries,--I have</p>\n<p>a fancy for some.”</p>\n<p>“Alas!” said the girl, “no strawberries grow in winter!</p>\n<p>The ground is</p>\n<p>frozen, and besides the snow has covered everything.</p>\n<p>And why am I to</p>\n<p>go in this paper frock?</p>\n",
        "<p>It is so cold outside that one’s very breath</p>\n<p>freezes!</p>\n<p>The wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns will tear</p>\n<p>it off my body.”</p>\n<p>“Will you contradict me again?” said the woman.</p>\n<p>“See that you go,</p>\n<p>and do not show your face again until you have the basketful of</p>\n",
        "<p>strawberries!”</p>\n<p>Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and said, “This will</p>\n<p>last you the day,” and thought, “You will die of cold and hunger</p>\n<p>outside, and will never be seen again by me.”</p>\n<p>Then the girl obeyed, and put on the paper frock, and went out with the</p>\n<p>basket.</p>\n<p>Far and wide there was nothing but snow, and not a green blade</p>\n",
        "<p>to be seen.</p>\n<p>When she got into the wood she saw a small house out of which peeped</p>\n<p>three little Dwarfs.</p>\n<p>She wished them good day, and knocked modestly at</p>\n<p>the door.</p>\n<p>They cried, “Come in,” and she entered the room and seated</p>\n<p>herself on the bench by the stove, where she began to warm herself and</p>\n",
        "<p>eat her breakfast.</p>\n<p>The Dwarfs said, “Give us some of it.”</p>\n<p>“Willingly,” said she, and divided her bit of bread in two, and gave</p>\n<p>them the half.</p>\n<p>They asked, “What do you here in the forest in the winter time, in your</p>\n<p>thin dress?”</p>\n<p>“Ah,” she answered, “I am to look for a basketful of strawberries, and</p>\n",
        "<p>am not to go home until I can take them with me.”</p>\n<p>When she had eaten her bread, they gave her a broom and said, “Sweep</p>\n<p>away the snow at the back door with it.”</p>\n<p>But when she was outside, the three Little Men said to one another,</p>\n<p>“What shall we give her as she is so good, and has shared her bread</p>\n<p>with us?”</p>\n<p>Then said the first, “My gift is, that every day she shall grow more</p>\n",
        "<p>beautiful.”</p>\n<p>The second said, “My gift is, that gold pieces shall fall out of her</p>\n<p>mouth every time she speaks.”</p>\n<p>The third said, “My gift is, that a King shall come and take her to</p>\n<p>wife.”</p>\n<p>The girl, however, did as the Little Men had bidden her, swept away the</p>\n<p>snow behind the little house with the broom.</p>\n",
        "<p>And what did she find but</p>\n<p>real ripe strawberries, which came up quite dark-red out of the snow!</p>\n<p>In her joy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the Little</p>\n<p>Men, shook hands with each of them, and ran home to take the woman what</p>\n<p>she had longed for so much.</p>\n<p>When she went in and said good-evening, a piece of gold at once fell</p>\n<p>out of her mouth.</p>\n",
        "<p>Thereupon she related what had happened to her in the</p>\n<p>wood.</p>\n<p>But with every word she spoke, gold pieces fell from her mouth,</p>\n<p>until very soon the whole room was covered with them.</p>\n<p>“Now look at her pride,” cried the woman’s daughter, “to throw about</p>\n<p>gold in that way!” but she was secretly envious of it, and wanted to go</p>\n<p>into the forest to seek strawberries.</p>\n",
        "<p>Her mother said, “No, my dear little Daughter, it is too cold, you</p>\n<p>might die of cold.”</p>\n<p>However, as her daughter let her have no peace, the mother at last</p>\n<p>yielded, made her a magnificent dress of fur, which she was obliged to</p>\n<p>put on, and gave her bread-and-butter and cake to take with her.</p>\n<p>The girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n",
        "<p>three Little Men peeped out again, but she did not greet them.</p>\n<p>Without</p>\n<p>looking round at them and without speaking to them, she went awkwardly</p>\n<p>into the room, seated herself by the stove, and began to eat her</p>\n<p>bread-and-butter and cake.</p>\n<p>“Give us some of it,” cried the Little Men.</p>\n<p>But she replied, “There is not enough for myself, so how can I give it</p>\n",
        "<p>away to other people?”</p>\n<p>When she had done eating, they said, “There is a broom for you, sweep</p>\n<p>all clean for us outside by the back-door.”</p>\n<p>“Humph!</p>\n<p>Sweep for yourselves,” she answered, “I am not your servant.”</p>\n<p>When she saw that they were not going to give her anything, she went</p>\n<p>out the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the Little Men said to each other, “What shall we</p>\n<p>give her as she is so naughty, and has a wicked envious heart, that</p>\n<p>will never let her do a good turn to any one?”</p>\n<p>The first said, “I grant that she may grow uglier every day.”</p>\n<p>The second said, “I grant that at every word she says, a toad shall</p>\n<p>spring out of her mouth.”</p>\n<p>The third said, “I grant that she may die a miserable death.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The maiden looked for strawberries outside, but as she found none, she</p>\n<p>went angrily home.</p>\n<p>And when she opened her mouth, and was about to tell</p>\n<p>her mother what had happened to her in the wood, with each word she</p>\n<p>said, a toad sprang out of her mouth, so that everybody was seized with</p>\n<p>horror of her.</p>\n<p>Then her mother was still more enraged, and thought of nothing but</p>\n",
        "<p>how to do every possible injury to the man’s daughter, whose beauty,</p>\n<p>however, grew daily greater.</p>\n<p>At length she took a cauldron, set it on</p>\n<p>the fire, and boiled yarn in it.</p>\n<p>When it was boiled, she flung it on</p>\n<p>the poor girl’s shoulder, and gave her an axe in order that she might</p>\n<p>go on the frozen river, cut a hole in the ice, and rinse the yarn.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was obedient, went thither and cut a hole in the ice.</p>\n<p>And while she</p>\n<p>was in the midst of her cutting, a splendid carriage came driving up,</p>\n<p>in which sat the King.</p>\n<p>The carriage stopped, and the King asked, “My</p>\n<p>Child, who are you, and what are you doing here?”</p>\n<p>“I am a poor girl, and I am rinsing yarn.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the King felt compassion, and when he saw that she was so very</p>\n<p>beautiful, he said to her, “Will you go away with me?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, with all my heart,” she answered, for she was glad to get</p>\n<p>away from the mother and sister.</p>\n<p>So she got into the carriage and drove away with the King, and when</p>\n<p>they arrived at his palace, the wedding was celebrated with great pomp,</p>\n<p>as the Little Men had granted to the maiden.</p>\n",
        "<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE GOLDEN BIRD</h3>\n<p>In the olden time, there was a King, who had behind his palace a</p>\n<p>beautiful pleasure-garden, in which there was a tree that bore Golden</p>\n<p>Apples.</p>\n<p>When the apples were getting ripe they were counted, but on the</p>\n<p>very next morning one was missing.</p>\n",
        "<p>This was told to the King, and he</p>\n<p>ordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the tree.</p>\n<p>The King had three sons, the eldest of whom he sent, as soon as night</p>\n<p>came, into the garden.</p>\n<p>But when it was midnight, he could not keep</p>\n<p>himself from sleeping, and next morning again an apple was gone.</p>\n<p>The following night, the second son had to keep watch, it fared no</p>\n",
        "<p>better with him.</p>\n<p>As soon as twelve o’clock had struck he fell asleep,</p>\n<p>and in the morning an apple was gone.</p>\n<p>Now, it came to the turn of the third son to watch.</p>\n<p>He was quite ready,</p>\n<p>but the King had not much trust in him, and thought that he would be of</p>\n<p>less use than his brothers.</p>\n",
        "<p>But at last he let him go.</p>\n<p>The youth lay down beneath the tree, but kept awake, and did not let</p>\n<p>sleep master him.</p>\n<p>When it struck twelve, something rustled through</p>\n<p>the air, and in the moonlight he saw a bird coming whose feathers were</p>\n<p>shining with gold.</p>\n<p>The bird alighted on the tree, and had just plucked</p>\n",
        "<p>off an apple, when the youth shot an arrow at him.</p>\n<p>The bird flew off,</p>\n<p>but the arrow had struck his plumage, and one of his golden feathers</p>\n<p>fell down.</p>\n<p>The youth picked it up, and the next morning took it to the King and</p>\n<p>told him what he had seen in the night.</p>\n<p>The King called his council</p>\n",
        "<p>together, and every one declared that a feather like this was worth</p>\n<p>more than the whole kingdom.</p>\n<p>“If the feather is so precious,” declared the King, “one alone will not</p>\n<p>do for me.</p>\n<p>I must and will have the whole bird!”</p>\n<p>The eldest son set out.</p>\n<p>He trusted to his cleverness, and thought that</p>\n",
        "<p>he would easily find the Golden Bird.</p>\n<p>When he had gone some distance he</p>\n<p>saw a Fox sitting at the edge of a wood, so he cocked his gun and took</p>\n<p>aim at him.</p>\n<p>The Fox cried, “Do not shoot me!</p>\n<p>And in return I will give you some</p>\n<p>good counsel.</p>\n",
        "<p>You are on the way to the Golden Bird.</p>\n<p>This evening you</p>\n<p>will come to a village in which stand two inns opposite to one another.</p>\n<p>One of them is lighted up brightly, and all goes on merrily within, but</p>\n<p>do not enter it.</p>\n<p>Go rather into the other, even though it seems a bad</p>\n<p>one.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“How can such a silly beast give wise advice?” thought the King’s Son,</p>\n<p>and he pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p>But he missed the Fox, who stretched out his</p>\n<p>tail and ran quickly into the wood.</p>\n<p>So he pursued his way, and by evening came to the village where the two</p>\n<p>inns were.</p>\n<p>In one they were singing and dancing.</p>\n",
        "<p>The other had a poor,</p>\n<p>miserable look.</p>\n<p>[Illustration: IN THE MOONLIGHT HE SAW A BIRD]</p>\n<p>“I should be a fool, indeed,” he thought, “if I were to go into the</p>\n<p>shabby tavern, and pass by the good one.” So he went into the cheerful</p>\n<p>one, lived there in riot and revel, and forgot the bird and his father,</p>\n<p>and all good counsels.</p>\n",
        "<p>Some time had passed, and when the eldest son, month after month,</p>\n<p>did not come home, the second set out, wishing to find the Golden</p>\n<p>Bird.</p>\n<p>The Fox met him as he had met the eldest, and gave him the good</p>\n<p>advice, of which he took no heed.</p>\n<p>He came to the two inns.</p>\n<p>His brother</p>\n",
        "<p>was standing at the window of the one from which came the music, and</p>\n<p>called to him.</p>\n<p>He could not resist, but went inside, and lived only for</p>\n<p>pleasure.</p>\n<p>Again some time passed, and then the youngest King’s Son wanted to set</p>\n<p>off and try his luck.</p>\n<p>But his father would not allow it.</p>\n",
        "<p>“It is of no</p>\n<p>use,” said he, “he will be less likely to find the Golden Bird than his</p>\n<p>brothers.</p>\n<p>And if a mishap were to befall him, he knows not how to help</p>\n<p>himself.</p>\n<p>He is a little wanting at the best.” But at last, as he had no</p>\n<p>peace, he let him go.</p>\n",
        "<p>Again the Fox was sitting outside the wood, and begged for his life,</p>\n<p>and offered his good advice.</p>\n<p>The youth was good-natured, and said, “Be</p>\n<p>easy, little Fox, I will do you no harm.”</p>\n<p>“You shall not repent it,” answered the Fox; “and that you may proceed</p>\n<p>more quickly, get up behind on my tail.”</p>\n<p>And scarcely had he seated himself, when the Fox began to run, and</p>\n",

        "<p>Apples lay about the room.</p>\n<p>“But,” thought he, “it would be absurd if I were to leave the beautiful</p>\n<p>bird in the common and ugly cage,” so he opened the door, laid hold of</p>\n<p>it, and put it into the golden cage.</p>\n<p>But at the same moment the bird</p>\n<p>uttered a shrill cry.</p>\n<p>The soldiers awoke, rushed in, and took him off to prison.</p>\n",
        "<p>The next</p>\n<p>morning he was taken before a court of justice, and as he confessed</p>\n<p>everything, was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>The King, however, said that he would grant him his life on one</p>\n<p>condition--namely, if he brought him the Golden Horse which ran faster</p>\n<p>than the wind.</p>\n<p>And in that case he should receive, over and above, as a</p>\n",

        "<p>However, be of good courage.</p>\n<p>I will help you, and tell you</p>\n<p>how to get to the Golden Horse.</p>\n<p>You must go straight on, and you will</p>\n<p>come to a castle, where in the stable stands the horse.</p>\n<p>The grooms will</p>\n<p>be lying in front of the stable.</p>\n",

        "<p>The next morning, the King said to him, “Your life is forfeited, and</p>\n<p>you can only find mercy if you take away the hill which stands in</p>\n<p>front of my windows, and prevents my seeing beyond it.</p>\n<p>And you must</p>\n<p>finish it all within eight days.</p>\n<p>If you do that you shall have my</p>\n<p>daughter as your reward.”</p>\n",

        "<p>And whether he liked it or not, the King had to</p>\n<p>hold to his word and give him his daughter.</p>\n<p>So the two set forth together, and it was not long before the trusty</p>\n<p>Fox came up with them.</p>\n<p>“You have certainly got what is best,” said he,</p>\n<p>“but the Golden Horse also belongs to the maiden of the Golden Castle.”</p>\n<p>“How shall I get it?” asked the youth.</p>\n",

        "<p>things.</p>\n<p>Buy no gallows’-flesh, and do not sit at the edge of any well.”</p>\n<p>And then he ran into the wood.</p>\n<p>The youth thought, “That is a wonderful beast, he has strange whims.</p>\n<p>Who is going to buy gallows’-flesh?</p>\n<p>and the desire to sit at the edge</p>\n<p>of a well has never yet seized me.”</p>\n",
        "<p>He rode on with the beautiful maiden, and his road took him again</p>\n<p>through the village in which his two brothers had remained.</p>\n<p>There was a</p>\n<p>great stir and noise, and, when he asked what was going on, he was told</p>\n<p>that two men were going to be hanged.</p>\n<p>As he came nearer to the place</p>\n<p>he saw that they were his brothers, who had been playing all kinds of</p>\n",
        "<p>wicked pranks, and had squandered their entire wealth.</p>\n<p>He inquired</p>\n<p>whether they could not be set free.</p>\n<p>“If you will pay for them,” answered the people; “but why should you</p>\n<p>waste your money on wicked men, and buy them free?”</p>\n<p>He did not think twice about it, but paid for them.</p>\n<p>And when they were</p>\n",
        "<p>set free they all went on their way together.</p>\n<p>They came to the wood where the Fox had first met them, and, as it</p>\n<p>was cool and pleasant within it, whilst the sun shone hotly, the two</p>\n<p>brothers said, “Let us rest a little by the well, and eat and drink.”</p>\n<p>He agreed, and whilst they were talking he forgot himself, and sat down</p>\n<p>upon the edge of the well without foreboding any evil.</p>\n<p>But the two</p>\n",
        "<p>brothers threw him backwards into the well, took the maiden, the Horse,</p>\n<p>and the Bird, and went home to their father.</p>\n<p>“Here we bring you not</p>\n<p>only the Golden Bird,” said they; “we have won the Golden Horse also,</p>\n<p>and the maiden from the Golden Castle.”</p>\n<p>Then was there great joy.</p>\n<p>But the Horse would not eat, the Bird would</p>\n",
        "<p>not sing, and the maiden sat and wept.</p>\n<p>But the youngest brother was not dead.</p>\n<p>By good fortune the well was</p>\n<p>dry, and he fell upon soft moss without being hurt.</p>\n<p>But he could not</p>\n<p>get out again.</p>\n<p>Even in this strait, the faithful Fox did not leave him.</p>\n",
        "<p>He came and leapt down to him, and upbraided him for having forgotten</p>\n<p>his advice.</p>\n<p>“But yet I cannot give it up so,” he said; “I will help you</p>\n<p>up again into daylight.” He bade him grasp his tail and keep tight hold</p>\n<p>of it; and then he pulled him up.</p>\n<p>“You are not out of all danger yet,” said the Fox.</p>\n<p>“Your brothers were</p>\n",
        "<p>not sure of your death, and have surrounded the wood with watchers, who</p>\n<p>are to kill you if you let yourself be seen.”</p>\n<p>But a poor man was sitting upon the road, with whom the youth changed</p>\n<p>clothes, and in this way he got to the King’s palace.</p>\n<p>No one knew him, but the Bird began to sing, the Horse began to eat,</p>\n<p>and the beautiful maiden left off weeping.</p>\n<p>The King, astonished, asked,</p>\n",
        "<p>“What does this mean?”</p>\n<p>Then the maiden said, “I do not know, but I have been so sorrowful and</p>\n<p>now I am so happy!</p>\n<p>I feel as if my true Bridegroom had come.” She told</p>\n<p>him all that had happened, although the other brothers had threatened</p>\n<p>her with death if she were to betray anything.</p>\n<p>The King commanded that all people, who were in his castle, should</p>\n",
        "<p>be brought before him; and amongst them came the youth in his ragged</p>\n<p>clothes.</p>\n<p>But the maiden knew him at once and fell upon his neck.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>wicked brothers were seized and put to death, but he was married to the</p>\n<p>beautiful maiden and declared heir to the King.</p>\n<p>But how did it fare with the poor Fox?</p>\n",
        "<p>Long afterward, the King’s Son</p>\n<p>was once again walking in the wood, when the Fox met him and said, “You</p>\n<p>have everything now that you can wish for.</p>\n<p>But there is never an end to</p>\n<p>my misery, and yet it is in your power to free me,” and again he asked</p>\n<p>him with tears to shoot him dead and to chop off his head and feet.</p>\n<p>So he did it, and scarcely was it done when the Fox was changed into a</p>\n",
        "<p>man, and was no other than the brother of the beautiful Princess, who</p>\n<p>at last was freed from the magic charm which had been laid upon him.</p>\n<p>And now nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they</p>\n<p>lived.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE QUEEN BEE</h3>\n<p>Two King’s Sons once went out in search of adventures, and fell into a</p>\n",
        "<p>wild, disorderly way of living, so that they never came home again.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>youngest, who was called Simpleton, set out to seek his brothers.</p>\n<p>When</p>\n<p>at length he found them, they mocked him for thinking that he with his</p>\n<p>simplicity could get through the world, when they two could not make</p>\n<p>their way, and yet were so much cleverer.</p>\n",
        "<p>They all three traveled away together, and came to an ant-hill.</p>\n<p>The two</p>\n<p>elder wanted to destroy it, to see the little ants creeping about in</p>\n<p>their terror, carrying their eggs away, but Simpleton said, “Leave the</p>\n<p>creatures in peace.</p>\n<p>I will not allow you to disturb them.”</p>\n<p>Then they went farther, and came to a lake, on which a great number</p>\n",
        "<p>of ducks were swimming.</p>\n<p>The two brothers wanted to catch a couple and</p>\n<p>roast them, but Simpleton would not permit it, and said, “Leave the</p>\n<p>creatures in peace.</p>\n<p>I will not suffer you to kill them.”</p>\n<p>At length they came to a bee’s nest, in which there was so much honey,</p>\n<p>that it ran out of the trunk of the tree where it was.</p>\n",
        "<p>The two wanted</p>\n<p>to make a fire under the tree, and suffocate the bees in order to take</p>\n<p>away the honey, but Simpleton again stopped them and said, “Leave the</p>\n<p>creatures in peace.</p>\n<p>I will not allow you to burn them.”</p>\n<p>At last the two brothers arrived at a castle where stone horses were</p>\n<p>standing in the stables, and no human being was to be seen.</p>\n",
        "<p>They went</p>\n<p>through all the halls until they came to a door in which were three</p>\n<p>locks.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the door there was a little pane, through which</p>\n<p>they could see into the room.</p>\n<p>There they saw a little Gray Man sitting at a table.</p>\n<p>They called him,</p>\n",
        "<p>once, twice, but he did not hear.</p>\n<p>Then they called him for the third</p>\n<p>time, when he got up, opened the locks, and came out.</p>\n<p>He said nothing</p>\n<p>but led them to a handsomely-spread table; and when they had eaten and</p>\n<p>drunk, he took each of them to a bedroom.</p>\n<p>Next morning, the little Gray Man came to the eldest, beckoned to him,</p>\n",
        "<p>and conducted him to a stone table, on which were inscribed three</p>\n<p>tasks, by the doing of which the castle could be delivered.</p>\n<p>The first</p>\n<p>was that in the forest, beneath the moss, lay the Princess’s pearls,</p>\n<p>a thousand in number, which must be picked up.</p>\n<p>And if by sunset, one</p>\n<p>single pearl was wanting, he who had looked for them would be turned to</p>\n",
        "<p>stone.</p>\n<p>The eldest went thither, and sought the whole day, but when it came</p>\n<p>to an end, he had found only one hundred, and what was written on the</p>\n<p>table came to pass, he was changed into stone.</p>\n<p>Next day, the second brother undertook the adventure.</p>\n<p>It did not,</p>\n<p>however, fare much better with him than with the eldest.</p>\n",
        "<p>He did not</p>\n<p>find more than two hundred pearls, and was changed to stone.</p>\n<p>At last, the turn came to Simpleton, who sought in the moss.</p>\n<p>But it was</p>\n<p>so hard to find the pearls, and he got on so slowly, that he seated</p>\n<p>himself on a stone, and wept.</p>\n<p>And while he was thus sitting, the King</p>\n",
        "<p>of the Ants, whose life he had once saved, came with five thousand</p>\n<p>ants, and before long the little creatures had got all the pearls</p>\n<p>together, and laid them in a heap.</p>\n<p>The second task was to fetch out of the lake the key of the King’s</p>\n<p>Daughter’s bedchamber.</p>\n<p>When Simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which</p>\n<p>he had saved, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the key out of</p>\n",
        "<p>the water.</p>\n<p>But the third task was the most difficult.</p>\n<p>From amongst the three</p>\n<p>sleeping daughters of the King, the youngest and dearest was to be</p>\n<p>sought out.</p>\n<p>They resembled each other exactly, and were only to be</p>\n<p>distinguished by their having eaten different sweetmeats before they</p>\n",
        "<p>fell asleep: the eldest a bit of sugar; the second a little syrup; and</p>\n<p>the youngest a spoonful of honey.</p>\n<p>Then the Queen of the Bees, which Simpleton had protected from the</p>\n<p>fire, came and tasted the lips of all three.</p>\n<p>At last she remained</p>\n<p>sitting on the mouth which had eaten honey; and thus the King’s Son</p>\n<p>recognized the right Princess.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the enchantment was at an end.</p>\n<p>Everything was released from sleep,</p>\n<p>and those who had been turned to stone received once more their natural</p>\n<p>forms.</p>\n<p>Simpleton married the youngest and sweetest Princess, and after</p>\n<p>her father’s death became King, while his two brothers received the two</p>\n<p>other sisters.</p>\n",

        "<p>Lina.”</p>\n<p>He took him home, and the two children grew up together.</p>\n<p>The one he had</p>\n<p>found in a tree, he called Bird-Found, because a bird had carried it</p>\n<p>away.</p>\n<p>Bird-Found and Lina loved each other so dearly, that when they did not</p>\n<p>see each other they were sad.</p>\n",
        "<p>The forester, however, had an old cook, who one evening took two pails</p>\n<p>and began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out</p>\n<p>to the spring.</p>\n<p>Lina saw this and said, “Hark you, old Sanna, why are you fetching so</p>\n<p>much water?”</p>\n<p>Then the cook said, “Early to-morrow morning, when the forester is out</p>\n<p>hunting, I will heat the water.</p>\n",
        "<p>When it is boiling in the kettle, I</p>\n<p>will throw in Bird-Found, and will boil him in it.”</p>\n<p>Betimes next morning, the forester got up and went out hunting, and</p>\n<p>when he was gone the children were still in bed.</p>\n<p>Then Lina said to</p>\n<p>Bird-Found, “If you will never leave me, I will never leave you.”</p>\n<p>Bird-Found said, “Neither now, nor ever, will I leave you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then said Lina, “I will tell you.</p>\n<p>Last night, old Sanna carried so many</p>\n<p>buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing so.</p>\n<p>She said that early to-morrow morning, when Father was out hunting, she</p>\n<p>would set on the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you.</p>\n<p>But we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.”</p>\n<p>The two children, therefore, got up, dressed themselves quickly, and</p>\n",
        "<p>went away.</p>\n<p>When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook came into</p>\n<p>the bedroom to fetch Bird-Found and throw him into it.</p>\n<p>But when she</p>\n<p>came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone.</p>\n<p>Then she was terribly frightened, and she said to herself, “What shall</p>\n<p>I say now when the forester comes home and sees that the children are</p>\n",
        "<p>gone?</p>\n<p>They must be followed instantly and brought back.”</p>\n<p>Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and</p>\n<p>overtake the children.</p>\n<p>The children, however, were sitting outside the forest, and when they</p>\n<p>saw from afar the three servants running, Lina said to Bird-Found,</p>\n<p>“Never leave me, and I will never leave you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Bird-Found said, “Neither now, nor ever.”</p>\n<p>Then said Lina, “Do you become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.”</p>\n<p>When the three servants came to the forest, nothing was there but a</p>\n<p>rose-tree and one rose on it; the children were nowhere.</p>\n<p>Said they,</p>\n<p>“There is nothing to be done here,” and they went home and told the</p>\n<p>cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush</p>\n",
        "<p>with one rose on it.</p>\n<p>Then the old cook scolded and said, “You simpletons, you should have</p>\n<p>cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it</p>\n<p>home with you.</p>\n<p>Go, and do it at once.”</p>\n<p>They had therefore to go out and look for the second time.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n",
        "<p>children, however, saw them coming from a distance.</p>\n<p>Then Lina said, “Bird-Found, never leave me, and I will never leave</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>Bird-Found said, “Neither now, nor ever.”</p>\n<p>Said Lina, “Then do you become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in</p>\n<p>it.”</p>\n<p>So when the three servants came, nothing was there but a church, with</p>\n",
        "<p>a chandelier in it.</p>\n<p>They said therefore to each other, “What can we do</p>\n<p>here?</p>\n<p>Let us go home.” When they got home, the cook asked if they had</p>\n<p>not found them.</p>\n<p>They said no, they had found nothing but a church, and</p>\n<p>that there was a chandelier in it.</p>\n",
        "<p>The cook scolded them and said, “You fools!</p>\n<p>Why did you not pull the</p>\n<p>church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?”</p>\n<p>And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went, with the three</p>\n<p>servants, in pursuit of the children.</p>\n<p>The children saw from afar that</p>\n<p>the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling after them.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then said Lina, “Bird-Found, never leave me, and I will never leave</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>Then said Bird-Found, “Neither now, nor ever.”</p>\n<p>Said Lina, “Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.”</p>\n<p>The cook, however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay</p>\n<p>down by it, and was about to drink it up, when she fell into the water,</p>\n<p>and there the old Witch had to drown.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and</p>\n<p>if they are not dead, they are living still.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE GOLDEN GOOSE</h3>\n<p>There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called</p>\n<p>Dunderhead, and was despised, mocked, and put down on every occasion.</p>\n<p>It happened, that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood.</p>\n",
        "<p>Before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle</p>\n<p>of wine, that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.</p>\n<p>When he entered the forest, there met him a little old Gray Man who</p>\n<p>bade him good-day, and said, “Do give me a piece of cake out of your</p>\n<p>pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine.</p>\n<p>I am so hungry and</p>\n<p>thirsty.”</p>\n",
        "<p>But the prudent youth answered, “If I give you my cake and wine, I</p>\n<p>shall have none for myself.</p>\n<p>Be off with you,” and he left the Little</p>\n<p>Man standing and went on.</p>\n<p>But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a</p>\n<p>false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm.</p>\n<p>So he had to go home and</p>\n",
        "<p>have it bound up.</p>\n<p>And this was the little Gray Man’s doing.</p>\n<p>After this, the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave</p>\n<p>him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine.</p>\n<p>The little old Gray</p>\n<p>Man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of</p>\n<p>wine.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the second son, too, said with much reason, “What I give you</p>\n<p>will be taken away from myself.</p>\n<p>Be off!” and he left the Little Man</p>\n<p>standing and went on.</p>\n<p>His punishment, however, was not delayed.</p>\n<p>When he had made a few</p>\n<p>strokes at the tree, he struck himself in the leg.</p>\n",
        "<p>So he had to be</p>\n<p>carried home.</p>\n<p>Then Dunderhead said, “Father, do let me go and cut wood.”</p>\n<p>The father answered, “Your brothers have hurt themselves doing so.</p>\n<p>Leave it alone.</p>\n<p>You do not understand anything about it.”</p>\n<p>But Dunderhead begged so long that at last he said, “Go then.</p>\n",
        "<p>You will</p>\n<p>get wiser by hurting yourself.”</p>\n<p>His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders,</p>\n<p>and with it a bottle of sour beer.</p>\n<p>When he came to the forest the little old Gray Man met him likewise,</p>\n<p>and greeting him said, “Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of</p>\n<p>your bottle.</p>\n",
        "<p>I am so hungry and thirsty.”</p>\n<p>Dunderhead answered, “I have only cinder-cake and sour beer.</p>\n<p>If that</p>\n<p>pleases you, we will sit down and eat.”</p>\n<p>So they sat down, and when Dunderhead pulled out his cinder-cake, it</p>\n<p>was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine.</p>\n<p>So they ate and drank, and after that the Little Man said, “Since you</p>\n",
        "<p>have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will</p>\n<p>give you good luck.</p>\n<p>There stands an old tree.</p>\n<p>Cut it down, and you will</p>\n<p>find something at the roots.”</p>\n<p>Then the old man took leave of him.</p>\n<p>Dunderhead went and cut down the tree; and when it fell there was a</p>\n",
        "<p>Goose sitting in the roots, with feathers of pure gold.</p>\n<p>He lifted her</p>\n<p>up, and taking her with him, went to an inn, where he thought he would</p>\n<p>stay the night.</p>\n<p>Now the host had three daughters, who saw the Goose</p>\n<p>and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be.</p>\n<p>And each</p>\n",
        "<p>wanted one of its feathers.</p>\n<p>The eldest thought, “I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a</p>\n<p>feather,” and when Dunderhead was gone out, she seized the Goose by the</p>\n<p>wing.</p>\n<p>But her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.</p>\n<p>The second came in soon afterward, thinking only of how she might get a</p>\n<p>feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she</p>\n",

        "<p>But</p>\n<p>as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>So they had to spend the night with the Goose.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Dunderhead took the Goose under his arm and set out,</p>\n<p>without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n",

        "<p>There was once a widow who had two daughters, one of whom was beautiful</p>\n<p>and industrious, whilst the other was ugly and lazy.</p>\n<p>But she was much</p>\n<p>fonder of the ugly and lazy one.</p>\n<p>Every day, the other, poor girl, had</p>\n<p>to sit by a well in the highway, and _spin, spin_ till her fingers bled.</p>\n<p>Now it happened, one day, that the shuttle was stained with her blood.</p>\n",
        "<p>She dipped it in the well to wash the stains off, and it dropped out</p>\n<p>of her hand and fell to the bottom.</p>\n<p>She began to weep, and ran to the</p>\n<p>woman, and told her of the mishap.</p>\n<p>She scolded her hard, and was so cruel as to say, “Since you have let</p>\n<p>the shuttle fall in, you must fetch it out again.”</p>\n<p>So the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then in</p>\n<p>the anguish of her heart, she jumped into the well to get the shuttle.</p>\n<p>She lost her senses.</p>\n<p>But when she awoke and came to herself, she was</p>\n<p>in a lovely meadow, where the sun was shining and thousands of flowers</p>\n<p>were growing.</p>\n<p>Along this meadow she went, and at length came to a baker’s oven full</p>\n",
        "<p>of bread.</p>\n<p>And the bread cried:</p>\n<p>“_Oh, take me out!</p>\n<p>Take me out!</p>\n<p>Or I shall burn.</p>\n<p>I am well baked!_”</p>\n<p>So she went up to it, and, with the bread shovel, took out all the</p>\n",

        "<p>shaking till they were all down.</p>\n<p>And when she had gathered them into a</p>\n<p>heap, she went on her way.</p>\n<p>At last, she came to a little house out of which an Old Woman was</p>\n<p>peeping.</p>\n<p>She had such large teeth that the girl was frightened, and was</p>\n<p>about to run away.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the Old Woman called out to her, “What are you afraid of, my Child?</p>\n<p>Stay with me.</p>\n<p>If you will do the work in my house carefully, you shall</p>\n<p>be the better for it!</p>\n<p>Only you must take care to make my bed well, and</p>\n<p>to shake it thoroughly till the feathers fly--for then it snows on</p>\n<p>earth.</p>\n",
        "<p>I am Mother Holle.”</p>\n<p>As the Old Woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took heart, and</p>\n<p>willingly entered her service.</p>\n<p>She did everything to the Old Woman’s</p>\n<p>satisfaction, and always shook her bed so hard that the feathers flew</p>\n<p>about like snowflakes.</p>\n<p>So she lived happily with her, never an angry</p>\n",

        "<p>At last, she said to the Old Woman, “I am longing for home.</p>\n<p>However</p>\n<p>well off I am down here, I cannot stay any longer.</p>\n<p>I must go up again</p>\n<p>to my own people.”</p>\n<p>Mother Holle said, “I am pleased that you long for your home again.</p>\n<p>You</p>\n",

        "<p>Then she threw her shuttle into the well, and jumped in</p>\n<p>after it.</p>\n<p>She came like the other to the beautiful meadow, and walked along the</p>\n<p>very same path.</p>\n<p>When she got to the oven, the bread cried again:</p>\n<p>“_Oh, take me out!</p>\n<p>Take me out!</p>\n",

        "<p>We apples are all ripe!_”</p>\n<p>But she answered, “I like that!</p>\n<p>One of you might fall on my head!” and</p>\n<p>on she went.</p>\n<p>When she came to Mother Holle’s house, she was not afraid, for she had</p>\n<p>already heard about her big teeth.</p>\n<p>She hired herself out immediately.</p>\n",

        "<p>In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other</p>\n<p>in their travels.</p>\n<p>The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full</p>\n<p>of enjoyment.</p>\n<p>He saw the shoemaker coming toward him from the other</p>\n<p>side, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he</p>\n<p>sang a little mocking song to him:</p>\n",
        "<p>_Sew me the seam,</p>\n<p>Draw me the thread,</p>\n<p>Spread it with pitch,</p>\n<p>Knock the nail on the head._</p>\n<p>The shoemaker, however, could not endure a joke.</p>\n<p>He pulled a face as if</p>\n<p>he had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize</p>\n",
        "<p>the tailor by the throat.</p>\n<p>But the little fellow began to laugh, reached him his bottle, and said,</p>\n<p>“No harm was meant, take a drink, and swallow your anger down.”</p>\n<p>The shoemaker took a very hearty drink, and the storm on his face began</p>\n<p>to clear away.</p>\n<p>He gave the bottle back to the tailor, and said, “I spoke civilly to</p>\n<p>you.</p>\n",
        "<p>One speaks well after much drinking, but not after much thirst.</p>\n<p>Shall we travel together?”</p>\n<p>“All right,” answered the tailor, “if only it suits you to go into a</p>\n<p>big town where there is no lack of work.”</p>\n<p>“That is just where I want to go,” answered the shoemaker.</p>\n<p>“In a small</p>\n<p>nest there is nothing to earn; and in the country, people like to go</p>\n",
        "<p>barefoot.”</p>\n<p>They traveled therefore onward together, and always set one foot before</p>\n<p>the other like a weazel in the snow.</p>\n<p>Both of them had time enough, but little to bite and to break.</p>\n<p>When</p>\n<p>they reached a town, they went about and paid their respects to the</p>\n<p>tradesmen.</p>\n",
        "<p>Because the tailor looked so lively and merry, and had such pretty red</p>\n<p>cheeks, every one gave him work willingly.</p>\n<p>And when luck was good, the</p>\n<p>master’s daughters gave him a kiss beneath the porch, as well.</p>\n<p>When he</p>\n<p>again fell in with the shoemaker, the tailor had always the most in his</p>\n<p>bundle.</p>\n",
        "<p>The ill-tempered shoemaker made a wry face, and thought, “The greater</p>\n<p>the rascal the more the luck.”</p>\n<p>But the tailor began to laugh and to sing, and shared all he got with</p>\n<p>his comrade.</p>\n<p>If a couple of pence jingled in his pockets, he ordered</p>\n<p>good cheer, and thumped the table in his joy till the glasses danced,</p>\n<p>and it was lightly come, lightly go, with him.</p>\n",
        "<p>When they had traveled for some time, they came to a great forest</p>\n<p>through which passed the road to the capital.</p>\n<p>Two foot-paths, however,</p>\n<p>led through it, one of them a seven days’ journey, and the other only</p>\n<p>two.</p>\n<p>But neither of the travelers knew which way was the short one.</p>\n<p>They seated themselves beneath an oak-tree, and took counsel together</p>\n",
        "<p>as to what they should do and for how many days they should provide</p>\n<p>themselves with bread.</p>\n<p>The shoemaker said, “One must look before one leaps.</p>\n<p>I will take with</p>\n<p>me bread for a week.”</p>\n<p>“What!” said the tailor, “drag bread for seven days on one’s back like</p>\n<p>a beast of burden, and not be able to look about.</p>\n",
        "<p>I shall trust in God,</p>\n<p>and not trouble myself about anything!</p>\n<p>The money I have in my pocket is</p>\n<p>as good in summer as in winter; but in hot weather bread gets dry and</p>\n<p>mouldy into the bargain.</p>\n<p>Even my coat does not go as far as it might.</p>\n<p>Besides, why should we not find the right way?</p>\n",
        "<p>Bread for two days, and</p>\n<p>that’s enough.”</p>\n<p>Each, therefore, bought his own bread.</p>\n<p>And then they tried their luck</p>\n<p>in the forest.</p>\n<p>It was as quiet there as in a church.</p>\n<p>No wind stirred, no brook</p>\n",
        "<p>murmured, no bird sang, and through the thickly-leaved branches, no</p>\n<p>sunbeam forced its way.</p>\n<p>The shoemaker spoke never a word, the heavy bread weighed down his back</p>\n<p>until the perspiration streamed down his cross and gloomy face.</p>\n<p>The tailor, however, was quite merry; he jumped about, whistled on a</p>\n<p>leaf, or sang a song, and thought to himself, “God in Heaven must be</p>\n<p>pleased to see me so happy.”</p>\n",
        "<p>This lasted two days, but on the third the forest would not come to an</p>\n<p>end, and the tailor had eaten up all his bread, so after all his heart</p>\n<p>sank down a yard deeper.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, he did not lose courage, but</p>\n<p>relied on God and on his luck.</p>\n<p>On the third day, he lay down in the evening hungry under a tree, and</p>\n<p>rose again next morning hungry still.</p>\n",
        "<p>So also passed the fourth day, and when the shoemaker seated himself on</p>\n<p>a fallen tree and devoured his dinner, the tailor was only a looker-on.</p>\n<p>If he begged for a little piece of bread the other laughed mockingly,</p>\n<p>and said, “You have always been so merry, now you can try for once what</p>\n<p>it is to be sad.</p>\n<p>The birds which sing too early in the morning, are</p>\n<p>struck by the hawk in the evening,” in short he was pitiless.</p>\n",
        "<p>But on the fifth morning, the poor tailor could no longer stand up, and</p>\n<p>was hardly able to utter one word for weakness.</p>\n<p>His cheeks were white,</p>\n<p>and his eyes red.</p>\n<p>Then the shoemaker said to him, “I will give you a bit of bread to-day,</p>\n<p>but in return for it, I will put out your right eye.”</p>\n<p>The unhappy tailor, who still wished to save his life, could not do it</p>\n",
        "<p>in any other way.</p>\n<p>He wept once more with both eyes, and then held them</p>\n<p>out.</p>\n<p>The shoemaker, who had a heart of stone, put out his right eye</p>\n<p>with a sharp knife.</p>\n<p>The tailor called to remembrance what his mother had formerly said to</p>\n<p>him when he had been eating secretly in the pantry, “Eat what one can,</p>\n",
        "<p>and suffer what one must.”</p>\n<p>When he had consumed his dearly-bought bread, he got on his legs again,</p>\n<p>forgot his misery and comforted himself with the thought that he could</p>\n<p>always see enough with one eye.</p>\n<p>But on the sixth day, hunger made itself felt again, and gnawed him</p>\n<p>almost to the heart.</p>\n<p>In the evening he fell down by a tree, and on the</p>\n",
        "<p>seventh morning he could not raise himself up for faintness, and death</p>\n<p>was close at hand.</p>\n<p>Then said the shoemaker, “I will show mercy and give you bread once</p>\n<p>more, but you shall not have it for nothing.</p>\n<p>I shall put out your other</p>\n<p>eye for it.”</p>\n<p>And now the tailor felt how thoughtless his life had been, prayed to</p>\n",
        "<p>God for forgiveness, and said, “Do what you will, I will bear what I</p>\n<p>must, but remember that our Lord God does not always look on passively,</p>\n<p>and that an hour will come when the evil deed, which you have done to</p>\n<p>me and which I have not deserved of you, will be requited.</p>\n<p>When times</p>\n<p>were good with me, I shared what I had with you.</p>\n<p>My trade is of that</p>\n",
        "<p>kind that each stitch must always be exactly like the other.</p>\n<p>If I no</p>\n<p>longer have my eyes and can sew no more, I must go a-begging.</p>\n<p>At any</p>\n<p>rate, do not leave me here alone when I am blind, or I shall die of</p>\n<p>hunger.”</p>\n<p>The shoemaker, however, who had driven God out of his heart, took the</p>\n",

        "<p>Weariness, pain, and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep, and he</p>\n<p>slept the whole night.</p>\n<p>When day dawned he awoke, but knew not where he</p>\n<p>lay.</p>\n<p>Two poor sinners were hanging on the gallows, and a crow sat on the</p>\n<p>head of each of them.</p>\n<p>Then one of the men who had been hanged began to</p>\n",
        "<p>speak, and said, “Brother, are you awake?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I am awake,” answered the second.</p>\n<p>“Then I will tell you something,” said the first; “the dew which this</p>\n<p>night has fallen down over us from the gallows, gives every one who</p>\n<p>washes himself with it, his eyes again.</p>\n<p>If blind people did but know</p>\n<p>this, how many would regain their sight who do not believe that to be</p>\n",
        "<p>possible!”</p>\n<p>When the tailor heard that, he took his pocket-handkerchief, pressed it</p>\n<p>on the grass, and when it was moist with dew, washed the sockets of his</p>\n<p>eyes with it.</p>\n<p>Immediately was fulfilled what the man on the gallows had</p>\n<p>said, and a couple of healthy new eyes filled the sockets.</p>\n<p>It was not long before the tailor saw the sun rise behind the</p>\n",
        "<p>mountains.</p>\n<p>In the plain before him, lay the great royal city with its</p>\n<p>magnificent gates and hundred towers.</p>\n<p>The golden balls and crosses</p>\n<p>which were on the spires began to shine.</p>\n<p>He could distinguish every</p>\n<p>leaf on the trees, saw the birds which flew past, and the midges which</p>\n",
        "<p>danced in the air.</p>\n<p>He took a needle out of his pocket, and as he could</p>\n<p>thread it as well as ever he had done, his heart danced with delight.</p>\n<p>He threw himself on his knees, thanked God for the mercy he had shown</p>\n<p>him, and said his morning prayer.</p>\n<p>Then he took his bundle on his back, and soon forgot the pain of heart</p>\n<p>he had endured, and went on his way singing and whistling.</p>\n",
        "<p>The first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at</p>\n<p>large.</p>\n<p>He caught it by the mane, and wanted to spring on it and ride</p>\n<p>into the town.</p>\n<p>The foal, however, begged to be set free.</p>\n<p>“I am still too young,” it</p>\n<p>said, “even a light tailor such as you are would break my back in</p>\n",
        "<p>two--let me go till I have grown strong.</p>\n<p>A time may come when I can</p>\n<p>reward you for it.”</p>\n<p>“Run off,” said the tailor, “I see you are still a giddy thing.”</p>\n<p>He gave it a touch with a switch over its back, whereupon it kicked up</p>\n<p>its hind legs for joy, leapt over hedges and ditches, and galloped away</p>\n<p>into the open country.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before.</p>\n<p>“The sun</p>\n<p>to be sure fills my eyes,” said he, “but the bread does not fill my</p>\n<p>mouth.</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes across me and is even half eatable,</p>\n<p>will have to suffer for it.”</p>\n<p>In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow toward him.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Halt, halt!” cried the tailor, and seized him by the leg.</p>\n<p>“I don’t</p>\n<p>know if you are good to eat or not, but my hunger leaves me no great</p>\n<p>choice.</p>\n<p>I must cut your head off, and roast you.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t do that,” replied the stork; “I am a sacred bird which brings</p>\n<p>mankind great profit, and no one ever does me an injury.</p>\n",
        "<p>Leave me my</p>\n<p>life, and I may do you good in some other way.”</p>\n<p>“Well, be off, Cousin Longlegs,” said the tailor.</p>\n<p>The stork rose up, let its long legs hang down, and flew gently away.</p>\n<p>“What’s to be the end of this?” said the tailor to himself at last; “my</p>\n<p>hunger grows greater and greater, and my stomach more and more empty.</p>\n<p>Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost.”</p>\n",
        "<p>At this moment, he saw a couple of young ducks which were on a pond,</p>\n<p>come swimming toward him.</p>\n<p>“You come just at the right moment,” said he, and laid hold of one of</p>\n<p>them and was about to wring its neck.</p>\n<p>On this an old duck, which was hidden among the reeds, began to scream</p>\n<p>loudly and swam to him with open beak, and begged him urgently to spare</p>\n<p>her dear children.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Can you not imagine,” said she, “how your mother would mourn if any</p>\n<p>one wanted to carry you off, and give you your death blow?”</p>\n<p>“Only be quiet,” said the good-tempered tailor; “you shall keep your</p>\n<p>children,” and he put the prisoner back into the water.</p>\n<p>When he turned round, he was standing in front of an old tree which was</p>\n<p>partly hollow, and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it.</p>\n<p>“There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed,” said the</p>\n",
        "<p>tailor; “the honey will refresh me.”</p>\n<p>But the Queen-Bee came out, threatened him and said, “If you touch my</p>\n<p>people, and destroy my nest, our stings shall pierce your skin like ten</p>\n<p>thousand red-hot needles.</p>\n<p>But if you will leave us in peace and go your</p>\n<p>way, we will do you a service for it another time.”</p>\n<p>The little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Three</p>\n<p>dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner!” He dragged</p>\n<p>himself therefore with his starved-out stomach into the town.</p>\n<p>It was</p>\n<p>just striking twelve, all was ready-cooked for him in the inn, and he</p>\n<p>was able to sit down at once to dinner.</p>\n<p>When he was satisfied, he said, “Now I will get to work.”</p>\n",
        "<p>He went round the town, sought a master, and soon found a good</p>\n<p>situation.</p>\n<p>As he had thoroughly learned his trade, it was not long</p>\n<p>before he became famous, and every one wanted to have a new coat made</p>\n<p>by the little tailor, whose importance increased daily.</p>\n<p>“I can go no further in skill,” said he, “and yet things improve every</p>\n<p>day.”</p>\n",
        "<p>At last the King appointed him court-tailor.</p>\n<p>But how things do happen in the world!</p>\n<p>On the very same day his former</p>\n<p>comrade, the shoemaker, also became court-shoemaker.</p>\n<p>When the latter</p>\n<p>caught sight of the tailor, and saw that he had once more two healthy</p>\n<p>eyes, his conscience troubled him.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Before he takes revenge on me,” thought he to himself, “I must dig a</p>\n<p>pit for him.”</p>\n<p>He, however, who digs a pit for another, falls into it himself.</p>\n<p>In the evening when work was over and it had grown dusk, he stole to</p>\n<p>the King and said, “Lord King, the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has</p>\n<p>boasted that he will get the gold crown back again, which was lost in</p>\n<p>ancient times.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“That would please me very much,” said the King.</p>\n<p>He caused the tailor to be brought before him next morning, and ordered</p>\n<p>him to get the crown back again, or to leave the town for ever.</p>\n<p>“Oho!” thought the tailor, “a rogue gives more than he has got.</p>\n<p>If the</p>\n<p>surly King wants me to do what can be done by no one, I will not wait</p>\n<p>till morning, but will go out of the town at once, to-day.”</p>\n",
        "<p>He packed up his bundle, but when he was without the gate, he could not</p>\n<p>help being sorry to give up his good fortune and turn his back on the</p>\n<p>town in which all had gone so well with him.</p>\n<p>He came to the pond where</p>\n<p>he had made the acquaintance of the ducks.</p>\n<p>At that very moment the old one whose young ones he had spared was</p>\n<p>sitting there by the shore, pluming herself with her beak.</p>\n",
        "<p>She knew him</p>\n<p>again and asked why he was hanging his head.</p>\n<p>“You will not be surprised when you hear what has befallen me,” replied</p>\n<p>the tailor, and told her his fate.</p>\n<p>“If that be all,” said the duck, “we can help you.</p>\n<p>The crown fell into</p>\n<p>the water, and lies at the bottom.</p>\n",
        "<p>We will soon bring it up again for</p>\n<p>you.</p>\n<p>In the meantime just spread out your handkerchief on the bank.”</p>\n<p>She dived down with her twelve young ones.</p>\n<p>And in five minutes she was</p>\n<p>up again with the crown resting on her wings.</p>\n<p>The twelve young ones</p>\n",
        "<p>were swimming round about and had put their beaks under it, and were</p>\n<p>helping to carry it.</p>\n<p>They all swam to the shore and put the crown on</p>\n<p>the handkerchief.</p>\n<p>No one can imagine how magnificent the crown was.</p>\n<p>When the sun shone on</p>\n<p>it, it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles.</p>\n",
        "<p>The tailor tied his</p>\n<p>handkerchief together by the four corners, and carried it to the King,</p>\n<p>who was full of joy, and put a gold chain round the tailor’s neck.</p>\n<p>When the shoemaker saw that one stroke had failed, he contrived a</p>\n<p>second, and went to the King and said, “Lord King, the tailor has</p>\n<p>become insolent again.</p>\n<p>He boasts that he will copy in wax the whole of</p>\n",
        "<p>the royal palace, with everything that pertains to it, loose or fast,</p>\n<p>inside and out.”</p>\n<p>The King sent for the tailor and ordered him to copy in wax the whole</p>\n<p>of the royal palace, with everything that pertained to it, movable</p>\n<p>or immovable, within and without.</p>\n<p>And if he did not succeed in doing</p>\n<p>this, or if so much as one nail on the wall were wanting, he should be</p>\n",
        "<p>imprisoned for his whole life underground.</p>\n<p>The tailor thought, “It gets worse and worse!</p>\n<p>No one can endure that!”</p>\n<p>and threw his bundle on his back, and went forth.</p>\n<p>When he came to the hollow tree, he sat down and hung his head.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>bees came flying out, and the Queen-Bee asked him if he had a stiff</p>\n",
        "<p>neck, since he held his head so awry.</p>\n<p>“Alas, no,” answered the tailor, “something quite different weighs me</p>\n<p>down,” and he told her what the King had demanded of him.</p>\n<p>The bees began to buzz and hum amongst themselves, and the Queen-Bee</p>\n<p>said, “Just go home again.</p>\n<p>But come back to-morrow at this time, and</p>\n<p>bring a large sheet with you, and then all will be well.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So he turned back again, but the bees flew to the royal palace and</p>\n<p>straight into it through the open windows, crept round about into every</p>\n<p>corner, and inspected everything most carefully.</p>\n<p>Then they hurried back and modeled the palace in wax with such rapidity</p>\n<p>that any one looking on would have thought it was growing before his</p>\n<p>eyes.</p>\n<p>By the evening all was ready.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when the tailor came next morning, the whole of the splendid</p>\n<p>building was there, and not one nail in the wall or tile of the roof</p>\n<p>was wanting, and it was delicate withal and white as snow, and smelt</p>\n<p>sweet as honey.</p>\n<p>The tailor wrapped it carefully in his cloth and took it to the King,</p>\n<p>who could not admire it enough, placed it in his largest hall, and in</p>\n<p>return for it presented the tailor with a large stone house.</p>\n",
        "<p>The shoemaker, however, did not give up, but went for the third time to</p>\n<p>the King and said, “Lord King, it has come to the tailor’s ears that</p>\n<p>no water will spring up in the courtyard of the castle.</p>\n<p>He has boasted</p>\n<p>that it shall rise up in the midst of the courtyard to a man’s height</p>\n<p>and be clear as crystal.”</p>\n<p>Then the King ordered the tailor to be brought before him and said,</p>\n",
        "<p>“If a stream of water does not rise in my courtyard by to-morrow as</p>\n<p>you have promised, the executioner shall in that very place make you</p>\n<p>shorter by the head.”</p>\n<p>The poor tailor did not take long to think about it, but hurried out to</p>\n<p>the gate, and because this time it was a matter of life and death to</p>\n<p>him, tears rolled down his face.</p>\n<p>Whilst he was thus going forth full of sorrow, the foal to which he</p>\n",
        "<p>had formerly given its liberty, and which had now become a beautiful</p>\n<p>chestnut horse, came leaping toward him.</p>\n<p>“The time has come,” it said to the tailor, “when I can repay you for</p>\n<p>your good deed.</p>\n<p>I know already what is needful to you, but you shall</p>\n<p>soon have help.</p>\n<p>Get on me, my back can carry two such as you.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The tailor’s courage came back to him.</p>\n<p>He jumped up in one bound; and</p>\n<p>the horse went full speed into the town, and right up to the courtyard</p>\n<p>of the castle.</p>\n<p>It galloped as quick as lightning thrice round it, and</p>\n<p>at the third time it fell violently down.</p>\n<p>At the same instant there was</p>\n",
        "<p>a terrific clap of thunder, a fragment of earth in the middle of the</p>\n<p>courtyard sprang like a cannon ball into the air, and over the castle.</p>\n<p>Directly after it, a jet of water rose as high as a man on horseback,</p>\n<p>and the water was as pure as crystal, and the sunbeams began to dance</p>\n<p>on it.</p>\n<p>When the King saw that he arose in amazement, and went and embraced the</p>\n<p>tailor in the sight of all men.</p>\n",
        "<p>But good fortune did not last long.</p>\n<p>The King had daughters in plenty,</p>\n<p>each one prettier than the other, but he had no son.</p>\n<p>So the malicious shoemaker betook himself for the fourth time to the</p>\n<p>King, and said, “Lord King, the tailor has not given up his arrogance.</p>\n<p>He has now boasted that if he liked, he could cause a son to be brought</p>\n<p>to the Lord King through the air.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The King commanded the tailor to be summoned, and said, “If you cause</p>\n<p>a son to be brought to me within nine days, you shall have my eldest</p>\n<p>daughter to wife.”</p>\n<p>“The reward is indeed great,” thought the little tailor.</p>\n<p>“One would</p>\n<p>willingly do something for it, but the cherries grow too high for me.</p>\n<p>If I climb for them, the bough will break beneath me, and I shall fall.”</p>\n",
        "<p>He went home, seated himself cross-legged on his work-table, and</p>\n<p>thought over what was to be done.</p>\n<p>“It can’t be managed,” cried he at last.</p>\n<p>“I will go away.</p>\n<p>After all I</p>\n<p>can’t live in peace here.”</p>\n<p>He tied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he got to the</p>\n<p>meadow, he perceived his old friend the stork, who was walking backward</p>\n<p>and forward like a philosopher.</p>\n<p>Sometimes he stood still, took a frog</p>\n<p>into close consideration, and at length swallowed it down.</p>\n<p>The stork came to him and greeted him.</p>\n<p>“I see,” he began, “that you</p>\n",
        "<p>have your pack on your back.</p>\n<p>Why are you leaving the town?”</p>\n<p>The tailor told him what the King had required of him, and how he could</p>\n<p>not perform it, and lamented his misfortune.</p>\n<p>“Don’t let your hair grow gray about that,” said the stork.</p>\n<p>“I will</p>\n<p>help you out of your difficulty.</p>\n",
        "<p>For a long time past, I have carried</p>\n<p>the children in swaddling-clothes into the town.</p>\n<p>So for once, I can</p>\n<p>fetch a little Prince out of the well.</p>\n<p>Go home and be easy.</p>\n<p>In nine</p>\n<p>days from this time repair to the royal palace, and there will I come.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The little tailor went home, and at the appointed time was at the</p>\n<p>castle.</p>\n<p>It was not long before the stork came flying thither and tapped</p>\n<p>at the window.</p>\n<p>The tailor opened it, and Cousin Longlegs came carefully</p>\n<p>in, and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble pavement.</p>\n<p>He had a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an angel, and stretched</p>\n",
        "<p>out its little hands to the Queen.</p>\n<p>The stork laid it in her lap, and</p>\n<p>she caressed it and kissed it, and was beside herself with delight.</p>\n<p>Before the stork flew away he took his traveling bag off his back and</p>\n<p>handed it over to the Queen.</p>\n<p>In it there were little paper parcels</p>\n<p>full of colored sweetmeats, and they were divided amongst the little</p>\n",

        "<h3>JORINDA AND JORINGEL</h3>\n<p>There was once an old castle in the midst of a large and thick forest,</p>\n<p>and in it an old woman, who was a Witch, dwelt all alone.</p>\n<p>In the daytime, she changed herself into a cat or a screech-owl, but</p>\n<p>in the evening she took her proper shape again as a human being.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>could lure wild beasts and birds to her, then she killed and boiled and</p>\n",
        "<p>roasted them.</p>\n<p>If any one came within one hundred paces of the castle he was obliged</p>\n<p>to stand still, and could not stir from the place until she bade him</p>\n<p>be free.</p>\n<p>But whenever an innocent maiden came within this circle, she</p>\n<p>changed her into a bird, shut her up in a wicker-work cage, and carried</p>\n<p>the cage into a room in the castle.</p>\n",
        "<p>She had about seven thousand cages</p>\n<p>of rare birds in the castle.</p>\n<p>Now, there was once a maiden who was called Jorinda, who was fairer</p>\n<p>than all other girls.</p>\n<p>She and a handsome youth named Joringel had</p>\n<p>promised to marry each other, and their greatest happiness was being</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n",
        "<p>One day, in order that they might be able to talk together in quiet,</p>\n<p>they went for a walk in the forest.</p>\n<p>“Take care,” said Joringel, “that you do not go too near the castle.”</p>\n<p>It was a beautiful evening.</p>\n<p>The sun shone brightly between the trunks</p>\n<p>of the trees into the dark green of the forest, and the turtledoves</p>\n<p>sang mournfully upon the young boughs of the birch-trees.</p>\n",
        "<p>Jorinda wept now and then.</p>\n<p>She sat down in the sunshine and was</p>\n<p>sorrowful.</p>\n<p>Joringel was sorrowful too.</p>\n<p>They were as sad as if they were</p>\n<p>about to die.</p>\n<p>Then they looked around them, and were quite at a loss,</p>\n",
        "<p>for they did not know by which way to go home.</p>\n<p>The sun was half above</p>\n<p>the mountain and half set.</p>\n<p>Joringel looked through the bushes, and saw the old walls of the castle</p>\n<p>close at hand.</p>\n<p>He was horror-stricken and filled with deadly fear.</p>\n<p>Jorinda was singing:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_My little Bird, with the necklace red,</p>\n<p>Sings sorrow, sorrow, sorrow,</p>\n<p>He sings that the Dove must soon be dead,</p>\n<p>Sings sorrow, sor----jug, jug, jug!_”</p>\n<p>Joringel looked for Jorinda.</p>\n<p>She was changed into a Nightingale, and</p>\n<p>sang “_jug, jug, jug!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>A screech-owl with glowing eyes flew three times round about her, and</p>\n<p>three times cried, “_to-whoo, to-whoo, to-whoo!_”</p>\n<p>Joringel could not move.</p>\n<p>He stood there like a stone, and could neither</p>\n<p>weep nor speak, nor move hand or foot.</p>\n<p>The sun had now set.</p>\n<p>The owl flew into the thicket.</p>\n",
        "<p>Directly afterward</p>\n<p>there came out of it a crooked Old Woman, yellow and lean, with large</p>\n<p>red eyes and a hooked nose, the point of which reached to her chin.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>muttered to herself, caught the Nightingale, and took it away in her</p>\n<p>hand.</p>\n<p>Joringel could neither speak nor move from the spot.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Nightingale</p>\n<p>was gone.</p>\n<p>At last the woman came back, and said in a hollow voice, “Greet thee,</p>\n<p>Zachiel.</p>\n<p>If the moon shines on the cage, Zachiel, let him loose at</p>\n<p>once.”</p>\n<p>Then Joringel was freed.</p>\n",
        "<p>He fell on his knees before the woman and</p>\n<p>begged that she would give him back his Jorinda.</p>\n<p>But she said that he</p>\n<p>should never have her again, and went away.</p>\n<p>He called, he wept.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>lamented, but all in vain, “Ah, what is to become of me?”</p>\n",
        "<p>Joringel went away, and at last came to a strange village.</p>\n<p>There he</p>\n<p>kept sheep for a long time.</p>\n<p>He often walked round and round the castle,</p>\n<p>but not too near to it.</p>\n<p>One night he dreamt that he found a Blood-Red</p>\n<p>Flower, in the middle of which was a beautiful large pearl; that he</p>\n",
        "<p>picked the flower and went with it to the castle, and that everything</p>\n<p>he touched with the flower was freed from enchantment.</p>\n<p>He also dreamt</p>\n<p>that by means of it, he recovered his Jorinda.</p>\n<p>In the morning, when he awoke, he began to seek over hill and dale to</p>\n<p>find such a flower.</p>\n<p>He sought until the ninth day, and then, early in</p>\n",
        "<p>the morning, he found the Blood-Red Flower.</p>\n<p>In the middle of it, there</p>\n<p>was a large dew-drop, as big as the finest pearl.</p>\n<p>Day and night, he journeyed with this flower to the castle.</p>\n<p>When he</p>\n<p>was within a hundred paces of it he was not held fast, but walked on to</p>\n<p>the door.</p>\n",
        "<p>Joringel was full of joy.</p>\n<p>He touched the door with the flower, and it</p>\n<p>sprang open.</p>\n<p>He walked in through the courtyard, and listened for the</p>\n<p>sound of the birds.</p>\n<p>At last he heard it.</p>\n<p>He went on, and found the room</p>\n",
        "<p>from whence it came.</p>\n<p>There the Witch was feeding the birds in the seven</p>\n<p>thousand cages.</p>\n<p>When she saw Joringel, she was angry, very angry, and scolded and spat</p>\n<p>poison and gall, but she could not come within two paces of him.</p>\n<p>He did</p>\n<p>not take any notice of her, but went and looked at the cages with the</p>\n",

        "<p>in war, and behaved well and bravely, but when the war was over he</p>\n<p>received his dismissal, and three farthings for his expenses on the</p>\n<p>way.</p>\n<p>“Stop,” said he, “I shall not be content with this.</p>\n<p>If I can but</p>\n<p>meet with the right people, the King will have to give me all the</p>\n<p>treasure of the country.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then full of anger he went into the forest, and saw a man standing</p>\n<p>therein who had plucked up six trees as if they were blades of corn.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>said to him, “Will you be my servant and go with me?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” he answered, “but, first, I will take this little bundle of</p>\n<p>sticks home to my mother,” and he took one of the trees, and wrapped</p>\n<p>it round the five others, lifted the bundle on his back and carried it</p>\n",
        "<p>away.</p>\n<p>Then he returned and went with his master, who said, “We two ought to</p>\n<p>be able to get through the world very well.”</p>\n<p>When they had walked on for a short while they found a huntsman who was</p>\n<p>kneeling, had shouldered his gun, and was about to fire.</p>\n<p>The master</p>\n<p>said to him, “Huntsman, what are you going to shoot?”</p>\n",
        "<p>He answered, “Two miles from here a fly is sitting on the branch of an</p>\n<p>oak-tree, and I want to shoot its left eye out.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, come with me,” said the man, “if we three are together, we</p>\n<p>certainly ought to be able to get on in the world!”</p>\n<p>The huntsman was ready, and went with him.</p>\n<p>They came to seven windmills whose sails were turning round with great</p>\n<p>speed, and yet no wind was blowing either on the right or the left, and</p>\n",
        "<p>no leaf was stirring.</p>\n<p>Then said the man, “I know not what is driving</p>\n<p>the windmills, not a breath of air is stirring,” and he went onward</p>\n<p>with his servants, and when they had walked two miles they saw a man</p>\n<p>sitting on a tree, who was shutting one nostril, and blowing out of the</p>\n<p>other.</p>\n<p>“Good gracious!</p>\n",
        "<p>what are you doing up there?”</p>\n<p>He answered, “Two miles from here are seven windmills.</p>\n<p>Look, I am</p>\n<p>blowing them till they turn round.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, come with me,” said the man.</p>\n<p>“If we four are together, we shall</p>\n<p>carry the whole world before us!”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the blower came down and went with him.</p>\n<p>After a while they saw a man who was standing on one leg and had taken</p>\n<p>off the other, and laid it beside him.</p>\n<p>Then the master said, “You have</p>\n<p>arranged things very comfortably to have a rest.”</p>\n<p>“I am a runner,” he replied, “and to stop myself running far too fast,</p>\n<p>I have taken off one of my legs, for if I run with both, I go quicker</p>\n",
        "<p>than any bird can fly.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, come with me.</p>\n<p>If we five are together, we shall carry the whole</p>\n<p>world before us.”</p>\n<p>So he went with them.</p>\n<p>It was not long before they met a man who wore a cap, but had put it</p>\n<p>quite on one ear.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the master said to him, “Gracefully!</p>\n<p>gracefully!</p>\n<p>don’t stick your cap on one ear, you look just like a tom-fool!”</p>\n<p>“I must not wear it otherwise,” said he, “for if I set my hat straight,</p>\n<p>a terrible frost comes on, and all the birds in the air are frozen, and</p>\n<p>drop dead on the ground.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, come with me,” said the master.</p>\n",
        "<p>“If we six are together, we can</p>\n<p>carry the whole world before us.”</p>\n<p>Now the six came to a town where the King had proclaimed that whosoever</p>\n<p>ran a race with his daughter and won the victory, should be her</p>\n<p>husband, but whosoever lost it, must lose his head.</p>\n<p>Then the man presented himself and said, “I will, however, let my</p>\n<p>servant run for me.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The King replied, “Then his life also must be staked, so that his head</p>\n<p>and thine are both set on the victory.”</p>\n<p>When that was settled and made secure, the man buckled the other leg on</p>\n<p>the runner, and said to him, “Now be nimble, and help us to win.”</p>\n<p>It was fixed that the one who was the first to bring some water from a</p>\n<p>far distant well, was to be the victor.</p>\n<p>The runner received a pitcher,</p>\n",
        "<p>and the King’s Daughter one too, and they began to run at the same</p>\n<p>time.</p>\n<p>But in an instant, when the King’s Daughter had got a very little</p>\n<p>way, the people who were looking on could see no more of the runner, it</p>\n<p>was just as if the wind had whistled by.</p>\n<p>In a short time he reached the well, filled his pitcher with water,</p>\n<p>and turned back.</p>\n",
        "<p>Half-way home, however, he was overcome with fatigue,</p>\n<p>and set his pitcher down, lay down himself, and fell asleep.</p>\n<p>He had,</p>\n<p>however, made a pillow of a horse’s skull which was lying on the</p>\n<p>ground, in order that he might lie uncomfortably, and soon wake up</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the King’s Daughter, who could also run very</p>\n",
        "<p>well--quite as well as any ordinary mortal can--had reached the well,</p>\n<p>and was hurrying back with her pitcher full of water, and when she saw</p>\n<p>the runner lying there asleep, she was glad and said, “My enemy is</p>\n<p>delivered over into my hands,” emptied his pitcher, and ran on.</p>\n<p>And now all would have been lost if by good luck the huntsman had not</p>\n<p>been standing at the top of the castle, and had not seen everything</p>\n<p>with his sharp eyes.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then said he, “The King’s Daughter shall still not</p>\n<p>prevail against us.”</p>\n<p>He loaded his gun, and shot so cleverly, that he shot the horse’s</p>\n<p>skull away from under the runner’s head without hurting him.</p>\n<p>Then the</p>\n<p>runner awoke, leapt up, and saw that his pitcher was empty, and that</p>\n<p>the King’s Daughter was already far in advance.</p>\n",
        "<p>He did not lose heart,</p>\n<p>however, but ran back to the well with his pitcher, again drew some</p>\n<p>water, and was still at home again, ten minutes before the King’s</p>\n<p>Daughter.</p>\n<p>“Behold!” said he, “I have not bestirred myself till now.</p>\n<p>It</p>\n<p>did not deserve to be called running before.”</p>\n",
        "<p>But it pained the King, and still more his daughter, that she should</p>\n<p>be carried off by a common disbanded soldier like that.</p>\n<p>So they took</p>\n<p>counsel with each other how to get rid of him and his companions.</p>\n<p>Then said the King to her, “I have thought of a way.</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid,</p>\n<p>they shall not come back again.” And he said to them, “You shall now</p>\n",
        "<p>make merry together, and eat and drink.”</p>\n<p>He conducted them to a room which had a floor of iron, and the doors</p>\n<p>also were of iron, and the windows were guarded with iron bars.</p>\n<p>There</p>\n<p>was a table in the room covered with delicious food, and the King said</p>\n<p>to them, “Go in, and enjoy yourselves.”</p>\n<p>And when they were inside, he ordered the doors to be shut and bolted.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he sent for the cook, and commanded him to make a fire under the</p>\n<p>room until the iron became red-hot.</p>\n<p>This the cook did, and the six who</p>\n<p>were sitting at table began to feel quite warm, and they thought the</p>\n<p>heat was caused by the food.</p>\n<p>But as it became still greater, and they</p>\n<p>wanted to get out, and found that the doors and windows were bolted,</p>\n",
        "<p>they became aware that the King had an evil intention, and wanted to</p>\n<p>suffocate them.</p>\n<p>“He shall not succeed, however,” said the one with the cap.</p>\n<p>“I will</p>\n<p>cause a frost to come, before which the fire shall be ashamed, and</p>\n<p>creep away.”</p>\n<p>Then he put his cap on straight, and immediately there came such a</p>\n",
        "<p>frost that all heat disappeared, and the food on the dishes began to</p>\n<p>freeze.</p>\n<p>When an hour or two had passed by, and the King believed that they had</p>\n<p>perished in the heat, he had the doors opened to behold them himself.</p>\n<p>But when the doors were opened, all six were standing there, alive</p>\n<p>and well, and said that they should very much like to get out to warm</p>\n<p>themselves, for the very food was fast frozen to the dishes with the</p>\n",
        "<p>cold.</p>\n<p>Then, full of anger, the King went down to the cook, scolded him and</p>\n<p>asked why he had not done what he had been ordered to do.</p>\n<p>But the</p>\n<p>cook replied, “There is heat enough there, just look yourself.” Then</p>\n<p>the King saw that a fierce fire was burning under the iron room, and</p>\n<p>perceived that there was no getting the better of the six in this way.</p>\n",
        "<p>Again the King considered how to get rid of his unpleasant guests, and</p>\n<p>caused their chief to be brought and said, “If you will take gold and</p>\n<p>renounce my daughter, you shall have as much as you wish.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, Lord King,” he answered, “give me as much as my servant can</p>\n<p>carry, and I will not ask for your daughter.”</p>\n<p>On this the King was satisfied, and the other continued, “In fourteen</p>\n<p>days, I will come and fetch it.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Thereupon he summoned together all the tailors in the whole kingdom,</p>\n<p>and they were to sit for fourteen days and sew a sack.</p>\n<p>And when it was</p>\n<p>ready, the strong one who could tear up trees had to take it on his</p>\n<p>back, and go with it to the King.</p>\n<p>Then said the King, “Who can that strong fellow be who is carrying a</p>\n<p>bundle of linen on his back that is as big as a house?” and he was</p>\n",
        "<p>alarmed and said, “What a lot of gold he can carry away!”</p>\n<p>Then he commanded a ton of gold to be brought.</p>\n<p>It took sixteen of his</p>\n<p>strongest men to carry it, but the strong one snatched it up in one</p>\n<p>hand, put it in his sack, and said, “Why don’t you bring more at the</p>\n<p>same time?--that hardly covers the bottom!”</p>\n<p>Then, little by little, the King caused all his treasure to be brought</p>\n",
        "<p>thither, and the strong one pushed it into the sack, and still the sack</p>\n<p>was not half full with it.</p>\n<p>“Bring more,” cried he, “these few crumbs</p>\n<p>don’t fill it.”</p>\n<p>Then seven thousand carts with gold had to be gathered together in the</p>\n<p>whole kingdom, and the strong one thrust them and the oxen harnessed to</p>\n<p>them into his sack.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I will examine it no longer,” said he, “but will</p>\n<p>just take what comes, so long as the sack is but full.”</p>\n<p>When all that was inside, there was still room for a great deal</p>\n<p>more.</p>\n<p>Then he said, “I will just make an end of the thing.</p>\n<p>People do</p>\n<p>sometimes tie up a sack even when it is not full.” So he took it on his</p>\n",
        "<p>back, and went away with his comrades.</p>\n<p>When the King now saw how one single man was carrying away the entire</p>\n<p>wealth of the country, he became enraged, and bade his horsemen mount</p>\n<p>and pursue the six, and ordered them to take the sack away from the</p>\n<p>strong one.</p>\n<p>Two regiments speedily overtook the six, and called out,</p>\n<p>“You are prisoners.</p>\n",
        "<p>Put down the sack with the gold, or you will all be</p>\n<p>cut to pieces!”</p>\n<p>“What say you?” cried the blower, “that we are prisoners!</p>\n<p>Rather than</p>\n<p>that should happen, all of you shall dance about in the air.” And he</p>\n<p>closed one nostril, and with the other blew on the two regiments.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n",
        "<p>they were driven away from each other, and carried into the blue sky</p>\n<p>over all the mountains--one here, the other there.</p>\n<p>One sergeant cried for mercy.</p>\n<p>He had nine wounds, and was a brave</p>\n<p>fellow who did not deserve ill-treatment.</p>\n<p>The blower stopped a little</p>\n<p>so that he came down without injury, and then the blower said to him,</p>\n",
        "<p>“Now go home to your King, and tell him he had better send some more</p>\n<p>horsemen, and I will blow them all into the air.”</p>\n<p>When the King was informed of this he said, “Let the rascals go.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>have the best of it.”</p>\n<p>Then the six conveyed the riches home, divided it amongst them, and</p>\n<p>lived in content until their death.</p>\n",
        "<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE GOOSE-GIRL</h3>\n<p>There was once upon a time, an old Queen, whose husband had been dead</p>\n<p>for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter.</p>\n<p>When the Princess grew up, she was betrothed to a Prince who lived very</p>\n<p>far away.</p>\n<p>When the time came for her to be married, and she had to</p>\n",
        "<p>journey forth into the distant kingdom, the aged Queen packed up for</p>\n<p>her many costly vessels of silver and gold, and trinkets, also of gold</p>\n<p>and silver, and cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained</p>\n<p>to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart.</p>\n<p>She likewise sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to ride with her, and</p>\n<p>hand her over to the Bridegroom.</p>\n<p>Each had a horse for the journey, but</p>\n",
        "<p>the horse of the King’s Daughter was called Falada, and could speak.</p>\n<p>So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother went into her</p>\n<p>bedroom, took a small knife and cut her finger with it until it bled.</p>\n<p>Then she held a white handkerchief to it, into which she let three</p>\n<p>drops of blood fall.</p>\n<p>She gave the handkerchief to her daughter and said, “Dear Child,</p>\n<p>preserve this carefully.</p>\n",
        "<p>It will be of service to you on your way.”</p>\n<p>So they took a sorrowful leave of each other.</p>\n<p>The Princess put the</p>\n<p>piece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away to</p>\n<p>her Bridegroom.</p>\n<p>After she had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst, and said</p>\n<p>to her waiting-maid, “Dismount, and take my cup which you have brought</p>\n",
        "<p>with you, and get me some water from the stream, for I should like to</p>\n<p>drink.”</p>\n<p>“If you are thirsty,” said the waiting-maid, “get off your horse</p>\n<p>yourself, and lie down and drink out of the water.</p>\n<p>I don’t choose to be</p>\n<p>your servant.”</p>\n<p>So in her great thirst the Princess alighted, bent down over the water</p>\n",
        "<p>in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden</p>\n<p>cup.</p>\n<p>Then she said, “Ah, Heaven!” and the three drops of blood answered:</p>\n<p>“_If thy Mother only knew,</p>\n<p>’Twould surely break her heart in two!_”</p>\n<p>But the King’s Daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horse</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n",
        "<p>She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sun scorched</p>\n<p>her, and she was thirsty once more.</p>\n<p>When they came to a stream of</p>\n<p>water, she again cried to her waiting-maid, “Dismount, and give me some</p>\n<p>water in my golden cup,” for she had long ago forgotten the girl’s ill</p>\n<p>words.</p>\n<p>But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily, “If you wish to drink,</p>\n",
        "<p>drink as you can, I don’t choose to be your maid.”</p>\n<p>Then in her great thirst the King’s Daughter alighted, bent over the</p>\n<p>flowing stream, wept and said, “Ah, Heaven!” and the drops of blood</p>\n<p>again replied:</p>\n<p>“_If thy Mother only knew,</p>\n<p>’Twould surely break her heart in two!_”</p>\n<p>And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, the</p>\n",
        "<p>handkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, and</p>\n<p>floated away with the water without her observing it, so great was her</p>\n<p>trouble.</p>\n<p>The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to</p>\n<p>think that she had now power over the Bride, for since the Princess had</p>\n<p>lost the drops of blood, she had become weak and powerless.</p>\n<p>So now, when she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was</p>\n",
        "<p>called Falada, the waiting-maid said, “Falada is more suitable for me,</p>\n<p>and my nag will do for you,” and the Princess had to be content with</p>\n<p>that.</p>\n<p>Then the waiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the Princess exchange</p>\n<p>her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes; and at length she was</p>\n<p>compelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not say</p>\n<p>one word of this to any one at the Royal Court.</p>\n",
        "<p>And if she had not</p>\n<p>taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot.</p>\n<p>But Falada saw</p>\n<p>all this, and observed it well.</p>\n<p>The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the true Bride the bad horse,</p>\n<p>and thus they traveled onward, until they entered the royal palace.</p>\n<p>There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the Prince sprang</p>\n",
        "<p>forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, and</p>\n<p>thought she was his Bride.</p>\n<p>She was conducted up-stairs, but the real</p>\n<p>Princess was left standing below.</p>\n<p>Then the old King looked out of the window and saw her standing in</p>\n<p>the courtyard, and how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n",
        "<p>instantly went to the royal apartment, and asked the Bride about the</p>\n<p>girl she had with her, who was standing down below in the courtyard,</p>\n<p>and who she was.</p>\n<p>“I picked her up on my way for a companion.</p>\n<p>Give the girl something to</p>\n<p>work at, that she may not stand idle.”</p>\n<p>But the old King had no work for her, and knew of none, so he said, “I</p>\n",
        "<p>have a little boy who tends the geese, she may help him.”</p>\n<p>The boy was called Conrad, and the true Bride had to help him to tend</p>\n<p>the geese.</p>\n<p>Soon afterward the false Bride said to the young King, “Dearest</p>\n<p>Husband, I beg you to do me a favor.”</p>\n<p>He answered, “I will do so most willingly.”</p>\n<p>“Then send for the butcher, and have the head of the horse on which I</p>\n",
        "<p>rode here, cut off, for it vexed me on the way.” In reality, she was</p>\n<p>afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the King’s</p>\n<p>Daughter.</p>\n<p>Then she succeeded in making the King promise that it should be done,</p>\n<p>and the faithful Falada was to die.</p>\n<p>This came to the ears of the real</p>\n<p>Princess, and she secretly promised the butcher a piece of gold if he</p>\n",
        "<p>would perform a small service for her.</p>\n<p>There was a great dark-looking</p>\n<p>gateway in the town, through which, morning and evening, she had to</p>\n<p>pass with the geese: would he be so good as to nail up Falada’s head on</p>\n<p>it, so that she might see him again?</p>\n<p>The butcher promised to do that,</p>\n<p>and cut off the head, and nailed it fast beneath the dark gateway.</p>\n",
        "<p>Early in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneath</p>\n<p>this gateway, she said in passing:</p>\n<p>“_Alas, Falada, hanging there!_”</p>\n<p>Then the head answered:</p>\n<p>“_Alas!</p>\n<p>young Queen, how ill you fare!</p>\n<p>If this your tender Mother knew,</p>\n",
        "<p>Her heart would surely break in two!_”</p>\n<p>Then they went still farther out of the town, and drove their geese</p>\n<p>into the country.</p>\n<p>And when they had come to the meadow, she sat down</p>\n<p>and unbound her hair which was like pure gold.</p>\n<p>Conrad saw it and</p>\n<p>delighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then</p>\n<p>she said:</p>\n<p>“_Blow, blow, thou gentle Wind, I say,</p>\n<p>Blow Conrad’s little hat away,</p>\n<p>And make him chase it here and there,</p>\n<p>Until I’ve braided all my hair,</p>\n<p>And bound it up again._”</p>\n",
        "<p>And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad’s hat far away</p>\n<p>across county, and he was forced to run after it.</p>\n<p>When he came back she had finished combing her hair and was putting</p>\n<p>it up again and he could not get any of it.</p>\n<p>Then Conrad was angry,</p>\n<p>and would not speak to her.</p>\n<p>And thus they watched the geese until the</p>\n",
        "<p>evening, and then they went home.</p>\n<p>[Illustration: THE HEAD ANSWERED, “ALAS!</p>\n<h3>YOUNG QUEEN HOW ILL YOU FARE”]</h3>\n<p>Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway,</p>\n<p>the maiden said:</p>\n<p>“_Alas, Falada, hanging there!_”</p>\n<p>Falada answered:</p>\n"

        "<p>been put up a long time, and he could get none of it.</p>\n<p>So they looked</p>\n<p>after their geese till evening came.</p>\n<p>But in the evening, after they had got home, Conrad went to the old</p>\n<p>King, and said, “I won’t tend the geese with that girl any longer!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” inquired the old King.</p>\n<p>“Oh, because she vexes me the whole day long.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the old King commanded him to relate what it was that she did to</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>And Conrad said, “In the morning, when we pass beneath the dark gateway</p>\n<p>with the flock, there is a sorry horse’s head on the wall, and she says</p>\n<p>to it:</p>\n<p>“‘_Alas, Falada, hanging there!_’</p>\n<p>And the head replies:</p>\n",

        "<p>shone with radiance.</p>\n<p>And soon she said:</p>\n<p>“_Blow, blow, thou gentle Wind, I say,</p>\n<p>Blow Conrad’s little hat away,</p>\n<p>And make him chase it here and there,</p>\n<p>Until I’ve braided all my hair,</p>\n<p>And bound it up again._”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad’s hat, so that he had</p>\n<p>to run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaiting</p>\n<p>her hair.</p>\n<p>All of which the King observed.</p>\n<p>Then, quite unseen, he went away, and when the goose-girl came home</p>\n<p>in the evening, he called her aside, and asked why she did all these</p>\n<p>things.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I may not tell you that, and I dare not lament my sorrows to any human</p>\n<p>being, for I have sworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me.</p>\n<p>If I had not done that, I should have lost my life.”</p>\n<p>He urged her and left her no peace, but he could draw nothing from her.</p>\n<p>Then said he, “If you will not tell me anything, tell your sorrows to</p>\n<p>the iron stove there,” and he went away.</p>\n<p>Then she crept into the iron stove, and began to weep and lament, and</p>\n",
        "<p>emptied her whole heart, and said, “Here am I deserted by the whole</p>\n<p>world, and yet I am a King’s Daughter, and a false waiting-maid has by</p>\n<p>force brought me to such a pass, that I have been compelled to put off</p>\n<p>my royal apparel.</p>\n<p>She has taken my place with my Bridegroom, and I have</p>\n<p>to do the mean work of a goose-girl.</p>\n<p>“_If my Mother only knew,</p>\n",
        "<p>’Twould surely break her heart in two!_”</p>\n<p>The old King was standing outside by the pipe of the stove, and was</p>\n<p>listening to what she said, and heard it.</p>\n<p>Then he came back again,</p>\n<p>and bade her come out of the stove.</p>\n<p>And royal garments were placed on</p>\n<p>her, and it was marvelous how beautiful she was!</p>\n",
        "<p>The old King called</p>\n<p>his son, and revealed to him, that he had got the false Bride who was</p>\n<p>only a waiting-maid, but that the true one was standing there, as the</p>\n<p>goose-girl.</p>\n<p>The young King rejoiced with all his heart when he saw her beauty and</p>\n<p>youth, and a great feast was made ready to which all the people and all</p>\n<p>good friends were invited.</p>\n",
        "<p>At the head of the table sat the Bridegroom</p>\n<p>with the King’s Daughter at one side of him, and the waiting-maid on</p>\n<p>the other, but the waiting-maid was blinded, and did not recognize the</p>\n<p>Princess in her dazzling array.</p>\n<p>When they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the old King asked the</p>\n<p>waiting-maid as a riddle, what a person deserved who had behaved in</p>\n<p>such and such a way to her master, and at the same time related the</p>\n",
        "<p>whole story, and asked what sentence such a one merited?</p>\n<p>Then the false Bride said, “She deserves no better fate than to be put</p>\n<p>in a barrel which is studded inside with pointed nails, and two white</p>\n<p>horses should be harnessed to it, to drag her along through one street</p>\n<p>after another, till she is dead.”</p>\n<p>“It is you,” said the old King, “and you have pronounced your own</p>\n<p>sentence.</p>\n",

        "<p>three, and set out.</p>\n<p>Now, when the time had come for him to return home, he had brought</p>\n<p>pearls and diamonds for the two eldest.</p>\n<p>But he had sought everywhere</p>\n<p>in vain for a Singing, Soaring Lark for the youngest, and he was very</p>\n<p>unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child.</p>\n<p>Then his road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a</p>\n",
        "<p>splendid castle.</p>\n<p>Near the castle stood a tree, and quite on the top of</p>\n<p>the tree, he saw a Singing, Soaring Lark.</p>\n<p>“Aha, you come just at the right moment!” he said, quite delighted, and</p>\n<p>called to his servant to climb up and catch the little creature.</p>\n<p>But as he approached the tree, a Lion leapt from beneath it, shook</p>\n<p>himself, and roared till the leaves on the tree trembled.</p>\n",
        "<p>“He who tries</p>\n<p>to steal my Singing, Soaring Lark,” he cried, “will I devour.”</p>\n<p>Then the man said, “I did not know that the bird belonged to you.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>will make amends for the wrong I have done, and ransom myself with a</p>\n<p>large sum of money, only spare my life.”</p>\n<p>The Lion said, “Nothing can save you, unless you will promise to give</p>\n",
        "<p>me for mine own what first meets you on your return home.</p>\n<p>But if you</p>\n<p>will do that, I will grant you your life, and you shall have the bird</p>\n<p>for your daughter, into the bargain.”</p>\n<p>The man hesitated and said, “That might be my youngest daughter, she</p>\n<p>loves me best, and always runs to meet me on my return home.”</p>\n<p>The servant, however, was terrified and said, “Why should your daughter</p>\n",
        "<p>be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or dog?”</p>\n<p>Then the man allowed himself to be persuaded, took the Singing, Soaring</p>\n<p>Lark, and promised to give the Lion whatsoever should first meet him on</p>\n<p>his return home.</p>\n<p>When he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was</p>\n<p>no other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up,</p>\n<p>kissed and embraced him.</p>\n",
        "<p>When she saw that he had brought with him a</p>\n<p>Singing, Soaring Lark, she was beside herself with joy.</p>\n<p>The father, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said,</p>\n<p>“My dearest Child, I have bought the little bird at a great cost!</p>\n<p>In</p>\n<p>return for it, I have been obliged to promise you to a savage Lion.</p>\n<p>When he has you he will tear you in pieces and devour you,” and he told</p>\n",
        "<p>her all, just as it had happened, and begged her not to go thither,</p>\n<p>come what might.</p>\n<p>But she consoled him and said, “Dearest Father, indeed your promise</p>\n<p>must be fulfilled.</p>\n<p>I will go thither and soften the Lion, so that I may</p>\n<p>return to you safely.”</p>\n<p>Next morning, she had the road pointed out to her, took leave, and went</p>\n",
        "<p>fearlessly out into the forest.</p>\n<p>The Lion, however, was an enchanted</p>\n<p>Prince and was by day a Lion, and all his people were Lions with him.</p>\n<p>But in the night, they resumed their natural human shapes.</p>\n<p>On her arrival, she was kindly received and led into the castle.</p>\n<p>When</p>\n<p>night came, the Lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding</p>\n",
        "<p>was celebrated with great magnificence.</p>\n<p>They lived happily together,</p>\n<p>remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime.</p>\n<p>One day, he came and said, “To-morrow there is a feast in your father’s</p>\n<p>house, because your eldest sister is to be married, and if you are</p>\n<p>inclined to go there, my Lions shall conduct you.”</p>\n<p>She said, “Yes, I should very much like to see my father again,” and</p>\n",
        "<p>went thither, accompanied by the Lions.</p>\n<p>There was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that</p>\n<p>she had been torn in pieces by the Lion, and had long ceased to live.</p>\n<p>But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she</p>\n<p>was.</p>\n<p>She remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then</p>\n<p>went back again to the forest.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again</p>\n<p>invited to the wedding, she said to the Lion, “This time, I will not go</p>\n<p>alone.</p>\n<p>You must come with me.”</p>\n<p>The Lion, however, said that it was too dangerous for him, for if a ray</p>\n<p>from a burning candle should fall on him, he would be changed into a</p>\n<p>Dove, and for seven years long would have to fly about with the Doves.</p>\n",
        "<p>She said, “Ah, but do come with me, I will take great care of you and</p>\n<p>guard you from all light.”</p>\n<p>So they went away together, and took with them their little child as</p>\n<p>well.</p>\n<p>She had a chamber built, so strong and thick that no ray could</p>\n<p>pierce through it.</p>\n<p>In this he was to shut himself up when the candles</p>\n",
        "<p>were lit for the wedding-feast.</p>\n<p>But the door was made of green wood</p>\n<p>which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed.</p>\n<p>The wedding was celebrated with magnificence; but when the procession</p>\n<p>with all its candles and torches came back from church and passed by</p>\n<p>this apartment, a ray about the breadth of a hair fell on the King’s</p>\n<p>Son.</p>\n",
        "<p>When this ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when she came in, and looked for him, she did not see him, but a white</p>\n<p>Dove was sitting there.</p>\n<p>The Dove said to her, “For seven years must I fly about the world, but</p>\n<p>at every seventh step that you take I will let fall a drop of red blood</p>\n<p>and a white feather.</p>\n",
        "<p>These will show you the way.</p>\n<p>If you follow the</p>\n<p>trace you can release me.”</p>\n<p>Thereupon the Dove flew out at the door, and she followed him.</p>\n<p>At every</p>\n<p>seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather fell down,</p>\n<p>and showed her the way.</p>\n",
        "<p>So she went continually farther and farther, in the wide world, never</p>\n<p>looking about her nor resting, and the seven years were almost past.</p>\n<p>Then she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered, and</p>\n<p>yet they were so far from it!</p>\n<p>Once when they were thus moving onwards, no little feather and no</p>\n<p>drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the Dove had</p>\n<p>disappeared.</p>\n",
        "<p>And as she thought to herself, “In this no man can help</p>\n<p>me,” she climbed up to the Sun, and said to him, “You shine into every</p>\n<p>crevice, and over every peak, have you not seen a white Dove flying?”</p>\n<p>“No,” said the Sun, “I have seen none, but I present you with a casket.</p>\n<p>Open it when you are in sorest need.”</p>\n<p>Then she thanked the Sun, and went on until evening came and the Moon</p>\n<p>appeared.</p>\n",
        "<p>She then asked her, “You shine the whole night through, and</p>\n<p>on every field and forest, have you not seen a white Dove flying?”</p>\n<p>“No,” said the Moon, “I have seen no Dove, but here I give you an egg.</p>\n<p>Break it when you are in great need.”</p>\n<p>She thanked the Moon, and went on until the Night Wind came up and blew</p>\n<p>on her, then she said to it, “You blow over every tree and under every</p>\n<p>leaf, have you not seen a white Dove flying?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“No,” said the Night Wind, “I have seen none, but I will ask the three</p>\n<p>other Winds; perhaps they have seen it.”</p>\n<p>The East Wind and the West Wind came, and had seen nothing, but the</p>\n<p>South Wind said, “I have seen the white Dove, it has flown to the Red</p>\n<p>Sea, there it has become a Lion again, for the seven years are over.</p>\n<p>The Lion is there fighting with a Dragon.</p>\n<p>The Dragon, however, is an</p>\n",
        "<p>enchanted Princess.”</p>\n<p>The Night Wind then said to her, “I will advise you.</p>\n<p>Go to the Red</p>\n<p>Sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds, count them, break off the</p>\n<p>eleventh, and strike the Dragon with it.</p>\n<p>Then the Lion will be able</p>\n<p>to subdue it, and both then will regain their human form.</p>\n",
        "<p>After that,</p>\n<p>look round and you will see the Griffin which is by the Red Sea.</p>\n<p>Swing</p>\n<p>yourself with your beloved, on to his back, and the bird will carry you</p>\n<p>over the sea to your own home.</p>\n<p>“Here is a nut for you, when you are above the centre of the sea, let</p>\n<p>the nut fall.</p>\n",
        "<p>It will immediately shoot up, and a tall nut-tree will</p>\n<p>grow out of the water on which the Griffin may rest; for if he cannot</p>\n<p>rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you across.</p>\n<p>If you forget</p>\n<p>to throw down the nut, he will let you fall into the sea.”</p>\n<p>Then she went thither, and found everything as the Night Wind had said.</p>\n<p>She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh, struck the</p>\n",
        "<p>Dragon with it, whereupon the Lion overcame it.</p>\n<p>Immediately both of</p>\n<p>them regained their human shapes.</p>\n<p>But when the Princess, who had been</p>\n<p>the Dragon, was delivered from enchantment, she took the youth by the</p>\n<p>arm, seated herself on the Griffin, and carried him off with her.</p>\n<p>There stood the poor maiden, who had wandered so far and was again</p>\n",
        "<p>forsaken!</p>\n<p>She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and</p>\n<p>said, “Still I will go as far as the Wind blows and as long as the cock</p>\n<p>crows, until I find him.”</p>\n<p>She went forth by long, long roads, until at last she came to the</p>\n<p>castle, where both of them were living together.</p>\n<p>There she heard that a</p>\n",
        "<p>feast was to be held, in which they would celebrate their wedding, but</p>\n<p>she said, “God still helps me,” and opened the casket that the Sun had</p>\n<p>given her.</p>\n<p>A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself.</p>\n<p>So she took it out and put it on, and went up into the castle, and</p>\n<p>every one, even the Bride, looked at her with astonishment.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n",
        "<p>dress pleased the Bride so well that she thought it might do for her</p>\n<p>wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale?</p>\n<p>“Not for money or land,” answered she, “but for flesh and blood.”</p>\n<p>The Bride asked her what she meant by that, then she said, “Let me</p>\n<p>sleep a night in the chamber where the Bridegroom sleeps.”</p>\n<p>The Bride would not, yet wanted very much to have the dress.</p>\n<p>At last</p>\n",
        "<p>she consented, but the page was to give the Prince a sleeping-draught.</p>\n<p>When it was night, and the youth was already asleep, she was led into</p>\n<p>the chamber.</p>\n<p>She seated herself on the bed and said, “I have followed</p>\n<p>you for seven years.</p>\n<p>I have been to the Sun and the Moon, and the</p>\n<p>Four Winds, and have inquired for you and have helped you against the</p>\n",
        "<p>Dragon.</p>\n<p>Will you, then, forget me?”</p>\n<p>But the Prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the</p>\n<p>wind were whistling outside in the fir-trees.</p>\n<p>When therefore day broke,</p>\n<p>she was led out again, and had to give up the golden dress.</p>\n<p>And as that</p>\n",
        "<p>had been of no avail, she was sad, went out into a meadow, sat down</p>\n<p>there, and wept.</p>\n<p>While she was sitting there, she thought of the egg which the Moon had</p>\n<p>given her.</p>\n<p>She opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve</p>\n<p>chickens all of gold.</p>\n<p>They ran about chirping, and crept again under</p>\n",
        "<p>the old hen’s wings.</p>\n<p>Nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world!</p>\n<p>She arose, and drove them through the meadow.</p>\n<p>The Bride looked out of</p>\n<p>the window, and the little chickens pleased her so that she came down</p>\n<p>and asked if they were for sale.</p>\n<p>“Not for money or land, but for flesh and blood.</p>\n",
        "<p>Let me sleep again in</p>\n<p>the chamber where the Bridegroom sleeps.”</p>\n<p>The Bride said, “Yes,” intending to cheat her as on the former evening.</p>\n<p>But when the Prince went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring</p>\n<p>and rustling in the night had been.</p>\n<p>On this the page told all; that he</p>\n<p>had been forced to give him a sleeping-draught, because a poor girl had</p>\n",
        "<p>slept secretly in the chamber, and that he was to give him another that</p>\n<p>night.</p>\n<p>The Prince said, “Pour out the draught by the bedside.”</p>\n<p>At night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill</p>\n<p>all had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by</p>\n<p>her voice, sprang up and cried, “Now I really am released!</p>\n<p>I have been</p>\n",
        "<p>as it were in a dream, for the strange Princess has bewitched me so</p>\n<p>that I have been compelled to forget you!</p>\n<p>But God has delivered me from</p>\n<p>the spell at the right time.”</p>\n<p>Then they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared</p>\n<p>the father of the Princess, who was a sorcerer.</p>\n<p>They seated themselves</p>\n",
        "<p>on the Griffin which bore them across the Red Sea.</p>\n<p>When they were in</p>\n<p>the midst of it, she let fall the nut.</p>\n<p>Immediately a tall nut-tree grew</p>\n<p>up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried them home, where they</p>\n<p>found their child, who had grown tall and beautiful.</p>\n<p>And they lived thenceforth happily until their death.</p>\n",

        "<p>Witch proposed that he should stay one night more.</p>\n<p>“To-morrow, you</p>\n<p>shall do me a very trifling piece of work.</p>\n<p>Behind my house, there is an</p>\n<p>old, dry well, into which my light has fallen.</p>\n<p>It burns blue, and never</p>\n<p>goes out, and you shall bring it up again for me.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Next day, the Old Woman took him to the well, and let him down in a</p>\n<p>basket.</p>\n<p>He found the Blue Light, and made her a signal to draw him</p>\n<p>up again.</p>\n<p>She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she</p>\n<p>stretched down her hand and wanted to take the Blue Light away from him.</p>\n<p>“No,” said he, perceiving her evil intention, “I will not give you the</p>\n",
        "<p>light, until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.”</p>\n<p>The Witch fell into a passion, let him down again into the well, and</p>\n<p>went away.</p>\n<p>The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the</p>\n<p>Blue Light went on burning.</p>\n<p>But of what use was that to him?</p>\n<p>He</p>\n",
        "<p>saw very well that he could not escape death.</p>\n<p>He sat for a while</p>\n<p>very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his</p>\n<p>pipe, which was still half full of tobacco.</p>\n<p>“This shall be my last</p>\n<p>pleasure,” thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the Blue Light and</p>\n<p>began to smoke.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little Black</p>\n<p>Man stood before him, and said, “Master, what are your commands?”</p>\n<p>“What commands have I to give you?” replied the soldier, quite</p>\n<p>astonished.</p>\n<p>“I must do everything you bid me,” said the Little Man.</p>\n<p>“Good,” said the soldier; “then in the first place help me out of this</p>\n<p>well.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The Little Man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground</p>\n<p>passage, but the soldier did not forget to take the Blue Light with</p>\n<p>him.</p>\n<p>On the way the Little Man showed him treasures hidden there, and</p>\n<p>the soldier took as much gold as he could carry.</p>\n<p>When he was above, he said to the Little Man, “Now go and bind the old</p>\n<p>Witch, and carry her before the judge.”</p>\n",
        "<p>In a short time she, with frightful cries, came riding by, as swift</p>\n<p>as the wind, on a wild tom-cat, nor was it long after that before the</p>\n<p>Little Man reappeared.</p>\n<p>“It is all done,” said he, “and the Witch is</p>\n<p>already hanging on the gallows.</p>\n<p>What further commands has my lord?”</p>\n<p>inquired the Little Man.</p>\n",
        "<p>“At this moment, none,” answered the soldier; “you may return home.</p>\n<p>Only be at hand immediately, if I summon you.”</p>\n<p>“Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the</p>\n<p>Blue Light, and I will appear before you at once.” Thereupon he</p>\n<p>vanished from sight.</p>\n<p>The soldier returned to the town from which he had come.</p>\n<p>He went to the</p>\n",
        "<p>best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord</p>\n<p>furnish him a room as magnificent as possible.</p>\n<p>When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he</p>\n<p>summoned the Little Black Man and said, “I have served the King</p>\n<p>faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I</p>\n<p>want to punish him.”</p>\n<p>“What am I to do?” asked the Little Man.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Late at night, when the King’s Daughter is in bed, bring her here in</p>\n<p>her sleep; she shall do servant’s work for me.”</p>\n<p>The Little Man said, “That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very</p>\n<p>dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.”</p>\n<p>When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the Little</p>\n<p>Man carried in the Princess.</p>\n<p>“Aha!</p>\n",
        "<p>are you there?” cried the soldier, “get to your work at once!</p>\n<p>Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.”</p>\n<p>When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair.</p>\n<p>Then he</p>\n<p>stretched out his feet and said, “Pull off my boots for me,” and made</p>\n<p>her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them.</p>\n<p>She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently</p>\n",
        "<p>and with half-shut eyes.</p>\n<p>When the first cock crowed, the Little Man</p>\n<p>carried her back to the royal Palace, and laid her in her bed.</p>\n<p>Next morning, when the Princess arose, she went to her father, and told</p>\n<p>him that she had had a very strange dream.</p>\n<p>“I was carried through the</p>\n<p>streets with the rapidity of lightning,” said she, “and taken into a</p>\n",
        "<p>soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his</p>\n<p>room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work.</p>\n<p>It was only a</p>\n<p>dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.”</p>\n<p>“The dream may have been true,” said the King.</p>\n<p>“I will give you a piece</p>\n<p>of advice.</p>\n",
        "<p>Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in it,</p>\n<p>and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a</p>\n<p>track in the streets.”</p>\n<p>But unseen by the King, the Little Man was standing beside him when</p>\n<p>he said that, and heard all.</p>\n<p>At night, when the sleeping Princess was</p>\n<p>again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of</p>\n",
        "<p>her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty Little Man had just</p>\n<p>before scattered peas in every other street.</p>\n<p>And again the Princess was</p>\n<p>compelled to do servant’s work until cock-crow.</p>\n<p>Next morning, the King sent his people out to seek the track, but</p>\n<p>it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting,</p>\n<p>picking up peas, and saying, “It must have rained peas, last night.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“We must think of something else,” said the King; “keep your shoes on</p>\n<p>when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you</p>\n<p>are taken, hide one of them there.</p>\n<p>I will soon find it.”</p>\n<p>The Little Black Man heard this plot, and at night when the soldier</p>\n<p>again ordered him to bring the Princess, revealed it to him, and told</p>\n<p>him that he knew of no way to overcome this stratagem, and that if the</p>\n",
        "<p>shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him.</p>\n<p>“Do what I bid you,” replied the soldier.</p>\n<p>And again this third night,</p>\n<p>the Princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went</p>\n<p>away, she hid her shoe under the bed.</p>\n<p>Next morning, the King had the entire town searched for his daughter’s</p>\n<p>shoe.</p>\n",
        "<p>It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at</p>\n<p>the entreaty of the Little Man, had gone outside the city-gate, was</p>\n<p>soon brought back, and thrown into prison.</p>\n<p>In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the</p>\n<p>Blue Light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket.</p>\n<p>And now</p>\n<p>loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when</p>\n",
        "<p>he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by.</p>\n<p>The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up,</p>\n<p>said to him, “Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left</p>\n<p>lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.”</p>\n<p>His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted.</p>\n<p>As soon as the</p>\n<p>soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the Little</p>\n",
        "<p>Black Man.</p>\n<p>“Have no fear,” said the latter to his master.</p>\n<p>“Go wheresoever they</p>\n<p>take you, and let them do what they will, only take the Blue Light with</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked,</p>\n<p>the judge condemned him to death.</p>\n",
        "<p>When he was led forth to die, he</p>\n<p>begged a last favor of the King.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” asked the King.</p>\n<p>“That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.”</p>\n<p>“You may smoke three,” answered the King, “but do not imagine that I</p>\n<p>will spare your life.”</p>\n<p>Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the Blue Light.</p>\n",
        "<p>And as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended the Little Man was</p>\n<p>there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said, “What does my lord</p>\n<p>command?”</p>\n<p>“Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and</p>\n<p>spare not the King who has treated me so ill.”</p>\n<p>Then the Little Man fell on them like lightning, darting this way and</p>\n<p>that, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth,</p>\n",
        "<p>and did not venture to stir again.</p>\n<p>The King was terrified; he threw</p>\n<p>himself on the soldier’s mercy, and begged merely to be allowed to</p>\n<p>live.</p>\n<p>He gave him his kingdom for his own, and the Princess to wife.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE SPINDLE, THE SHUTTLE, AND THE NEEDLE</h3>\n",
        "<p>There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still</p>\n<p>a little child.</p>\n<p>All alone, in a small house at the end of the village,</p>\n<p>dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by spinning, weaving, and</p>\n<p>sewing.</p>\n<p>The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her</p>\n<p>to her work, and educated her in all that is good.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the girl was fifteen, the old woman became ill, called the child</p>\n<p>to her bedside, and said, “Dear Daughter, I feel my end drawing near.</p>\n<p>I leave you the little house, which will protect you from wind and</p>\n<p>weather, and my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which you can earn</p>\n<p>your bread.”</p>\n<p>Then she laid her hands on the girl’s head, blessed her, and said,</p>\n<p>“Only preserve the love of God in your heart, and all will go well with</p>\n",
        "<p>you.”</p>\n<p>Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the</p>\n<p>maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last</p>\n<p>mark of respect.</p>\n<p>And now the maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was</p>\n<p>industrious, and span, wove, and sewed, and the blessing of the good</p>\n<p>old woman was on all that she did.</p>\n",
        "<p>It seemed as if the flax in the room</p>\n<p>increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth</p>\n<p>or carpet, or had made a shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid</p>\n<p>her amply for it.</p>\n<p>So that she was in want of nothing, and even had</p>\n<p>something to share with others.</p>\n<p>About this time, the Son of the King was traveling about the country</p>\n",
        "<p>looking for a Bride.</p>\n<p>He was not to choose a poor one, and did not</p>\n<p>want to have a rich one.</p>\n<p>So he said, “She shall be my wife who is the</p>\n<p>poorest, and at the same time the richest.”</p>\n<p>When he came to the village where the maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he</p>\n<p>did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest girl in</p>\n",
        "<p>the place?</p>\n<p>They first named the richest; the poorest, they said, was</p>\n<p>the girl who lived in the small house quite at the end of the village.</p>\n<p>The rich girl was sitting in all her splendor before the door of her</p>\n<p>house, and when the Prince approached her, she got up, went to meet</p>\n<p>him, and made him a low curtsey.</p>\n<p>He looked at her, said nothing, and</p>\n",
        "<p>rode on.</p>\n<p>When he came to the house of the poor girl, she was not standing at</p>\n<p>the door, but sitting in her little room.</p>\n<p>He stopped his horse, and</p>\n<p>saw, through the window on which the bright sun was shining, the girl</p>\n<p>sitting at her spinning-wheel, busily spinning.</p>\n<p>She looked up, and when</p>\n",
        "<p>she saw that the Prince was gazing in, blushed all over her face, let</p>\n<p>her eyes fall, and went on spinning.</p>\n<p>I do not know whether, just at</p>\n<p>that moment, the thread was quite even; but she went on spinning until</p>\n<p>the King’s Son had ridden away again.</p>\n<p>Then she stepped to the window, opened it, and said, “It is so warm in</p>\n<p>this room!” but she still looked after him as long as she could see the</p>\n",
        "<p>white feathers in his hat.</p>\n<p>Then she sat down to work again in her own</p>\n<p>room and went on with her spinning.</p>\n<p>And a saying which the old woman</p>\n<p>had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her</p>\n<p>mind, and she sang these words to herself:</p>\n<p>“_Spindle, my Spindle, haste, haste thee away,</p>\n",
        "<p>Here to my house bring the wooer, I pray._”</p>\n<p>And what do you think happened?</p>\n<p>The spindle sprang out of her hand in</p>\n<p>an instant, and out of the door.</p>\n<p>And when, in her astonishment, she got</p>\n<p>up and looked after it, she saw that it was dancing out merrily into</p>\n<p>the open country, and drawing a shining golden thread after it.</p>\n",
        "<p>Before</p>\n<p>long, it had entirely vanished from her sight.</p>\n<p>As she had now no spindle, the girl took the weaver’s shuttle in her</p>\n<p>hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave.</p>\n<p>The spindle, however, danced continually onward, and just as the thread</p>\n<p>came to an end, reached the Prince.</p>\n<p>“What do I see?” he cried; “the spindle certainly wants to show me the</p>\n",
        "<p>way!” He turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread.</p>\n<p>The girl was, however, sitting at her work singing:</p>\n<p>“_Shuttle, my Shuttle, weave well this day,</p>\n<p>And guide the wooer to me, I pray._”</p>\n<p>Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.</p>\n<p>Before the threshold, however, it began to weave a carpet which was</p>\n<p>more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld.</p>\n",
        "<p>Lilies and</p>\n<p>roses blossomed on both sides of it.</p>\n<p>And on a golden ground in the</p>\n<p>centre green branches ascended, under which bounded hares and rabbits.</p>\n<p>Stags and deer stretched their heads in between them.</p>\n<p>Brightly-colored</p>\n<p>birds were sitting in the branches above.</p>\n",
        "<p>They lacked nothing but the</p>\n<p>gift of song.</p>\n<p>The shuttle leapt hither and thither, and everything</p>\n<p>seemed to grow of its own accord.</p>\n<p>As the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew.</p>\n<p>She held the</p>\n<p>needle in her hand and sang:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Needle, my Needle, sharp-pointed and fine,</p>\n<p>Prepare for a wooer this house of mine._”</p>\n<p>Then the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere about</p>\n<p>the room as quick as lightning.</p>\n<p>It was just as if invisible spirits</p>\n<p>were working.</p>\n<p>They covered tables and benches with green cloth in an</p>\n",
        "<p>instant, and the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken</p>\n<p>curtains.</p>\n<p>Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch, than the maiden saw</p>\n<p>through the window the white feathers of the Prince, whom the spindle</p>\n<p>had brought thither by the golden thread.</p>\n<p>He alighted, stepped over the</p>\n<p>carpet into the house, and when he entered the room, there stood the</p>\n",
        "<p>maiden in her poor garments, but she shone out from them like a rose</p>\n<p>surrounded by leaves.</p>\n<p>“You are the poorest and also the richest,” said he to her.</p>\n<p>“Come with</p>\n<p>me, you shall be my Bride.”</p>\n<p>She did not speak, but she gave him her hand.</p>\n<p>Then he kissed her, and</p>\n",
        "<p>led her forth, lifted her on to his horse, and took her to the royal</p>\n<p>castle, where the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings.</p>\n<p>The spindle, shuttle, and needle were preserved in the</p>\n<p>treasure-chamber, and held in great honor.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE THREE LUCK-CHILDREN</h3>\n<p>A father once called his three sons before him.</p>\n",

        "<p>from a long distance, sitting upon the steeples and turning round with</p>\n<p>the wind; and in the villages he heard more than one crowing.</p>\n<p>No one</p>\n<p>would show any wonder at the creature, so that it did not look as if he</p>\n<p>would make his fortune by it.</p>\n<p>[Illustration: WHEN THE CORN WAS RIPE, THEY SHOT IT DOWN]</p>\n<p>At last, however, it happened that he came to an island where the</p>\n",

        "<p>It has a ruby-red crown upon</p>\n<p>its head, and wears spurs like a knight.</p>\n<p>It calls you three times</p>\n<p>during the night, at fixed hours; and when it calls for the last time,</p>\n<p>the sun soon after rises.</p>\n<p>But if it crows by broad daylight, then take</p>\n<p>notice, for there will certainly be a change of weather.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The people were well pleased.</p>\n<p>For a whole night they did not sleep, and</p>\n<p>listened with great delight as the cock at two, four, and six o’clock,</p>\n<p>loudly and clearly proclaimed the time.</p>\n<p>They asked if the creature were</p>\n<p>for sale, and how much he wanted for it.</p>\n<p>“About as much gold as an ass can carry,” answered he.</p>\n",
        "<p>“A ridiculously small price for such a precious creature!” they cried</p>\n<p>all together, and willingly gave him what he had asked.</p>\n<p>When he came home with his wealth, his brothers were astonished, and</p>\n<p>the second said, “Well, I will go forth and see whether I cannot get</p>\n<p>rid of my scythe as profitably.” But it did not look as if he would,</p>\n<p>for laborers met him everywhere, and they had scythes upon their</p>\n<p>shoulders as well as he.</p>\n",
        "<p>At last, however, he chanced upon an island where the people knew</p>\n<p>nothing of scythes.</p>\n<p>When the corn was ripe, they took cannon out to</p>\n<p>the fields and shot it down.</p>\n<p>Now this was rather an uncertain affair.</p>\n<p>Many shot right over it, others hit the ears instead of the stems and</p>\n<p>shot them away, whereby much was lost; and besides all this it made a</p>\n",

        "<p>He</p>\n<p>fared just like the others.</p>\n<p>So long as he stayed on the mainland, there</p>\n<p>was nothing to be done.</p>\n<p>Every place had cats, and there were so many of</p>\n<p>them that most new-born kittens were drowned in the ponds.</p>\n<p>At last, he sailed to an island, and it luckily happened that no cats</p>\n",

        "<p>When they heard this strange cry, the King and all his people were</p>\n<p>frightened, and in their terror ran out of the palace.</p>\n<p>Then the King took counsel what was best to be done.</p>\n<p>At last, it was</p>\n<p>decided to send a herald to the cat, and command her to leave the</p>\n<p>palace; if not, she was to expect that force would be used against her.</p>\n<p>The councilors said, “We would rather be plagued with mice to which</p>\n",

        "<p>Most certainly</p>\n<p>not!” and took this answer to the King.</p>\n<p>“Then,” said the councilors, “she must yield to force.”</p>\n<p>Cannon were brought out, and the palace was soon in flames.</p>\n<p>When the</p>\n<p>fire reached the room where the cat was sitting, she sprang safely out</p>\n<p>of the window.</p>\n",

        "<p>They will let the cloak fall down</p>\n<p>to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop dead.</p>\n<p>“Carry away the cloak, it is a Wishing-Cloak.</p>\n<p>When you throw it over</p>\n<p>your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain place, and you</p>\n<p>will be there in the twinkling of an eye.</p>\n<p>Take out the heart of the</p>\n",
        "<p>dead bird, swallow it whole, and every morning early, when you get up,</p>\n<p>you will find a gold piece under your pillow.”</p>\n<p>The huntsman thanked the Wise Woman, and thought to himself, “Those are</p>\n<p>fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come true!”</p>\n<p>And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard in the</p>\n<p>branches above him a screaming and twittering.</p>\n<p>He looked up and saw a</p>\n",
        "<p>crowd of birds, who were tearing a piece of cloth with their beaks and</p>\n<p>claws, and tugging and fighting as if each wanted to have it all to</p>\n<p>himself.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the huntsman, “this is wonderful.</p>\n<p>It has come to pass just</p>\n<p>as the old wife foretold!” and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed</p>\n<p>and fired right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about.</p>\n",
        "<p>The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped</p>\n<p>down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time.</p>\n<p>Then the huntsman did</p>\n<p>as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the heart,</p>\n<p>swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him.</p>\n<p>Next morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him.</p>\n<p>He wished to</p>\n",
        "<p>see if it also had been fulfilled.</p>\n<p>When he lifted up the pillow, the</p>\n<p>gold piece shone in his eyes.</p>\n<p>The next day, he found another, and so</p>\n<p>it went on, every time he got up.</p>\n<p>He gathered together a heap of gold,</p>\n<p>but at last he thought, “Of what use is all my gold to me if I stay at</p>\n",
        "<p>home?</p>\n<p>I will go forth and see the world.”</p>\n<p>He then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman’s pouch and</p>\n<p>gun, and went out into the world.</p>\n<p>It came to pass, that one day he traveled through a dense forest, and</p>\n<p>when he came to the end of it, in the plain before him was a fine</p>\n<p>castle.</p>\n",
        "<p>An Old Woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden,</p>\n<p>looking out of one of the windows.</p>\n<p>The Old Woman, however, was a Witch and said to the maiden, “There</p>\n<p>comes a man out of the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in his</p>\n<p>body.</p>\n<p>We must filch it from him, my dear Daughter.</p>\n<p>It is more suitable</p>\n",
        "<p>for us than for him.</p>\n<p>He has a bird’s heart about him, by means of which</p>\n<p>every morning, a gold piece lies under his pillow.” She told her what</p>\n<p>she was to do to get it, and what part she had to play, and finally</p>\n<p>threatened her, and said with angry eyes, “And if you do not attend to</p>\n<p>what I say, it will be the worse for you.”</p>\n<p>Now when the huntsman came nearer he descried the maiden, and said to</p>\n",
        "<p>himself, “I have traveled about for such a long time, I will take a</p>\n<p>rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle.</p>\n<p>I have certainly money</p>\n<p>enough.” Nevertheless, the real reason was that he had caught sight of</p>\n<p>the pretty maiden.</p>\n<p>He entered the house, and was well received and courteously</p>\n<p>entertained.</p>\n",
        "<p>Before long, he was so much in love with the young Witch</p>\n<p>that he no longer thought of anything else, and saw things as she saw</p>\n<p>them, and did what she desired.</p>\n<p>The Old Woman then said, “Now we must have the bird’s heart, he will</p>\n<p>never miss it.” She prepared a drink, and when it was ready, poured</p>\n<p>it into a cup and gave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the</p>\n<p>huntsman.</p>\n",
        "<p>She did so, saying, “Now, my Dearest, drink to me.”</p>\n<p>So he took the cup, and when he had swallowed the draught, he brought</p>\n<p>up the heart of the bird.</p>\n<p>The girl had to take it away secretly and</p>\n<p>swallow it herself, for the Old Woman would have it so.</p>\n<p>Thenceforward</p>\n<p>he found no more gold under his pillow.</p>\n",
        "<p>But it lay instead under that</p>\n<p>of the maiden, from whence the Old Woman fetched it away every morning.</p>\n<p>But he was so much in love and so befooled, that he thought of nothing</p>\n<p>else but of passing his time with the maiden.</p>\n<p>Then the old Witch said, “We have the bird’s heart, but we must also</p>\n<p>take the Wishing-Cloak away from him.”</p>\n<p>The maiden answered, “We will leave him that; he has lost his wealth.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The Old Woman was angry and said, “Such a mantle is a wonderful thing,</p>\n<p>and is seldom to be found in this world.</p>\n<p>I must and will have it!” She</p>\n<p>gave the maiden several blows, and said that if she did not obey, it</p>\n<p>should fare ill with her.</p>\n<p>So she did the Old Woman’s bidding, placed herself at the window and</p>\n<p>looked on the distant country, as if she were very sorrowful.</p>\n",
        "<p>The huntsman asked, “Why do you stand there so sorrowfully?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, my Beloved,” was her answer, “over yonder lies the Garnet</p>\n<p>Mountain, where the precious stones grow.</p>\n<p>I long for them so much that</p>\n<p>when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get them?</p>\n<p>Only the</p>\n<p>birds; they fly and can reach them, but a man never.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Have you nothing else to complain of?” said the huntsman.</p>\n<p>“I will soon</p>\n<p>remove that burden from your heart.”</p>\n<p>With that he drew her under his mantle, wished himself on the Garnet</p>\n<p>Mountain.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together.</p>\n<p>Precious stones were glistening on every side, so that it was a joy to</p>\n",
        "<p>see them.</p>\n<p>Together they gathered the finest and costliest of them.</p>\n<p>Now, the Old Woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the eyes</p>\n<p>of the huntsman should become heavy.</p>\n<p>He said to the maiden, “We will</p>\n<p>sit down and rest a while.</p>\n<p>I am so tired, that I can no longer stand on</p>\n",
        "<p>my feet.”</p>\n<p>Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap, and fell asleep.</p>\n<p>When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle from his shoulders, and</p>\n<p>wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets and stones, and wished</p>\n<p>herself back at home with them.</p>\n<p>But when the huntsman had had his sleep out, he awoke, and perceived</p>\n<p>that his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild</p>\n",
        "<p>mountain.</p>\n<p>Then he said, “Oh, what treachery there is in the world!” and</p>\n<p>sat there in care and sorrow, not knowing what to do.</p>\n<p>But the mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous Giants, who dwelt</p>\n<p>thereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long, before he</p>\n<p>saw three of them coming toward him.</p>\n<p>The Giants came up, and the first</p>\n",
        "<p>kicked him with his foot and said, “What sort of an earthworm is lying</p>\n<p>curled up here?”</p>\n<p>The second said, “Step upon him and kill him.”</p>\n<p>But the third said, “Would that be worth your while?</p>\n<p>Let him live, he</p>\n<p>cannot remain here.</p>\n<p>When he climbs higher, toward the summit of the</p>\n",
        "<p>mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him and bear him away.” So saying</p>\n<p>they passed by.</p>\n<p>But the Huntsman had paid heed to their words, and as soon as they</p>\n<p>were gone, he rose and climbed up to the summit of the mountain.</p>\n<p>And when he had sat there a while, a cloud floated toward him,</p>\n<p>caught him up, carried him away, and traveled about for a long time</p>\n<p>in the heavens.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then it sank lower, and let itself down on a great</p>\n<p>cabbage-garden, girt round by walls, so that he came softly to the</p>\n<p>ground on cabbages and vegetables.</p>\n<p>Then the huntsman looked about him, and said, “If I only had something</p>\n<p>to eat!</p>\n<p>I am so hungry, and my hunger will grow greater.</p>\n<p>But I see here</p>\n",
        "<p>neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort of fruit, everywhere there</p>\n<p>is nothing but cabbages.” At length he thought, “At a pinch I can eat</p>\n<p>some of the leaves.</p>\n<p>They do not taste particularly good, but they will</p>\n<p>refresh me.”</p>\n<p>With that he picked himself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n",
        "<p>scarcely had he swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, when wonderful!</p>\n<p>he</p>\n<p>felt quite changed.</p>\n<p>Four legs grew on him, a large head and two thick ears; and he saw with</p>\n<p>horror that he was changed into a Donkey.</p>\n<p>Still as his hunger became</p>\n<p>greater every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his</p>\n",
        "<p>present nature, he went on eating with great zest.</p>\n<p>At last he arrived</p>\n<p>at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had swallowed it, he</p>\n<p>again felt a change, and resumed his human shape.</p>\n<p>Then the huntsman lay down, and slept off his fatigue.</p>\n<p>When he awoke</p>\n<p>next morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another of</p>\n",
        "<p>the good ones, and thought to himself, “This shall help me to get my</p>\n<p>own again and punish treachery.”</p>\n<p>Then he took the cabbages with him, climbed over the wall, and went</p>\n<p>forth to seek for the castle of his sweetheart.</p>\n<p>After wandering about for a couple of days, he was lucky enough to find</p>\n<p>it again.</p>\n<p>He dyed his face brown, so that his own mother would not have</p>\n",
        "<p>known him; and begged for shelter.</p>\n<p>“I am so tired,” said he, “that I</p>\n<p>can go no further.”</p>\n<p>The Witch asked, “Who are you, Countryman, and what is your business?”</p>\n<p>Said he, “I have been so fortunate as to find the most wonderful salad</p>\n<p>which grows under the sun, and am carrying it about with me.”</p>\n<p>When the Old Woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and</p>\n",
        "<p>said, “Dear Countryman, let me just taste this wonderful salad.”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” answered he, “I have brought two heads with me, and will</p>\n<p>give you one of them,” and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad</p>\n<p>cabbage.</p>\n<p>The Witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so for this</p>\n<p>new dish, that she herself went into the kitchen and prepared it.</p>\n<p>When</p>\n",
        "<p>it was ready she could not wait until it was set on the table, but took</p>\n<p>a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her mouth.</p>\n<p>Hardly had she</p>\n<p>swallowed them, than she was deprived of her human shape, and she ran</p>\n<p>out into the courtyard in the form of a Donkey.</p>\n<p>Presently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad standing</p>\n<p>there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up.</p>\n",
        "<p>But on the way,</p>\n<p>according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste, and she ate</p>\n<p>a couple of leaves.</p>\n<p>Instantly the magic power showed itself, and she</p>\n<p>likewise became a Donkey, and ran out to the Old Woman.</p>\n<p>And the dish</p>\n<p>of salad fell to the ground.</p>\n",
        "<p>Meantime the huntsman sat beside the beautiful maiden, and as no one</p>\n<p>came with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, “I don’t</p>\n<p>know what has become of the salad.”</p>\n<p>The huntsman thought, “The salad must have already taken effect,” and</p>\n<p>said, “I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it.”</p>\n<p>As he went down he saw the two Donkeys running about in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>The salad, however, was lying on the ground.</p>\n",
        "<p>“All right,” said he, “the</p>\n<p>two have taken their portion,” and he picked up the other leaves, laid</p>\n<p>them on the dish, and carried them to the maiden.</p>\n<p>“I bring you the</p>\n<p>delicate food myself,” said he, “in order that you may not have to wait</p>\n<p>longer.”</p>\n<p>Then she ate of it, and was, like the others, immediately deprived of</p>\n",
        "<p>her human form, and ran out into the courtyard in the shape of a Donkey.</p>\n<p>After the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones</p>\n<p>could recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said,</p>\n<p>“Now you shall receive the wages of your treachery,” and bound them</p>\n<p>together, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came</p>\n<p>to a mill.</p>\n<p>He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head, and asked what</p>\n",
        "<p>he wanted.</p>\n<p>“I have three unmanageable beasts,” answered he, “which I</p>\n<p>don’t want to keep any longer.</p>\n<p>Will you take them in, and give them</p>\n<p>food and stable room, and manage them as I tell you?</p>\n<p>Then I will pay</p>\n<p>you what you ask.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The miller said, “Why not?</p>\n<p>But how am I to manage them?”</p>\n<p>The huntsman then said that he was to give three beatings and one</p>\n<p>meal daily to the old Donkey, and that was the Witch; one beating and</p>\n<p>three meals to the younger one, which was the servant-girl; and to the</p>\n<p>youngest, which was the maiden, no beatings and three meals, for he</p>\n<p>could not bring himself to have the maiden beaten.</p>\n",
        "<p>After that he went</p>\n<p>back into the castle, and found therein everything he needed.</p>\n<p>After a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him</p>\n<p>that the old Donkey which had received three beatings and only one</p>\n<p>meal daily, was dead; “the two others,” he continued, “are certainly</p>\n<p>not dead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they</p>\n<p>cannot last much longer.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The huntsman was moved to pity, put away his anger, and told the miller</p>\n<p>to drive them back again to him.</p>\n<p>And when they came, he gave them some</p>\n<p>of the good salad, so that they became human again.</p>\n<p>The beautiful maiden fell on her knees before him, and said, “Ah, my</p>\n<p>Beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you.</p>\n<p>My mother drove</p>\n",
        "<p>me to it.</p>\n<p>It was done against my will, for I love you dearly.</p>\n<p>Your</p>\n<p>Wishing-Cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the Bird’s-Heart I will</p>\n<p>take a potion and bring it up again.”</p>\n<p>But he thought otherwise, and said, “Keep it.</p>\n<p>It is all the same, for I</p>\n",
        "<p>will take you for my true wife.”</p>\n<p>So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily together until</p>\n<p>their death.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>CLEVER HANS</h3>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>The mother of Hans said, “Whither away, Hans?”</p>\n",

        "<p>Then a King’s Daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself and</p>\n<p>could not find her father’s kingdom again.</p>\n<p>After she had wandered about</p>\n<p>for nine days, she at length came to the Iron Stove.</p>\n<p>Then a voice</p>\n<p>issued from it, and asked her, “Whence come you, and whither go you?”</p>\n<p>She answered, “I have lost my father’s kingdom, and cannot get home</p>\n",
        "<p>again.”</p>\n<p>Then a voice inside the Iron Stove said, “I will help you to get home,</p>\n<p>and that indeed most swiftly, if you will promise to do what I desire</p>\n<p>of you.</p>\n<p>I am the son of a far greater King than your father, and I will</p>\n<p>marry you.”</p>\n<p>Then was she afraid, and thought, “Alas!</p>\n",
        "<p>What use could I have with</p>\n<p>an Iron Stove?” But as she much wished to get home to her father, she</p>\n<p>promised to do as he desired.</p>\n<p>He said, “You shall return here, and bring a knife with you, and scrape</p>\n<p>a hole in the iron.”</p>\n<p>Then he gave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak.</p>\n<p>In two hours he took her home.</p>\n",
        "<p>There was great joy in the castle when</p>\n<p>the King’s Daughter came back, and the old King fell on her neck, and</p>\n<p>kissed her.</p>\n<p>She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, “Dear Father, what I</p>\n<p>have suffered!</p>\n<p>I should never have got home again from the great wild</p>\n<p>forest, if I had not come to an Iron Stove.</p>\n",
        "<p>But I have been forced to</p>\n<p>give my word that I will go back to it, set it free, and marry it.”</p>\n<p>Then the old King was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he had</p>\n<p>only this one daughter.</p>\n<p>They, therefore, resolved they would send, in</p>\n<p>her place, the miller’s daughter, who was very beautiful.</p>\n<p>They took her</p>\n",
        "<p>there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the Iron Stove.</p>\n<p>So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but could not bring off</p>\n<p>the least morsel of it.</p>\n<p>When day dawned, a voice in the stove said, “It seems to me it is day</p>\n<p>outside.”</p>\n<p>Then she answered, “It seems so to me too.</p>\n<p>I fancy I hear the noise of</p>\n",

        "<p>With these she traveled onwards, and when she came to the Glass</p>\n<p>Mountain, which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first</p>\n<p>behind her feet and then before them, and so got over it.</p>\n<p>And when</p>\n<p>she was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully.</p>\n<p>After this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated</p>\n<p>herself on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them.</p>\n",
        "<p>At last she arrived</p>\n<p>in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she came to a</p>\n<p>large and beautiful castle.</p>\n<p>She went in and asked for a place.</p>\n<p>She knew, however, that the King’s</p>\n<p>Son whom she had released from the Iron Stove in the great forest, was</p>\n<p>in the castle.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages.</p>\n<p>But,</p>\n<p>already the King’s Son had another maiden by his side, whom he wanted</p>\n<p>to marry, for he thought that she had long been dead.</p>\n<p>In the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her</p>\n<p>pocket and found the three nuts which the old Toad had given her.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n",

        "<p>But the girl would not take</p>\n<p>money, and begged that she might once again sleep in the Bridegroom’s</p>\n<p>chamber.</p>\n<p>The Bride, however, gave him a sleeping-drink, and he slept so</p>\n<p>soundly that he could hear nothing.</p>\n<p>But the scullery-maid wept the whole night long, and cried, “I set you</p>\n<p>free when you were in an Iron Stove in the wild forest.</p>\n",

        "<p>you free when you were in the Iron Stove in the terrible wild forest,”</p>\n<p>the King’s Son leapt up and said, “You are the true one, you are mine,</p>\n<p>and I am yours.”</p>\n<p>Thereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her,</p>\n<p>and they took away the false Bride’s clothes so that she could not get</p>\n<p>up.</p>\n<p>When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and when</p>\n",

        "<p>But Snow-White sat at home</p>\n<p>with her mother, and helped her with the housework, or read to her when</p>\n<p>there was nothing to do.</p>\n<p>The two children were so fond of each other, that they always held each</p>\n<p>other by the hand when they went out together.</p>\n<p>When Snow-White said,</p>\n<p>“We will not leave each other,” Rose-Red answered, “Never so long as we</p>\n",

        "<p>on their account.</p>\n<p>One day, when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had</p>\n<p>roused them, they saw a beautiful Child in a shining white dress</p>\n<p>sitting near their bed.</p>\n<p>He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but</p>\n<p>said nothing and went away into the forest.</p>\n<p>And when they looked round,</p>\n",
        "<p>they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and</p>\n<p>would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness, if they had gone</p>\n<p>only a few paces farther.</p>\n<p>And their mother told them that it must have</p>\n<p>been the Angel who watches over good children.</p>\n<p>Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat,</p>\n<p>that it was a pleasure to look inside it.</p>\n",
        "<p>In the summer, Rose-Red took</p>\n<p>care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her</p>\n<p>mother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree.</p>\n<p>In</p>\n<p>the winter, Snow-White lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hook.</p>\n<p>The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it</p>\n<p>polished.</p>\n",
        "<p>In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, “Go,</p>\n<p>Snow-White, and bolt the door,” and then they sat round the hearth, and</p>\n<p>the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>two girls listened as they sat and span.</p>\n<p>And close by them lay a lamb</p>\n<p>upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its</p>\n",
        "<p>head hidden beneath its wings.</p>\n<p>One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one</p>\n<p>knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in.</p>\n<p>The mother said,</p>\n<p>“Quick, Rose-Red, open the door, it must be a traveler who is seeking</p>\n<p>shelter.”</p>\n<p>Rose-Red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor</p>\n",
        "<p>man, but it was not.</p>\n<p>It was a Bear that stretched his broad, black head</p>\n<p>within the door.</p>\n<p>Rose-Red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove</p>\n<p>fluttered, and Snow-White hid herself behind her mother’s bed.</p>\n<p>But the Bear began to speak and said, “Do not be afraid.</p>\n<p>I will do you</p>\n",
        "<p>no harm!</p>\n<p>I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside</p>\n<p>you.”</p>\n<p>“Poor Bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire.</p>\n<p>Only take care</p>\n<p>that you do not burn your coat.” Then she cried, “Snow-White, Rose-Red,</p>\n<p>come out, the Bear will do you no harm, he means well.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and</p>\n<p>were not afraid of him.</p>\n<p>The Bear said, “Here, Children, knock the snow out of my coat a</p>\n<p>little;” so they brought the broom and swept the Bear’s hide clean.</p>\n<p>And he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and</p>\n<p>comfortably.</p>\n<p>It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with</p>\n",
        "<p>their clumsy guest.</p>\n<p>They tugged at his hair with their hands, put their</p>\n<p>feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch</p>\n<p>and beat him, and, when he growled, they laughed.</p>\n<p>But the Bear took it</p>\n<p>all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out, “Leave</p>\n<p>me alive, Children:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Snowy-white, Rosy-red,_</p>\n<p>_Will you beat your lover dead?_”</p>\n<p>When it was bedtime, and the others went to sleep, the mother said to</p>\n<p>the Bear, “You may lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe</p>\n<p>from the cold and the bad weather.”</p>\n<p>As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted</p>\n<p>across the snow into the forest.</p>\n",
        "<p>Henceforth the Bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself</p>\n<p>down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as</p>\n<p>much as they liked.</p>\n<p>They got so used to him, that the doors were never</p>\n<p>fastened until their black friend had arrived.</p>\n<p>When spring was come and all outside was green, the Bear said one</p>\n<p>morning to Snow-White, “Now I must go away, and cannot come back for</p>\n",
        "<p>the whole summer.”</p>\n<p>“Where are you going, then, dear Bear?” asked Snow-White.</p>\n<p>“I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked</p>\n<p>Dwarfs.</p>\n<p>In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged</p>\n<p>to stay below and cannot work their way through.</p>\n<p>But now, when the sun</p>\n",

        "<p>and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off.</p>\n<p>It seemed to Snow-White as</p>\n<p>if she saw gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>Bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.</p>\n<p>A short time afterward, the mother sent her children into the forest</p>\n<p>to get fire-wood.</p>\n",
        "<p>There they found a big tree which lay felled on the</p>\n<p>ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backward and</p>\n<p>forward in the grass.</p>\n<p>But they could not make out what it was.</p>\n<p>When they came nearer they saw a Dwarf with an old withered face and</p>\n<p>a snow-white beard a yard long.</p>\n<p>The end of the beard was caught in a</p>\n",
        "<p>crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping backward and</p>\n<p>forward like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.</p>\n<p>He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried, “Why do you</p>\n<p>stand there?</p>\n<p>Can you not come here and help me?”</p>\n<p>“What are you about there, Little Man?” asked Rose-Red.</p>\n<p>“You stupid, prying goose!” answered the Dwarf; “I was going to split</p>\n",
        "<p>the tree to get a little wood for cooking.</p>\n<p>The little bit of food that</p>\n<p>one of us wants gets burnt up directly with thick logs.</p>\n<p>We do not</p>\n<p>swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk.</p>\n<p>I had just driven the wedge</p>\n<p>safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the wretched wood</p>\n",
        "<p>was too smooth and suddenly sprang asunder, and the tree closed so</p>\n<p>quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard.</p>\n<p>So now it</p>\n<p>is tight in, and I cannot get away.</p>\n<p>And you silly, sleek, milk-faced</p>\n<p>things laugh!</p>\n<p>Ugh!</p>\n",
        "<p>how odious you are!”</p>\n<p>The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it</p>\n<p>was caught too fast.</p>\n<p>“I will run and fetch some one,” said Rose-Red.</p>\n<p>“You senseless goose!” snarled the Dwarf.</p>\n<p>“Why should you fetch</p>\n<p>some one?</p>\n",
        "<p>You are already two too many for me.</p>\n<p>Can you not think of</p>\n<p>something better?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be impatient,” said Snow-White, “I will help you,” and she</p>\n<p>pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.</p>\n<p>As soon as the Dwarf felt himself free, he grabbed a bag which lay</p>\n<p>amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted</p>\n",
        "<p>it up, grumbling to himself, “Rude people, to cut off a piece of my</p>\n<p>fine beard!</p>\n<p>Bad luck to you!” and then he swung the bag upon his back,</p>\n<p>and went off without even once looking at the children.</p>\n<p>Some time after that Snow-White and Rose-Red went to catch a dish of</p>\n<p>fish.</p>\n<p>As they came near the brook, they saw something like a large</p>\n",
        "<p>grasshopper jumping toward the water, as if it were going to leap in.</p>\n<p>They ran to it and found it was the Dwarf.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going?” said Rose-Red; “you surely don’t want to go into</p>\n<p>the water?”</p>\n<p>[Illustration: “DON’T BE IMPATIENT,” SAID SNOW-WHITE, “I WILL HELP YOU”]</p>\n<p>“I am not such a fool!” cried the Dwarf; “don’t you see that the</p>\n<p>accursed fish wants to pull me in?” The Little Man had been sitting</p>\n",
        "<p>there fishing, and unluckily the wind had twisted his beard with the</p>\n<p>fishing-line.</p>\n<p>Just then a big fish bit, and the feeble creature had not</p>\n<p>strength to pull it out.</p>\n<p>The fish kept the upper hand and was pulling</p>\n<p>the Dwarf toward him.</p>\n<p>He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it</p>\n",
        "<p>was of little good, he was forced to follow the fish, and was in</p>\n<p>great danger of being dragged into the water.</p>\n<p>The girls came just in time.</p>\n<p>They held him fast and tried to free his</p>\n<p>beard from the line.</p>\n<p>But all in vain, beard and line were entangled</p>\n<p>fast together.</p>\n",
        "<p>Nothing was left but to bring out the scissors and cut</p>\n<p>the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost.</p>\n<p>When the Dwarf saw that, he screamed out, “Is that civil, you</p>\n<p>toadstool, to disfigure one’s face?</p>\n<p>Was it not enough to clip off the</p>\n<p>end of my beard?</p>\n<p>Now you have cut off the best part of it.</p>\n",
        "<p>I cannot</p>\n<p>let myself be seen by my people.</p>\n<p>I wish you had been made to run the</p>\n<p>soles off your shoes!” Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in</p>\n<p>the rushes, and, without saying a word more, he dragged it away and</p>\n<p>disappeared behind a stone.</p>\n<p>It happened that soon afterward the mother sent the two children to the</p>\n",
        "<p>town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons.</p>\n<p>The road led</p>\n<p>them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about.</p>\n<p>They now noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round</p>\n<p>and round above them.</p>\n<p>It sank lower and lower, and at last settled near</p>\n<p>a rock not far off.</p>\n",
        "<p>Directly afterward they heard a loud, piteous cry.</p>\n<p>They ran up and saw, with horror, that the eagle had seized their old</p>\n<p>acquaintance the Dwarf, and was going to carry him off.</p>\n<p>The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the Little Man,</p>\n<p>and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.</p>\n<p>As soon as the Dwarf had recovered from his first fright, he cried</p>\n<p>with his shrill voice, “Could you not have done it more carefully!</p>\n",
        "<p>You</p>\n<p>dragged at my brown coat, so that it is all torn and full of holes.</p>\n<p>You</p>\n<p>helpless, clumsy creatures!” Then he took up a sack full of precious</p>\n<p>stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole.</p>\n<p>The girls, who by this time were used to his thanklessness, went on</p>\n<p>their way and did their business in the town.</p>\n",
        "<p>As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the</p>\n<p>Dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,</p>\n<p>and had not thought that any one would come there at such a late hour.</p>\n<p>The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones.</p>\n<p>They glittered and</p>\n<p>sparkled with all colors so beautifully, that the children stood still</p>\n<p>and looked at them.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Why do you stand gaping there?” cried the Dwarf, and his ashen-gray</p>\n<p>face became copper-red with rage.</p>\n<p>He was going on with his bad words,</p>\n<p>when a loud growling was heard, and a black Bear came trotting toward</p>\n<p>them out of the forest.</p>\n<p>The Dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could</p>\n<p>not get to his cave, for the Bear was already close.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then in the fear of his heart he cried, “Dear Mr.</p>\n<p>Bear, spare me!</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>will give you all my treasures!</p>\n<p>Look, the beautiful jewels lying there!</p>\n<p>Grant me my life.</p>\n<p>What do you want with such a slender little fellow</p>\n",
        "<p>as I?</p>\n<p>You would not feel me between your teeth.</p>\n<p>Come, take these two</p>\n<p>wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails.</p>\n<p>For</p>\n<p>mercy’s sake eat them!”</p>\n<p>The Bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a</p>\n",
        "<p>single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.</p>\n<p>The girls had run away, but the Bear called to them, “Snow-White and</p>\n<p>Rose-Red, do not be afraid.</p>\n<p>Wait, I will come with you.”</p>\n<p>Then they knew his voice and waited.</p>\n<p>And when he came up to them,</p>\n<p>suddenly his bear-skin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man,</p>\n",
        "<p>clothed all in gold.</p>\n<p>“I am a King’s Son,” he said, “and I was bewitched by that wicked</p>\n<p>Dwarf, who had stolen my treasures.</p>\n<p>I have had to run about the forest</p>\n<p>as a savage bear until I was freed by his death.</p>\n<p>Now he has got his</p>\n<p>well-deserved punishment.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Snow-White was married to him, and Rose-Red to his brother.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>divided between them the great treasure which the Dwarf had gathered</p>\n<p>together in his cave.</p>\n<p>The old mother lived peacefully and happily with</p>\n<p>her children for many years.</p>\n<p>She took the two rose-trees with her, and</p>\n",
        "<p>they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful</p>\n<p>roses, white and red.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE HEDGE-KING</h3>\n<p>In former days, every sound had its meaning, the birds also had their</p>\n<p>own language which every one understood.</p>\n<p>Now it only sounds like</p>\n",
        "<p>chirping, screeching, and whistling, and to some, like music without</p>\n<p>words.</p>\n<p>It came into the birds’ mind, however, that they would no longer be</p>\n<p>without a ruler, and would choose one of themselves to be King.</p>\n<p>One alone amongst them, the green plover, was opposed to this.</p>\n<p>He had</p>\n<p>lived free and would die free, and anxiously flying hither and thither,</p>\n",
        "<p>he cried, “Where shall I go?</p>\n<p>where shall I go?” He retired into a</p>\n<p>lonely and unfrequented marsh, and showed himself no more among his</p>\n<p>fellows.</p>\n<p>The birds now wished to discuss the matter, and on a fine May morning</p>\n<p>they all gathered together from the woods and fields: eagles and</p>\n<p>chaffinches, owls and crows, larks and sparrows, how can I name them</p>\n",
        "<p>all?</p>\n<p>Even the cuckoo came, and the hoopoe, his clerk, who is so called</p>\n<p>because he is always heard a few days before him, and a very small bird</p>\n<p>which as yet had no name, mingled with the band.</p>\n<p>The hen, which by some accident had heard nothing of the whole matter,</p>\n<p>was astonished at the great assemblage.</p>\n<p>“What, what, what is going to</p>\n",
        "<p>be done?” she cackled.</p>\n<p>But the cock calmed his beloved hen, and said,</p>\n<p>“Only rich people,” and told her what they had on hand.</p>\n<p>It was decided, however, that the one who could fly the highest should</p>\n<p>be King.</p>\n<p>A tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes, when he heard</p>\n<p>that, cried a warning, “No, no, no!</p>\n",
        "<p>no!” because he thought that many</p>\n<p>tears would be shed because of this.</p>\n<p>But the crow said, “Caw, caw,” and</p>\n<p>that all would pass off peaceably.</p>\n<p>It was now determined that, on this fine morning, they should at once</p>\n<p>begin to ascend, so that hereafter no one should be able to say, “I</p>\n<p>could easily have flown much higher, but the evening came on, and I</p>\n",
        "<p>could do no more.”</p>\n<p>On a given signal, therefore, the whole troop rose up in the air.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>dust ascended from the land, and there was tremendous fluttering and</p>\n<p>whirring and beating of wings.</p>\n<p>It looked as if a black cloud was rising</p>\n<p>up.</p>\n",
        "<p>The little birds were, however, soon left behind.</p>\n<p>They could go no</p>\n<p>farther, and fell back to the ground.</p>\n<p>The larger birds held out longer, but none could equal the eagle, who</p>\n<p>mounted so high that he could have picked the eyes out of the sun.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when he saw that the others could not get up to him, he thought, “Why</p>\n",
        "<p>should I fly any higher, I am the King?” and began to let himself down</p>\n<p>again.</p>\n<p>The birds beneath him at once cried to him, “You must be our King, no</p>\n<p>one has flown so high as you.”</p>\n<p>“Except me,” screamed the little fellow without a name, who had crept</p>\n<p>into the breast-feathers of the eagle.</p>\n<p>And as he was not at all tired,</p>\n",
        "<p>he rose up and mounted so high that he reached heaven itself.</p>\n<p>When,</p>\n<p>however, he had gone as far as this, he folded his wings together, and</p>\n<p>called down with clear and penetrating voice:</p>\n<p>“_I am King!</p>\n<p>I am King!_”</p>\n<p>“You, our King?” cried the birds angrily.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You have done this by trick</p>\n<p>and cunning!”</p>\n<p>So they made another condition.</p>\n<p>He should be King who could go down</p>\n<p>lowest in the ground.</p>\n<p>How the goose did flap about with its broad</p>\n<p>breast when it was once more on the land!</p>\n",
        "<p>How quickly the cock</p>\n<p>scratched a hole!</p>\n<p>The duck came off the worst of all, for she leapt</p>\n<p>into a ditch, but sprained her legs, and waddled away to a neighboring</p>\n<p>pond, crying, “Cheating, cheating!”</p>\n<p>The little bird without a name, however, sought out a mouse-hole,</p>\n<p>slipped down into it, and cried out of it, with his small voice:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_I am King!</p>\n<p>I am King!_”</p>\n<p>“You our King!” cried the birds still more angrily.</p>\n<p>“Do you think your</p>\n<p>cunning shall prevail?”</p>\n<p>They determined to keep him a prisoner in the hole and starve him out.</p>\n<p>The owl was placed as sentinel in front of it, and was not to let the</p>\n",
        "<p>rascal out if she had any value for her life.</p>\n<p>When evening was come all</p>\n<p>the birds were feeling very tired after exerting their wings so much</p>\n<p>that they went to bed with their wives and children.</p>\n<p>The owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole, gazing steadfastly</p>\n<p>into it with her great eyes.</p>\n<p>In the meantime she, too, had grown tired</p>\n",
        "<p>and thought to herself, “You might certainly shut one eye, you will</p>\n<p>still watch with the other, and the little miscreant shall not come out</p>\n<p>of his hole.” So she shut one eye, and with the other looked straight</p>\n<p>at the mouse-hole.</p>\n<p>The little fellow put his head out and peeped, and wanted to slip away,</p>\n<p>but the owl came forward, and he drew his head back.</p>\n<p>Then the owl</p>\n",
        "<p>opened the one eye again, and shut the other, intending to shut them in</p>\n<p>turn all through the night.</p>\n<p>But when she next shut the one eye, she forgot to open the other.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>as soon as both her eyes were shut, she fell asleep.</p>\n<p>The little fellow</p>\n<p>soon saw that, and slipped away.</p>\n",
        "<p>From that day forth, the owl has never dared to show herself by</p>\n<p>daylight, for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her</p>\n<p>feathers out.</p>\n<p>She only flies out by night, but hates and pursues mice</p>\n<p>because they make such ugly holes.</p>\n<p>The little bird, too, is very unwilling to let himself be seen, because</p>\n<p>he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught.</p>\n",
        "<p>He steals</p>\n<p>about in the hedges, and when he is quite safe, he sometimes cries, “I</p>\n<p>am King,” and for this reason, the other birds call him in mockery,</p>\n<p>“Hedge-King.”</p>\n<p>No one, however, was so happy as the lark at not having to obey the</p>\n<p>little King.</p>\n<p>As soon as the sun appears, she ascends high in the air</p>\n",
        "<p>and cries, “Ah, how beautiful that is!</p>\n<p>beautiful that is!</p>\n<p>beautiful,</p>\n<p>beautiful!</p>\n<p>ah, how beautiful that is!”</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>ONE-EYE, TWO-EYES, AND THREE-EYES</h3>\n",
        "<p>There was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom</p>\n<p>was called One-Eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her</p>\n<p>forehead, and the second, Two-Eyes, because she had two eyes like other</p>\n<p>folks, and the youngest, Three-Eyes, because she had three eyes; and</p>\n<p>her third eye was in the centre of her forehead.</p>\n<p>Now, as Two-Eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters and</p>\n<p>her mother could not endure her.</p>\n",
        "<p>They said to her, “You, with your two</p>\n<p>eyes, are no better than common folk.</p>\n<p>You do not belong to us!”</p>\n<p>They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her, and gave her</p>\n<p>nothing to eat but what they left, and did everything that they could</p>\n<p>to make her unhappy.</p>\n<p>It came to pass that Two-Eyes had to go out into the fields and tend</p>\n",
        "<p>the goat, but she was still very hungry, because her sisters had given</p>\n<p>her so little to eat.</p>\n<p>She sat down on a ridge and began to weep, and so</p>\n<p>bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes.</p>\n<p>And one day, when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing</p>\n<p>beside her, who said, “Why are you weeping, little Two-Eyes?”</p>\n<p>Two-Eyes answered, “Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes</p>\n",
        "<p>like other people, and my sisters and mother hate me for it, and push</p>\n<p>me from one corner to another, throw old clothes at me, and give me</p>\n<p>nothing to eat but the scraps they leave?</p>\n<p>To-day, they have given me so</p>\n<p>little that I am still very hungry.”</p>\n<p>Then the Wise Woman said, “Wipe away your tears, Two-Eyes, and I will</p>\n<p>tell you something to stop your ever suffering from hunger again; just</p>\n",
        "<p>say to your goat:</p>\n<p>“‘_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,</p>\n<p>Cover the table with something to eat!_’</p>\n<p>and then a clean well-spread little table will stand before you, with</p>\n<p>the most delicious food upon it, of which you may eat as much as you</p>\n<p>are inclined.</p>\n<p>And when you have had enough, and have no more need of</p>\n",
        "<p>the little table, just say:</p>\n<p>“‘_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,</p>\n<p>And take the table quite away!_’</p>\n<p>and then it will vanish again from your sight.”</p>\n<p>Hereupon the Wise Woman departed.</p>\n<p>But Two-Eyes thought, “I must instantly make a trial, and see if what</p>\n<p>she said is true, for I am far too hungry,” and she said:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,</p>\n<p>Cover the table with something to eat!_”</p>\n<p>and scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered with</p>\n<p>a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a knife</p>\n<p>and fork, and a silver spoon; and the most delicious food was there</p>\n<p>also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Then Two-Eyes said a little prayer she knew, “Lord God, be with us</p>\n",
        "<p>always, Amen,” and helped herself to some food, and enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when she was satisfied, she said, as the Wise Woman had taught her:</p>\n<p>“_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,</p>\n<p>And take the table quite away!_”</p>\n<p>and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.</p>\n<p>“That is a delightful way of keeping house!” thought Two-Eyes, and was</p>\n",
        "<p>quite glad and happy.</p>\n<p>In the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small</p>\n<p>earthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for</p>\n<p>her, but she did not touch it.</p>\n<p>Next day, she again went out with her</p>\n<p>goat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to</p>\n<p>her, lying untouched.</p>\n",
        "<p>The first and second time that she did this, her sisters did not notice</p>\n<p>it, but as it happened every time, they did observe it, and said,</p>\n<p>“There is something wrong about Two-Eyes, she always leaves her food</p>\n<p>untasted.</p>\n<p>She used to eat up everything that was given her.</p>\n<p>She must</p>\n<p>have discovered other ways of getting food.”</p>\n",
        "<p>In order that they might learn the truth, they resolved to send One-Eye</p>\n<p>with Two-Eyes, when she went to drive her goat to the pasture, to watch</p>\n<p>what Two-Eyes did while she was there, and whether any one brought</p>\n<p>her things to eat and drink.</p>\n<p>So when Two-Eyes set out the next time,</p>\n<p>One-Eye went to her and said, “I will go with you to the pasture, and</p>\n<p>see that the goat is well taken care of, and driven where there is</p>\n",
        "<p>food.”</p>\n<p>But Two-Eyes knew what was in One-Eye’s mind, and drove the goat into</p>\n<p>high grass and said, “Come, One-Eye, we will sit down, and I will sing</p>\n<p>something to you.”</p>\n<p>One-Eye sat down, and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and the heat</p>\n<p>of the sun, and Two-Eyes sang constantly:</p>\n<p>“_One-Eye, wakest thou?</p>\n",
        "<p>One-Eye, sleepest thou?_”</p>\n<p>until One-Eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep.</p>\n<p>As soon as Two-Eyes</p>\n<p>saw that One-Eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said:</p>\n<p>“_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,</p>\n<p>Cover the table with something to eat!_”</p>\n<p>and seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was</p>\n",
        "<p>satisfied.</p>\n<p>Then she again cried:</p>\n<p>“_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,</p>\n<p>And take the table quite away!_”</p>\n<p>and in an instant all was gone.</p>\n<p>Two-Eyes now awakened One-Eye, and said, “One-Eye, you want to take</p>\n<p>care of the goat, and yet go to sleep while you are doing it!</p>\n",
        "<p>In the</p>\n<p>meantime, the goat might run all over the world.</p>\n<p>Come, let us go home</p>\n<p>again.”</p>\n<p>So they went home, and again Two-Eyes let her little dish stand</p>\n<p>untouched, and One-Eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat</p>\n<p>it, and to excuse herself said, “I fell asleep when I was out.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Next day, the mother said to Three-Eyes, “This time you shall go and</p>\n<p>watch if Two-Eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches</p>\n<p>her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.”</p>\n<p>So Three-Eyes went to Two-Eyes, and said, “I will go with you and see</p>\n<p>if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.”</p>\n<p>But Two-Eyes knew what was in Three-Eyes’ mind, and drove the goat into</p>\n<p>high grass and said, “We will sit down, and I will sing something to</p>\n",
        "<p>you, Three-Eyes.”</p>\n<p>Three-Eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of</p>\n<p>the sun, and Two-Eyes began the same song as before, and sang:</p>\n<p>“_Three-Eyes, are you waking?_”</p>\n<p>but then, instead of singing,</p>\n<p>“_Three-Eyes, are you sleeping?_”</p>\n<p>as she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?_”</p>\n<p>and sang all the time,</p>\n<p>“_Three-Eyes, are you waking?</p>\n<p>Two-Eyes, are you sleeping?_”</p>\n<p>Then two of the eyes which Three-Eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but</p>\n<p>the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep.</p>\n<p>It is</p>\n",
        "<p>true that Three-Eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it</p>\n<p>was asleep too.</p>\n<p>But it blinked, and could see everything very well.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>when Two-Eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her</p>\n<p>little charm:</p>\n<p>“_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,</p>\n",
        "<p>Cover the table with something to eat!_”</p>\n<p>and ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the</p>\n<p>table to go away again:</p>\n<p>“_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,</p>\n<p>And take the table quite away!_”</p>\n<p>and Three-Eyes had seen everything.</p>\n<p>Then Two-Eyes came to her, waked her and said, “Have you been asleep,</p>\n",
        "<p>Three-Eyes?</p>\n<p>You are a good caretaker!</p>\n<p>Come, we will go home.”</p>\n<p>And when they got home, Two-Eyes again did not eat, and Three-Eyes said</p>\n<p>to the mother, “Now, I know why that proud thing there does not eat.</p>\n<p>When she is out, she says to the goat:</p>\n<p>“‘_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, bleat,</p>\n",
        "<p>Cover the table with something to eat!_’</p>\n<p>and then a little table appears before her covered with the best of</p>\n<p>food, much better than any we have here.</p>\n<p>When she has eaten all she</p>\n<p>wants, she says:</p>\n<p>“‘_Bleat, bleat, my little Goat, I pray,</p>\n<p>And take the table quite away!_’</p>\n",
        "<p>and all disappears.</p>\n<p>I watched everything closely.</p>\n<p>She put two of my</p>\n<p>eyes to sleep by using a charm, but luckily the one in my forehead kept</p>\n<p>awake.”</p>\n<p>Then the envious mother cried, “Do you want to fare better than we do?</p>\n<p>The desire shall pass away!” and she fetched a butcher’s knife, and</p>\n",
        "<p>thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead.</p>\n<p>When Two-Eyes saw that, full of sorrow, she went outside, and seated</p>\n<p>herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter</p>\n<p>tears.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the Wise Woman once more stood by her side, and said,</p>\n<p>“Two-Eyes, why are you weeping?”</p>\n<p>“Have I not reason to weep?” she answered.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The goat, which covered the</p>\n<p>table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my</p>\n<p>mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.”</p>\n<p>The Wise Woman said, “Two-Eyes, I will give you a piece of good advice.</p>\n<p>Ask your sisters to give you the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and</p>\n<p>bury them in the ground in front of the house, and your fortune will be</p>\n<p>made.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then she vanished, and Two-Eyes went home and said to her sisters,</p>\n<p>“Dear Sisters, do give me some part of my goat.</p>\n<p>I don’t wish for what</p>\n<p>is good, but give me the entrails.”</p>\n<p>Then they laughed and said, “If that’s all you want, you may have it.”</p>\n<p>So Two-Eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly, at evening, in</p>\n<p>front of the house-door, as the Wise Woman had counseled her to do.</p>\n",
        "<p>Next morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there</p>\n<p>stood a wonderful, magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit</p>\n<p>of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was</p>\n<p>nothing more beautiful or precious.</p>\n<p>They did not know how the tree</p>\n<p>could have come there during the night, but Two-Eyes saw that it had</p>\n<p>grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the</p>\n",
        "<p>exact spot where she had buried them.</p>\n<p>Then the mother said to One-Eye, “Climb up, my Child, and gather some</p>\n<p>of the fruit of the tree for us.”</p>\n<p>One-Eye climbed up, but when she was about to lay hold of one of the</p>\n<p>golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands.</p>\n<p>And that happened</p>\n<p>each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what</p>\n",
        "<p>she might.</p>\n<p>Then said the mother, “Three-Eyes, do you climb up.</p>\n<p>You with your three</p>\n<p>eyes can look about you better than One-Eye.”</p>\n<p>One-Eye slipped down, and Three-Eyes climbed up.</p>\n<p>Three-Eyes was not</p>\n<p>more skillful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples</p>\n",
        "<p>always escaped her.</p>\n<p>At length, the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could</p>\n<p>grasp the fruit no better than One-Eye and Three-Eyes, for she always</p>\n<p>clutched empty air.</p>\n<p>Then said Two-Eyes, “I will go up, perhaps I may succeed better.”</p>\n<p>The sisters cried, “You, indeed, with your two eyes!</p>\n<p>What can you do?”</p>\n",
        "<p>But Two-Eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did not get out of her</p>\n<p>way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could</p>\n<p>pluck them one after the other.</p>\n<p>And she brought a whole apronful down</p>\n<p>with her.</p>\n<p>The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating</p>\n<p>poor Two-Eyes any better for this, she and One-Eye and Three-Eyes were</p>\n",
        "<p>only envious, because Two-Eyes alone had been able to get the fruit.</p>\n<p>They treated her still more cruelly.</p>\n<p>It so befell that once, when they were all standing together by the</p>\n<p>tree, a young Knight came up.</p>\n<p>“Quick, Two-Eyes,” cried the two sisters,</p>\n<p>“creep under this and don’t disgrace us!” and with all speed they</p>\n<p>turned an empty barrel, which was standing close by the tree, over</p>\n",
        "<p>poor Two-Eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been</p>\n<p>gathering, under it too.</p>\n<p>When the Knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and</p>\n<p>admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two</p>\n<p>sisters, “To whom does this fine tree belong?</p>\n<p>Any one who will bestow</p>\n<p>one branch of it on me may, in return for it, ask whatsoever he</p>\n",
        "<p>desires.”</p>\n<p>Then One-Eye and Three-Eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and</p>\n<p>that they would give him a branch.</p>\n<p>They both tried very hard, but they</p>\n<p>were not able to do it, for every time the branches and fruit moved</p>\n<p>away from them.</p>\n<p>Then said the Knight, “It is very strange that the tree should belong</p>\n",
        "<p>to you, and yet you should still not be able to break a piece off.”</p>\n<p>They again insisted that the tree was their property.</p>\n<p>Whilst they were</p>\n<p>saying so, Two-Eyes rolled a couple of golden apples from under the</p>\n<p>barrel to the feet of the Knight, for she was vexed with One-Eye and</p>\n<p>Three-Eyes, for not speaking the truth.</p>\n<p>When the Knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked from whence</p>\n",
        "<p>they came.</p>\n<p>One-Eye and Three-Eyes answered that they had another</p>\n<p>sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes</p>\n<p>like any common person.</p>\n<p>The Knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, “Two-Eyes, come</p>\n<p>hither!”</p>\n<p>Then Two-Eyes, quite cheered, came from beneath the barrel, and the</p>\n",
        "<p>Knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, “You, Two-Eyes, can</p>\n<p>certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” replied Two-Eyes, “that I certainly shall be able to do, for the</p>\n<p>tree belongs to me.” And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease</p>\n<p>broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and</p>\n<p>gave it to the Knight.</p>\n<p>Then said the Knight, “Two-Eyes, what shall I give you for it?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Alas!” answered Two-Eyes, “I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and</p>\n<p>want, from early morning till late night.</p>\n<p>If you would take me with</p>\n<p>you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.”</p>\n<p>So the Knight lifted Two-Eyes on his horse, and took her home with</p>\n<p>him to his father’s castle.</p>\n<p>There he gave her beautiful clothes and</p>\n",
        "<p>meat and drink to her heart’s content.</p>\n<p>And as he loved her so much he</p>\n<p>married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing.</p>\n<p>When Two-Eyes was thus carried away by the handsome Knight, her two</p>\n<p>sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest.</p>\n<p>“The wonderful</p>\n<p>tree, however, remains with us,” thought they, “and even if we can</p>\n",
        "<p>gather no fruit from it, every one will stand still and look at it, and</p>\n<p>come to us and admire it.</p>\n<p>Who knows what good things may be in store</p>\n<p>for us?”</p>\n<p>But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at</p>\n<p>an end.</p>\n<p>And when Two-Eyes looked out of the window of her own little</p>\n",
        "<p>room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it.</p>\n<p>And so it</p>\n<p>had followed her.</p>\n<p>Two-Eyes lived a long time in happiness.</p>\n<p>One day, two poor women came</p>\n<p>to her castle, and begged for alms.</p>\n<p>She looked in their faces, and</p>\n",
        "<p>recognized her sisters, One-Eye, and Three-Eyes, who had fallen into</p>\n<p>such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from</p>\n<p>door to door.</p>\n<p>Two-Eyes made them welcome, and was kind to them, and</p>\n<p>took care of them, so that they both, with all their hearts, repented</p>\n<p>of the evil that they had done in their youth to their sister.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n",
        "<h3>THE GOOSE-GIRL AT THE WELL</h3>\n<p>_The Old Witch_</p>\n<p>There was once upon a time, a very old woman, who lived with her flock</p>\n<p>of geese in a waste place among the mountains, and there had a little</p>\n<p>house.</p>\n<p>The waste was surrounded by a large forest, and every morning</p>\n<p>the Old Woman took her crutch and hobbled into it.</p>\n",
        "<p>There, however, the dame was quite active, more so than any one would</p>\n<p>have thought, considering her age, and collected grass for her geese,</p>\n<p>picked all the wild fruit she could reach, and carried everything home</p>\n<p>on her back.</p>\n<p>Any one would have thought that the heavy load would have</p>\n<p>weighed her to the ground, but she always brought it safely home.</p>\n<p>If any one met her, she greeted him quite courteously.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Good day, dear</p>\n<p>Countryman, it is a fine day.</p>\n<p>Ah!</p>\n<p>you wonder that I should drag grass</p>\n<p>about, but every one must take his burthen on his back.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, people did not like to meet her if they could help it,</p>\n<p>and took by preference a roundabout way.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when a father with his</p>\n<p>boys passed her, he whispered to them, “Beware of the Old Woman.</p>\n<p>She</p>\n<p>has claws beneath her gloves.</p>\n<p>She is a Witch.”</p>\n<p>One morning, a handsome young man was going through the forest.</p>\n<p>The sun</p>\n",
        "<p>shone bright, the birds sang, a cool breeze crept through the leaves,</p>\n<p>and he was full of joy and gladness.</p>\n<p>He had as yet met no one, when he</p>\n<p>suddenly perceived the old Witch kneeling on the ground cutting grass</p>\n<p>with a sickle.</p>\n<p>She had already thrust a whole load into her cloth, and</p>\n<p>near it stood two baskets, which were filled with wild apples and pears.</p>\n",
        "<p>“But, good little Mother,” said he, “how can you carry all that away?”</p>\n<p>“I must carry it, dear Sir,” answered she; “rich folk’s children have</p>\n<p>no need to do such things, but with the peasant folk the saying goes,</p>\n<p>‘Don’t look behind you, you will only see how crooked your back is!’</p>\n<p>“Will you help me?” she said, as he remained standing by her.</p>\n<p>“You have</p>\n<p>still a straight back and young legs, it would be a trifle to you.</p>\n",
        "<p>Besides, my house is not so very far from here.</p>\n<p>It stands there on the</p>\n<p>heath behind the hill.</p>\n<p>How soon you would bound up thither!”</p>\n<p>The young man took compassion on the Old Woman.</p>\n<p>“My father is certainly</p>\n<p>no peasant,” replied he, “but a rich Count.</p>\n",
        "<p>Nevertheless, that you may</p>\n<p>see it is not only peasants who can carry things, I will take your</p>\n<p>bundle.”</p>\n<p>“If you will try it,” said she, “I shall be very glad.</p>\n<p>You will</p>\n<p>certainly have to walk for an hour, but what will that signify to you?</p>\n<p>Only you must carry the apples and pears as well.”</p>\n",
        "<p>It now seemed to the young man just a little serious, when he heard</p>\n<p>of an hour’s walk, but the Old Woman would not let him off, packed the</p>\n<p>bundle on his back, and hung the two baskets on his arm.</p>\n<p>“See, it is</p>\n<p>quite light,” said she.</p>\n<p>“No, it is not light,” answered the Count, and pulled a rueful</p>\n<p>face.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Verily, the bundle weighs as heavily as if it were full of</p>\n<p>cobblestones, and the apples and pears are as heavy as lead!</p>\n<p>I can</p>\n<p>scarcely breathe.”</p>\n<p>He had a mind to put everything down again, but the Old Woman would</p>\n<p>not allow it.</p>\n<p>“Just look,” said she mockingly, “the young gentleman</p>\n",
        "<p>will not carry what I, an old woman, have so often dragged along!</p>\n<p>You</p>\n<p>are ready with fine words, but when it comes to being in earnest, you</p>\n<p>want to take to your heels.</p>\n<p>Why are you standing loitering there?” she</p>\n<p>continued.</p>\n<p>“Step out.</p>\n",
        "<p>No one will take the bundle off again.”</p>\n<p>As long as he walked on level ground, it was still bearable, but when</p>\n<p>they came to the hill and had to climb, and the stones rolled down</p>\n<p>under his feet as if they were alive, it was beyond his strength.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>drops of perspiration stood on his forehead, and ran, hot and cold,</p>\n<p>down his back.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Dame,” said he, “I can go no farther.</p>\n<p>I want to rest a little.”</p>\n<p>“Not here,” answered the Old Woman, “when we have arrived at our</p>\n<p>journey’s end, you can rest.</p>\n<p>But now you must go forward.</p>\n<p>Who knows</p>\n<p>what good it may do you?”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Old woman, you are shameless!” said the Count, and tried to throw off</p>\n<p>the bundle, but he labored in vain.</p>\n<p>It stuck as fast to his back, as if</p>\n<p>it grew there.</p>\n<p>He turned and twisted, but he could not get rid of it.</p>\n<p>The Old Woman laughed at this, and sprang about quite delighted on her</p>\n<p>crutch.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Don’t get angry, dear Sir,” said she, “you are growing as red</p>\n<p>in the face as a turkey-cock!</p>\n<p>Carry your bundle patiently.</p>\n<p>I will give</p>\n<p>you a good present when we get home.”</p>\n<p>What could he do?</p>\n<p>He was obliged to submit to his fate, and crawl</p>\n",
        "<p>along patiently behind the Old Woman.</p>\n<p>She seemed to grow more and more</p>\n<p>nimble, and his burden still heavier.</p>\n<p>All at once, she made a spring,</p>\n<p>jumped on to the bundle and seated herself on the top of it.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>however withered she might be, she was yet heavier than the stoutest</p>\n",
        "<p>country lass.</p>\n<p>The youth’s knees trembled, but when he did not go on, the Old Woman</p>\n<p>hit him about the legs with a switch and with stinging-nettles.</p>\n<p>Groaning continually, he climbed the mountain, and at length reached</p>\n<p>the Old Woman’s house, when he was just about to drop.</p>\n<p>When the geese perceived the Old Woman, they flapped their wings,</p>\n<p>stretched out their necks, ran to meet her, cackling all the while.</p>\n",
        "<p>Behind the flock walked, stick in hand, an old wench, strong and big,</p>\n<p>but ugly as night.</p>\n<p>“Good Mother,” said she to the Old Woman, “has</p>\n<p>anything happened to you, you have stayed away so long?”</p>\n<p>“By no means, my dear Daughter,” answered she, “I have met with nothing</p>\n<p>bad, but, on the contrary, with this kind gentleman, who has carried</p>\n<p>my burthen for me.</p>\n",
        "<p>Only think, he even took me on his back when I was</p>\n<p>tired.</p>\n<p>The way, too, has not seemed long to us.</p>\n<p>We have been merry, and</p>\n<p>have been cracking jokes with each other all the time.”</p>\n<p>At last the Old Woman slid down, took the bundle off the young man’s</p>\n<p>back, and the baskets from his arm, looked at him quite kindly, and</p>\n",
        "<p>said, “Now seat yourself on the bench before the door, and rest.</p>\n<p>You</p>\n<p>have fairly earned your wages, and they shall not be wanting.”</p>\n<p>Then she said to the goose-girl, “Go into the house, my little</p>\n<p>Daughter, it is not becoming for you to be alone with a young</p>\n<p>gentleman.</p>\n<p>One must not pour oil on to the fire, he might fall in love</p>\n",
        "<p>with you.”</p>\n<p>The Count knew not whether to laugh or to cry.</p>\n<p>“Such a sweetheart as</p>\n<p>that,” thought he, “could not touch my heart, even if she were thirty</p>\n<p>years younger.”</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the Old Woman stroked and fondled her geese as if they</p>\n<p>were children, and then went into the house with her daughter.</p>\n",
        "<p>The</p>\n<p>youth lay down on the bench, under a wild apple-tree.</p>\n<p>The air was warm</p>\n<p>and mild.</p>\n<p>On all sides stretched a green meadow, which was set with</p>\n<p>cowslips, wild thyme, and a thousand other flowers.</p>\n<p>Through the midst</p>\n",
        "<p>of it rippled a clear brook on which the sun sparkled, and the white</p>\n<p>geese went walking backward and forward, or paddled in the water.</p>\n<p>“It is quite delightful here,” said he, “but I am so tired that I</p>\n<p>cannot keep my eyes open.</p>\n<p>I will sleep a little.</p>\n<p>If only a gust of wind</p>\n<p>does not come and blow my legs off my body, for they are as brittle as</p>\n",
        "<p>tinder.”</p>\n<p>When he had slept a little while, the Old Woman came and shook him till</p>\n<p>he awoke.</p>\n<p>“Sit up,” said she, “you cannot stay here.</p>\n<p>I have certainly</p>\n<p>treated you badly, still it has not cost you your life.</p>\n<p>Of money and</p>\n",
        "<p>land you have no need, here is something else for you.”</p>\n<p>Thereupon she thrust a little book into his hand, which was cut out of</p>\n<p>a single emerald.</p>\n<p>“Take great care of it,” said she, “it will bring you</p>\n<p>good fortune.”</p>\n<p>The Count sprang up, and as he felt that he was quite fresh, and had</p>\n<p>recovered his vigor, he thanked the Old Woman for her present, and set</p>\n",
        "<p>off without even once looking back at the beautiful daughter.</p>\n<p>When he</p>\n<p>was already some way off, he still heard in the distance the noisy cry</p>\n<p>of the geese.</p>\n<p>For three days, the Count had to wander in the wilderness before he</p>\n<p>could find his way out.</p>\n<p>He then reached a large town.</p>\n",
        "<p>As no one knew</p>\n<p>him, he was led into the royal palace, where the King and Queen were</p>\n<p>sitting on their throne.</p>\n<p>The Count fell on one knee, drew the emerald</p>\n<p>book out of his pocket, and laid it at the Queen’s feet.</p>\n<p>She bade him</p>\n<p>rise and hand her the little book.</p>\n",
        "<p>Hardly, however, had she opened it, and looked therein, than she fell</p>\n<p>as if dead to the ground.</p>\n<p>The Count was seized by the King’s servants,</p>\n<p>and was being led to prison, when the Queen opened her eyes, and</p>\n<p>ordered them to release him, and every one was to go out, as she wished</p>\n<p>to speak with him in private.</p>\n<p>When the Queen was alone, she began to weep bitterly, and said, “Of</p>\n",
        "<p>what use to me are the splendors and honors with which I am surrounded!</p>\n<p>Every morning I awake in pain and sorrow.</p>\n<p>I had three daughters, the</p>\n<p>youngest of whom was so beautiful, that the whole world looked on her</p>\n<p>as a wonder.</p>\n<p>She was as white as snow, as rosy as apple-blossoms, and</p>\n<p>her hair as radiant as sunbeams.</p>\n",
        "<p>When she cried, not tears fell from</p>\n<p>her eyes, but pearls and jewels only.</p>\n<p>“When she was fifteen years old, the King summoned all three sisters</p>\n<p>to come before his throne.</p>\n<p>You should have seen how all the people</p>\n<p>gazed when the youngest entered.</p>\n<p>It was just as if the sun were rising!</p>\n",
        "<p>Then the King spoke, ‘My Daughters, I know not when my last hour may</p>\n<p>arrive.</p>\n<p>I will to-day decide what each shall receive at my death.</p>\n<p>You</p>\n<p>all love me, but the one of you who loves me best, shall fare the best.’</p>\n<p>“Each of them said she loved him best.</p>\n<p>‘Can you not express to me,’</p>\n",
        "<p>said the King, ‘how much you do love me, and thus I shall see what you</p>\n<p>mean?’</p>\n<p>“The eldest spoke.</p>\n<p>‘I love my Father as dearly as the sweetest sugar.’</p>\n<p>The second, ‘I love my Father as dearly as my prettiest dress.’ But the</p>\n<p>youngest was silent.</p>\n<p>“Then the father said, ‘And you, my dearest Child, how much do you love</p>\n",
        "<p>me?’ ‘I do not know, and can compare my love with nothing.’ But her</p>\n<p>father insisted that she should name something.</p>\n<p>So she said at last,</p>\n<p>‘The best food does not please me without salt, therefore I love my</p>\n<p>Father like salt.’</p>\n<p>“When the King heard that, he fell into a passion and said, ‘If you</p>\n<p>love me like salt, your love shall also be repaid with salt.’</p>\n",
        "<p>“Then he divided the kingdom between the two elder, but caused a sack</p>\n<p>of salt to be bound on the back of the youngest, and two servants had</p>\n<p>to lead her forth into the wild forest.</p>\n<p>“We all begged and prayed for her,” said the Queen, “but the King’s</p>\n<p>anger was not to be appeased.</p>\n<p>How she cried when she had to leave us!</p>\n<p>The whole road was strewn with the pearls which flowed from her eyes.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The King soon afterward repented of his great severity, and had the</p>\n<p>whole forest searched for the poor child, but no one could find her.</p>\n<p>When I think that the wild beasts have devoured her, I know not how to</p>\n<p>contain myself for sorrow.</p>\n<p>Many a time I console myself with the hope</p>\n<p>that she is still alive, and may have hidden herself in a cave, or has</p>\n<p>found shelter with compassionate people.</p>\n",

        "<p>Every night, when they were in them, the King locked the door, and</p>\n<p>bolted it.</p>\n<p>But in the morning, when he unlocked the door, he saw that</p>\n<p>their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how</p>\n<p>that had happened.</p>\n<p>Then the King caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover</p>\n<p>where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and</p>\n",
        "<p>be King after his death.</p>\n<p>But that whosoever came forward and had not</p>\n<p>discovered it within three days and nights, should forfeit his life.</p>\n<p>It was not long before a King’s Son presented himself, and offered to</p>\n<p>undertake the enterprise.</p>\n<p>He was well received, and in the evening was</p>\n<p>led into a room adjoining the Princesses’ sleeping-chamber.</p>\n",
        "<p>His bed</p>\n<p>was placed there, and he was to watch where they went and danced.</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other</p>\n<p>place, the door of their room was left open.</p>\n<p>But the eyelids of the Prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep.</p>\n<p>When he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for</p>\n",
        "<p>their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles.</p>\n<p>On the second and third nights it fell out just the same, and then his</p>\n<p>head was struck off without mercy.</p>\n<p>Many others came after this and</p>\n<p>undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives.</p>\n<p>Now, it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could</p>\n<p>serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the King</p>\n",
        "<p>lived.</p>\n<p>There he met an Old Woman, who asked him where he was going.</p>\n<p>“I hardly know myself,” answered he, and added in jest, “I had half a</p>\n<p>mind to discover where the Princesses danced their shoes into holes,</p>\n<p>and thus become King.”</p>\n<p>“That is not so difficult,” said the Old Woman, “you must not drink the</p>\n<p>wine which will be brought to you at night.”</p>\n",
        "<p>With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, “If you put on that,</p>\n<p>you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve.”</p>\n<p>When the soldier had received this good advice, he took heart, went to</p>\n<p>the King, and announced himself as a suitor.</p>\n<p>He was as well received as</p>\n<p>the others, and royal garments were put upon him.</p>\n<p>He was conducted that evening, at bedtime, into the outer-chamber, and</p>\n",
        "<p>as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of</p>\n<p>wine.</p>\n<p>He lay down, but did not drink the wine.</p>\n<p>The Twelve Princesses, in their chamber, laughed, and the eldest said,</p>\n<p>“He, too, might as well have saved his life.”</p>\n<p>With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and</p>\n<p>brought out pretty dresses; dressed themselves before the mirrors,</p>\n",
        "<p>sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance.</p>\n<p>Only the youngest said, “I know not how it is.</p>\n<p>You are very happy, but</p>\n<p>I feel strange.</p>\n<p>Some misfortune is certainly about to befall us.”</p>\n<p>“You are a goose, who are always frightened,” said the eldest.</p>\n<p>“Have</p>\n",
        "<p>you forgotten how many King’s Sons have already come here in vain?</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught.</p>\n<p>In any</p>\n<p>case, the clown would not have awakened.”</p>\n<p>When they were all ready, the eldest then went to her bed and tapped it.</p>\n<p>It immediately sank into the earth; and one after the other they</p>\n",
        "<p>descended through the opening, the eldest going first.</p>\n<p>The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his</p>\n<p>little cloak, and went down last with the youngest.</p>\n<p>Half-way down the</p>\n<p>steps, he just trod a little on her dress.</p>\n<p>She was terrified at that, and cried out, “What is that?</p>\n<p>who is pulling</p>\n",
        "<p>at my dress?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be so silly!” said the eldest, “you have caught it on a nail.”</p>\n<p>Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they</p>\n<p>were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves</p>\n<p>of which were of silver, and shone and glistened.</p>\n<p>The soldier thought,</p>\n<p>“I must carry a token away with me,” and broke off a twig from one of</p>\n",
        "<p>them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report.</p>\n<p>The youngest cried out again, “Something is wrong, did you hear the</p>\n<p>crack?”</p>\n<p>But the eldest said, “It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got</p>\n<p>rid of our Prince so quickly.”</p>\n<p>After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold,</p>\n<p>and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds.</p>\n",
        "<p>He broke</p>\n<p>off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the</p>\n<p>youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still declared that</p>\n<p>they were salutes.</p>\n<p>They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little</p>\n<p>boats, and in every boat sat a handsome Prince, all of whom were</p>\n<p>waiting for the Twelve Princesses.</p>\n",
        "<p>Each took one of them with him, but</p>\n<p>the soldier seated himself by the youngest.</p>\n<p>Then her Prince said, “I can’t tell why the boat is so much heavier</p>\n<p>to-day.</p>\n<p>I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it</p>\n<p>across.”</p>\n<p>“What should cause that,” said the youngest, “but the warm weather?</p>\n",
        "<p>I</p>\n<p>feel very warm too.”</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit castle,</p>\n<p>from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums.</p>\n<p>They rowed thither, entered, and each Prince danced with the maiden he</p>\n<p>loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen.</p>\n<p>And when one of them</p>\n",
        "<p>had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the cup was empty</p>\n<p>when she carried it to her mouth.</p>\n<p>The youngest was alarmed at this, but</p>\n<p>the eldest always made her be silent.</p>\n<p>They danced there till three o’clock in the morning, when all the shoes</p>\n<p>were danced into holes, and they were forced to leave off.</p>\n<p>The Princes</p>\n",
        "<p>rowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated</p>\n<p>himself by the eldest.</p>\n<p>On the shore they took leave of their Princes,</p>\n<p>and promised to return the following night.</p>\n<p>When they reached the stairs, the soldier ran on in front and lay down</p>\n<p>in his bed, and when the Twelve Princesses had come up slowly and</p>\n<p>wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear him,</p>\n",
        "<p>and they said, “So far as he is concerned, we are safe.”</p>\n<p>They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the worn-out</p>\n<p>shoes under the bed, and lay down.</p>\n<p>Next morning, the soldier was</p>\n<p>resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings on, and that</p>\n<p>night again went with them.</p>\n<p>Then everything was done just as it had</p>\n",
        "<p>been done the first time, and they danced until their shoes were worn</p>\n<p>to pieces.</p>\n<p>But the third time, he took a cup away with him as a token.</p>\n<p>When the hour had arrived for him to give his answer, he took the three</p>\n<p>twigs and the cup, and went to the King, but the Twelve Princesses</p>\n<p>stood behind the door, and listened for what he was going to say.</p>\n<p>When the King put the question, “Where have my Twelve Daughters danced</p>\n",
        "<p>their shoes to pieces in the night?” he answered, “In an underground</p>\n<p>castle with Twelve Princes,” and related how it had come to pass, and</p>\n<p>brought out the tokens.</p>\n<p>The King then summoned his daughters, and asked them if the soldier had</p>\n<p>told the truth, and when they saw that they were betrayed, and that</p>\n<p>falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged to confess all.</p>\n<p>Thereupon the King asked which of them he would have for his wife?</p>\n",
        "<p>He answered, “I am no longer young, so give me the eldest.”</p>\n<p>Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom</p>\n<p>was promised him after the King’s death.</p>\n<p>But the Princes were bewitched</p>\n<p>for as many days more as they had danced nights with the Twelve.</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>THE NIX OF THE MILL-POND</h3>\n",
        "<p>There was once upon a time, a miller who lived with his wife in great</p>\n<p>contentment.</p>\n<p>They had money and land, and their prosperity increased</p>\n<p>year by year more and more.</p>\n<p>But ill-luck comes like a thief in the</p>\n<p>night, as their wealth had increased so did it again decrease, year by</p>\n<p>year.</p>\n",
        "<p>At last the miller could hardly call the mill in which he lived his</p>\n<p>own.</p>\n<p>He was in great distress, and when he lay down after his day’s</p>\n<p>work, found no rest, but full of care, tossed about in his bed.</p>\n<p>One morning, he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air,</p>\n<p>thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter.</p>\n<p>As he</p>\n",
        "<p>was stepping over the mill-dam, the first sunbeam was just breaking</p>\n<p>forth, and he heard a rippling sound in the pond.</p>\n<p>He turned round and</p>\n<p>perceived a beautiful woman, rising slowly out of the water.</p>\n<p>Her long</p>\n<p>hair, which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands, fell</p>\n<p>down on both sides, and covered her white body.</p>\n",
        "<p>He saw that she was the Nix of the Mill-pond, and in his fright did not</p>\n<p>know whether he should run away or stay where he was.</p>\n<p>But the Nix made her sweet voice heard, called him by his name, and</p>\n<p>asked him why he was so sad?</p>\n<p>The miller was at first struck dumb, but</p>\n<p>when he heard her speak so kindly, he took heart, and told her how he</p>\n<p>had formerly lived in wealth and happiness, but that now he was so poor</p>\n",
        "<p>that he did not know what to do.</p>\n<p>“Be easy,” answered the Nix, “I will make you richer and happier than</p>\n<p>you have ever been before, only you must promise to give me the young</p>\n<p>thing which has just been born in your house.”</p>\n<p>“What else can that be,” thought the miller, “but a young puppy or</p>\n<p>kitten?” and he promised her what she desired.</p>\n<p>The Nix descended into the water again, and he hurried back to his</p>\n",
        "<p>mill, consoled and in good spirits.</p>\n<p>He had not yet reached it, when the</p>\n<p>maid-servant came out of the house, and cried to him to rejoice, for</p>\n<p>his wife had a little boy.</p>\n<p>The miller stood as if struck by lightning.</p>\n<p>He saw very well that the cunning Nix had been aware of it, and had</p>\n<p>cheated him.</p>\n",
        "<p>Hanging his head, he went up to his wife’s bedside and when she said,</p>\n<p>“Why do you not rejoice over the fine boy?” he told her what had</p>\n<p>befallen him, and what kind of a promise he had given to the Nix.</p>\n<p>“Of</p>\n<p>what use to me are riches and prosperity?” he added, “if I am to lose</p>\n<p>my child; but what can I do?”</p>\n<p>Even the relations, who had come thither to wish them joy, did not</p>\n",
        "<p>know what to say.</p>\n<p>In the meantime prosperity again returned to the</p>\n<p>miller’s house.</p>\n<p>All that he undertook succeeded; it was as if presses</p>\n<p>and coffers filled themselves of their own accord, and as if money</p>\n<p>multiplied nightly in the cupboards.</p>\n<p>It was not long before his wealth</p>\n",
        "<p>was greater than it had ever been before.</p>\n<p>But he could not rejoice over</p>\n<p>it untroubled, the bargain which he had made with the Nix tormented his</p>\n<p>soul.</p>\n<p>Whenever he passed the mill-pond, he feared she might ascend and remind</p>\n<p>him of his debt.</p>\n<p>He never let the boy himself go near the water.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Beware,” he said to him, “if you do but touch the water, a hand will</p>\n<p>rise, seize you, and draw you down.”</p>\n<p>But as year after year went by, and the Nix did not show herself again,</p>\n<p>the miller began to feel at ease.</p>\n<p>The boy grew up to be a youth and</p>\n<p>was apprenticed to a huntsman.</p>\n<p>When he had learnt everything, and had</p>\n",

        "<p>One day, the huntsman was chasing a roe.</p>\n<p>And when the animal turned</p>\n<p>aside from the forest into the open country, he pursued it and at last</p>\n<p>shot it.</p>\n<p>He did not notice that he was now in the neighborhood of the</p>\n<p>dangerous mill-pond, and went, after he had disembowelled the stag, to</p>\n<p>the water, in order to wash his blood-stained hands.</p>\n",

        "<p>his work, he said to his wife, “Let my dinner be brought into the wood</p>\n<p>to me by my eldest daughter, or I shall never get my work done.</p>\n<p>And in</p>\n<p>order that she may not miss her way,” he added, “I will take a bag of</p>\n<p>millet with me and strew the seeds on the path.”</p>\n<p>When, therefore, the sun was just above the centre of the wood, the</p>\n<p>girl set out on her way with a bowl of soup.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the field-sparrows,</p>\n<p>and wood-sparrows, larks and finches, blackbirds and siskins had picked</p>\n<p>up the millet long before, and the girl could not find the track.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>trusting to chance, she went on and on, until the sun sank and night</p>\n<p>began to fall.</p>\n<p>The trees rustled in the darkness, the owls hooted, and</p>\n",
        "<p>she began to be afraid.</p>\n<p>Then in the distance she perceived a light which glimmered between the</p>\n<p>trees.</p>\n<p>“There ought to be some people living there, who can take me in</p>\n<p>for the night,” thought she, and went up to the light.</p>\n<p>It was not long</p>\n<p>before she came to a house the windows of which were all lighted up.</p>\n",
        "<p>She knocked, and a rough voice from the inside cried, “Come in.”</p>\n<p>The girl stepped into the dark entrance, and knocked at the door of the</p>\n<p>room.</p>\n<p>“Just come in,” cried the voice.</p>\n<p>And when she opened the door, an old gray-haired man was sitting at the</p>\n<p>table, supporting his face with both hands, and his white beard fell</p>\n<p>down over the table almost as far as the ground.</p>\n",
        "<p>By the stove lay three</p>\n<p>animals, a hen, a cock, and a brindled cow.</p>\n<p>The girl told her story to the Old Man, and begged for shelter for the</p>\n<p>night.</p>\n<p>The man said:</p>\n<p>“_Pretty little Hen,</p>\n<p>Pretty little Cock,</p>\n",
        "<p>And pretty brindled Cow,</p>\n<p>What say ye all now?_”</p>\n<p>“_Duks,_” answered the animals, and that must have meant, “We are</p>\n<p>willing,” for the Old Man said, “Here you shall have shelter and food.</p>\n<p>Go to the fire, and cook us our supper.”</p>\n<p>The girl found in the kitchen abundance of everything and cooked a good</p>\n<p>supper, but had no thought of the animals.</p>\n",
        "<p>She carried the full dishes</p>\n<p>to the table, seated herself by the gray-haired man, ate and satisfied</p>\n<p>her hunger.</p>\n<p>When she had had enough, she said, “But now I am tired.</p>\n<p>Where is there</p>\n<p>a bed in which I can lie down, and sleep?” The animals replied:</p>\n<p>“_Thou hast eaten with him,</p>\n",
        "<p>Thou hast drunk with him,</p>\n<p>Thou hast had no thought for us,</p>\n<p>So find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night._”</p>\n<p>Then said the Old Man, “Just go up-stairs, and you will find a room</p>\n<p>with two beds.</p>\n<p>Shake them up, and put white linen on them, and then I,</p>\n<p>too, will come and lie down to sleep.”</p>\n",
        "<p>The girl went up, and when she had shaken the beds and put clean sheets</p>\n<p>on, she lay down in one of them without waiting any longer for the Old</p>\n<p>Man.</p>\n<p>After some time, however, the gray-haired man came, took his candle,</p>\n<p>looked at the girl and shook his head.</p>\n<p>When he saw that she had fallen</p>\n<p>into a sound sleep, he opened a trap-door, and let her down into the</p>\n",
        "<p>cellar.</p>\n<p>Late at night, the woodcutter came home, and reproached his wife for</p>\n<p>leaving him to hunger all day.</p>\n<p>“It is not my fault,” she replied, “the</p>\n<p>girl went out with your dinner, and must have lost herself, but she is</p>\n<p>sure to come back to-morrow.”</p>\n<p>The woodcutter, however, arose before dawn to go into the wood, and</p>\n",
        "<p>requested that the second daughter should take him his dinner that day.</p>\n<p>“I will take a bag with lentils,” said he; “the seeds are larger than</p>\n<p>millet.</p>\n<p>The girl will see them better, and can’t lose her way.”</p>\n<p>At dinner-time, therefore, the girl took out the food, but the lentils</p>\n<p>had disappeared.</p>\n<p>The birds of the wood had picked them up as they had</p>\n",
        "<p>done the day before, and had left none.</p>\n<p>The girl wandered about in the wood until night, and then she too</p>\n<p>reached the house of the Old Man, was told to go in, and begged for</p>\n<p>food and a bed.</p>\n<p>The man with the white beard again asked the animals:</p>\n<p>“_Pretty little Hen,_</p>\n<p>_Pretty little Cock,_</p>\n",
        "<p>_And pretty brindled Cow,_</p>\n<p>_What say ye all now?_”</p>\n<p>The animals again replied “_Duks_.” And everything happened just as it</p>\n<p>had happened the day before.</p>\n<p>The girl cooked a good meal, ate and drank</p>\n<p>with the Old Man, and did not concern herself about the animals, and</p>\n<p>when she inquired about her bed, they answered:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Thou hast eaten with him,_</p>\n<p>_Thou hast drunk with him,_</p>\n<p>_Thou hast had, no thought for us,_</p>\n<p>_So find out for thyself where thou canst pass the night._”</p>\n<p>When she was asleep the Old Man came, looked at her, shook his head,</p>\n<p>and let her down into the cellar.</p>\n<p>On the third morning, the woodcutter said to his wife, “Send our</p>\n",
        "<p>youngest child out with my dinner to-day, she has always been good and</p>\n<p>obedient, and will stay in the right path, and not run about after</p>\n<p>every wild bumblebee, as her sisters did.”</p>\n<p>The mother did not want to do it, and said, “Am I to lose my dearest</p>\n<p>child, as well?”</p>\n<p>“Have no fear,” he replied, “the girl will not go astray; she is too</p>\n<p>prudent and sensible.</p>\n",
        "<p>Besides, I will take some peas with me, and strew</p>\n<p>them about.</p>\n<p>They are still larger than lentils, and will show her the</p>\n<p>way.”</p>\n<p>But when the girl went out with her basket on her arm, the wood-pigeons</p>\n<p>had already got all the peas in their crops, and she did not know which</p>\n<p>way to turn.</p>\n",
        "<p>She was full of sorrow and never ceased to think how</p>\n<p>hungry her father would be, and how her good mother would grieve, if</p>\n<p>she did not return home.</p>\n<p>At length, when it grew dark, she saw the light and came to the house</p>\n<p>in the wood.</p>\n<p>She begged quite prettily to be allowed to spend the night</p>\n<p>there.</p>\n",
        "<p>And the man with the white beard once more asked his animals:</p>\n<p>“_Pretty little Hen,</p>\n<p>Pretty little Cock,</p>\n<p>And pretty brindled Cow,</p>\n<p>What say ye all now?_”</p>\n<p>“_Duks_,” said they.</p>\n<p>Then the girl went to the stove where the animals</p>\n",
        "<p>were lying, and petted the cock and hen, and stroked their smooth</p>\n<p>feathers with her hand, and caressed the brindled cow between her horns.</p>\n<p>And when, in obedience to the Old Man’s orders, she had made ready some</p>\n<p>good soup, and the bowl was placed upon the table, she said, “Am I to</p>\n<p>eat as much as I want, and the good animals to have nothing?</p>\n<p>Outside is</p>\n<p>food in plenty, I will look after them first.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So she went and brought some barley and strewed it for the cock and</p>\n<p>hen, and a whole armful of sweet-smelling hay for the cow.</p>\n<p>“I hope you</p>\n<p>will like it, dear Animals,” said she, “and you shall have a refreshing</p>\n<p>draught in case you are thirsty.”</p>\n<p>Then she fetched in a bucketful of water, and the cock and hen jumped</p>\n<p>on to the edge of it and dipped their beaks in.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then held up their</p>\n<p>heads as the birds do when they drink, and the brindled cow also took a</p>\n<p>hearty draught.</p>\n<p>When the animals were fed, the girl seated herself at the table by the</p>\n<p>Old Man, and ate what he had left.</p>\n<p>It was not long before the cock and</p>\n<p>the hen began to thrust their heads beneath their wings, and the eyes</p>\n",
        "<p>of the cow likewise began to blink.</p>\n<p>Then said the girl, “Ought we not</p>\n<p>to go to bed?”</p>\n<p>“_Pretty little Hen,</p>\n<p>Pretty little Cock,</p>\n<p>And pretty brindled Cow,</p>\n<p>What say ye all now?_”</p>\n",
        "<p>The animals answered “_Duks_.”</p>\n<p>“_Thou hast eaten with us,</p>\n<p>Thou hast drunk with us,</p>\n<p>Thou hast had kind thought for all of us,</p>\n<p>We wish thee good-night._”</p>\n<p>Then the girl went up-stairs, shook the feather-beds, and laid clean</p>\n<p>sheets on them.</p>\n",
        "<p>And when she had done it the Old Man came and lay down</p>\n<p>on one of the beds, and his white beard reached down to his feet.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>girl lay down on the other, said her prayers, and fell asleep.</p>\n<p>She slept quietly till midnight, and then there was such a noise in the</p>\n<p>house that she awoke.</p>\n<p>There was a sound of cracking and splitting in</p>\n",
        "<p>every corner.</p>\n<p>The doors sprang open, and beat against the walls.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>beams groaned as if they were being torn out of their joints.</p>\n<p>It seemed</p>\n<p>as if the staircase were falling down.</p>\n<p>And at length there was a crash</p>\n",
        "<p>as if the entire roof had fallen in.</p>\n<p>As, however, all grew quiet once more, and the girl was not hurt, she</p>\n<p>stayed quietly lying where she was, and fell asleep again.</p>\n<p>But when she</p>\n<p>woke up in the morning with the brilliancy of the sunshine, what did</p>\n<p>her eyes behold?</p>\n<p>She was lying in a vast hall, and everything around her shone with</p>\n",
        "<p>royal splendor.</p>\n<p>On the walls, golden flowers grew up on a ground of</p>\n<p>green silk.</p>\n<p>The bed was of ivory, and the canopy of red velvet, and on</p>\n<p>a chair close by, was a pair of shoes embroidered with pearls.</p>\n<p>The girl believed that she was in a dream, but three richly clad</p>\n<p>attendants came in, and asked what orders she would like to give?</p>\n",
        "<p>“If you will go,” she replied, “I will get up at once and make ready</p>\n<p>some soup for the Old Man, and then I will feed the pretty little hen,</p>\n<p>and the cock, and the beautiful brindled cow.”</p>\n<p>She thought the Old Man was up already, and looked round at his bed.</p>\n<p>He, however, was not lying in it, but a stranger.</p>\n<p>And while she was looking at him, and becoming aware that he was young</p>\n<p>and handsome, he awoke, sat up in bed, and said, “I am a King’s Son,</p>\n",
        "<p>and was enchanted by a wicked Witch, and made to live in this wood, as</p>\n<p>an old gray-haired man.</p>\n<p>No one was allowed to be with me but my three</p>\n<p>attendants in the form of a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow.</p>\n<p>The spell</p>\n<p>was not to be broken until a girl came to us, whose heart was so good</p>\n<p>that she showed herself full of love, not only toward mankind, but</p>\n",

        "<p>“I have locked them in the cellar, and to-morrow they shall be led into</p>\n<p>the wood, and shall live as servants to a charcoal-burner, until they</p>\n<p>have grown kinder, and do not leave poor animals to suffer hunger.”</p>\n<p>[Illustration]</p>\n<h3>MAID MALEEN</h3>\n<p>There was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter</p>\n<p>of a mighty King.</p>\n",

        "<p>destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human</p>\n<p>being was visible.</p>\n<p>When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through,</p>\n<p>the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>where were they to go?</p>\n<p>The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven</p>\n",

        "<p>one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the</p>\n<p>kitchen.</p>\n<p>When the day came for the Bride and the Bridegroom to go to church,</p>\n<p>she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself</p>\n<p>in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen you.</p>\n",
        "<p>I</p>\n<p>have sprained my foot, and cannot walk through the streets.</p>\n<p>You shall</p>\n<p>put on my wedding-clothes and take my place.</p>\n<p>A greater honor than that</p>\n<p>you cannot have!”</p>\n<p>Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honor which</p>\n",
        "<p>is not suitable for me.”</p>\n<p>[Illustration: THE PRINCE TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND LED HER TO CHURCH]</p>\n<p>It was in vain, too, that the Bride offered her gold.</p>\n<p>At last she</p>\n<p>said angrily, “If you do not obey me, it shall cost you your life.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>have but to speak the word, and your head will lie at your feet.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then she was forced to obey, and put on the Bride’s magnificent clothes</p>\n<p>and all her jewels.</p>\n<p>When she entered the royal hall, every one was</p>\n<p>amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the</p>\n<p>Bride whom I have chosen for you, and whom you must lead to church.”</p>\n<p>The Bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid</p>\n<p>Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long</p>\n",
        "<p>been shut up in the tower or dead.”</p>\n<p>He took her by the hand and led her to church.</p>\n<p>On the way was a</p>\n<p>nettle-plant, and she said:</p>\n<p>“_Nettle-plant, Nettle-plant,</p>\n<p>Nettle-plant so small!</p>\n<p>What are you doing here,</p>\n",
        "<p>Alone by the wall?</p>\n<p>I have the time known,</p>\n<p>When unroasted, unboiled,</p>\n<p>I ate thee alone!_”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying?” asked the King’s Son.</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”</p>\n<p>He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence.</p>\n",
        "<p>When they</p>\n<p>came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said:</p>\n<p>“_Foot-bridge, break not,</p>\n<p>I am not the true Bride._”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying there?” asked the King’s Son.</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”</p>\n<p>When they came to the church-door, she said once more:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Church-door, break not,</p>\n<p>I am not the true Bride._”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying there?” asked he.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.”</p>\n<p>Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened</p>\n<p>the clasp.</p>\n<p>Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined</p>\n",
        "<p>their hands together before the altar, and married them.</p>\n<p>He led her</p>\n<p>home but she did not speak a single word the whole way.</p>\n<p>When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the Bride’s</p>\n<p>chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed</p>\n<p>herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck,</p>\n<p>which she had received from the Bridegroom.</p>\n",
        "<p>When the night came, and the Bride was to be led into the apartment of</p>\n<p>the King’s Son, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not</p>\n<p>observe the deception.</p>\n<p>As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What did you say</p>\n<p>to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”</p>\n<p>“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”</p>\n<p>“If you did not do it, then you are not the true Bride,” said he.</p>\n",
        "<p>So she bethought herself, and said:</p>\n<p>“_I must go my maid to see,</p>\n<p>Who keeps my secret thoughts for me._”</p>\n<p>She went out and sought Maid Maleen.</p>\n<p>“Girl, what have you been saying</p>\n<p>to the nettle?”</p>\n<p>“I said nothing but:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Nettle-plant, Nettle-plant,</p>\n<p>Nettle-plant so small!</p>\n<p>What are you doing here,</p>\n<p>Alone by the wall?</p>\n<p>I have the time known,</p>\n<p>When unroasted, unboiled,</p>\n<p>I ate thee alone!_”</p>\n",
        "<p>The Bride ran back into the chamber, and said, “I know now what I said</p>\n<p>to the nettle,” and she repeated the words which she had just heard.</p>\n<p>“But what did you say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?” asked</p>\n<p>the King’s Son.</p>\n<p>“To the foot-bridge?” she answered.</p>\n<p>“I don’t talk to foot-bridges.”</p>\n<p>“Then you are not the true Bride.”</p>\n",
        "<p>She again said:</p>\n<p>“_I must go my maid to see,</p>\n<p>Who keeps my secret thoughts for me,_”</p>\n<p>and ran out and found Maid Maleen.</p>\n<p>“Girl, what did you say to the</p>\n<p>foot-bridge?”</p>\n<p>“I said nothing but:</p>\n",
        "<p>“_Foot-bridge, break not,</p>\n<p>I am not the true Bride._”</p>\n<p>“That costs you your life!” cried the Bride, but she hurried into the</p>\n<p>room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she</p>\n<p>repeated the words.</p>\n<p>“But what did you say to the church-door?”</p>\n<p>“To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Then you are not the true Bride.”</p>\n<p>She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what did you say</p>\n<p>to the church-door?”</p>\n<p>“I said nothing but:</p>\n<p>“_Church-door, break not,</p>\n<p>I am not the true Bride._”</p>\n<p>“That will break your neck for you!” cried the Bride, and flew into a</p>\n",
        "<p>terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I</p>\n<p>know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words.</p>\n<p>“But where have you the jewel which I gave you at the church-door?”</p>\n<p>“What jewel?” she answered; “you did not give me any jewel.”</p>\n<p>“I myself put it round your neck, and I myself fastened it.</p>\n<p>If you do</p>\n<p>not know that, you are not the true Bride.”</p>\n",
        "<p>He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her ugliness, he sprang</p>\n<p>back terrified, and said, “How come you here?</p>\n<p>Who are you?”</p>\n<p>“I am your betrothed Bride, but because I feared lest the people should</p>\n<p>mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to</p>\n<p>dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.”</p>\n<p>“Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her</p>\n",
        "<p>here.”</p>\n<p>She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an</p>\n<p>impostor, and that they must take her out into the courtyard and strike</p>\n<p>off her head.</p>\n<p>The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but</p>\n<p>she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s Son heard her voice,</p>\n<p>hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free.</p>\n",
        "<p>Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which</p>\n<p>he had given her at the church-door.</p>\n<p>“You are the true Bride,” said he, “who went with me to church.</p>\n<p>Come</p>\n<p>with me now to my room.”</p>\n<p>When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to the church you did</p>\n<p>name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed Bride.</p>\n",
        "<p>If I could believe it</p>\n<p>possible, I should think she was standing before me--you are like her</p>\n<p>in every respect.”</p>\n<p>She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for your sake was imprisoned seven</p>\n<p>years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived</p>\n<p>so long in want and poverty.</p>\n<p>To-day, however, the sun is shining on me</p>\n",
        "<p>once more.</p>\n<p>I was married to you in the church, and I am your lawful</p>\n<p>wife.”</p>\n<p>Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives.</p>\n<p>The false Bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head</p>\n<p>cut off.</p>\n<p>The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing</p>\n",
        "<p>for a long time, and when the children passed by it, they sang:</p>\n<p>“_Kling, klang, gloria.</p>\n<p>Who sits within this tower?</p>\n<p>A King’s Daughter, she sits within,</p>\n<p>A sight of her I cannot win,</p>\n<p>The wall it will not break,</p>\n<p>The stone cannot be pierced.</p>\n",
