        "<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>\n<h3>MRS.</h3>\n<h3>REDWING'S SPECKLED EGG</h3>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind came down from the Purple Hills in the golden light</p>\n<p>of the early morning.</p>\n<p>Over her shoulders was slung a bag--a great big</p>\n<p>bag--and in the bag were all of Old Mother West Wind's children, the</p>\n",
        "<p>Merry Little Breezes.</p>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind came down from the Purple Hills to the Green</p>\n<p>Meadows and as she walked she crooned a song:</p>\n<p>“Ships upon the ocean wait;</p>\n<h3>I must hurry, hurry on!</h3>\n<p>Mills are idle if I'm late;</p>\n<h3>I must hurry, hurry on.”</h3>\n",
        "<p>When she reached the Green Meadows Old Mother West Wind opened her bag,</p>\n<p>turned it upside down and shook it.</p>\n<p>Out tumbled all the Merry Little</p>\n<p>Breezes and began to spin round and round for very joy, for you see they</p>\n<p>were to lay in the Green Meadows all day long until Old Mother West Wind</p>\n<p>should come back at night and take them all to their home behind the</p>\n<p>Purple Hills.</p>\n",
        "<p>First they raced over to see Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>They found Johnny Chuck</p>\n<p>sitting just outside his door eating his breakfast.</p>\n<p>One, for very</p>\n<p>mischief, snatched right out of Johnny Chuck's mouth the green leaf of</p>\n<p>corn he was eating, and ran away with it.</p>\n<p>Another playfully pulled his</p>\n",
        "<p>whiskers, while a third rumpled up his hair.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck pretended to be very cross indeed, but really he didn't</p>\n<p>mind a bit, for Johnny Chuck loved the Merry Little Breezes and played</p>\n<p>with them everyday.</p>\n<p>And if they teased Johnny Chuck they were good to him, too.</p>\n<p>When they</p>\n<p>saw Farmer Brown coming across the Green Meadows with a gun one of them</p>\n",
        "<p>would dance over to Johnny Chuck and whisper to him that Farmer Brown</p>\n<p>was coming, and then Johnny Chuck would hide away, deep down in his snug</p>\n<p>little house under ground, and Farmer Brown would wonder and wonder why</p>\n<p>it was that he never, never could get near enough to shoot Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>But he never, never could.</p>\n<p>When the Merry Little Breezes left Johnny Chuck they raced across the</p>\n<p>Green Meadows to the Smiling Pool to say good morning to Grandfather</p>\n",
        "<p>Frog who sat on a big lily pad watching for green flies for breakfast.</p>\n<p>“Chug-arum,” said Grandfather Frog, which was his way of saying good</p>\n<p>morning.</p>\n<p>Just then along came a fat green fly and up jumped Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>When he sat down again on the lily pad the fat green fly was nowhere to</p>\n<p>be seen, but Grandfather Frog looked very well satisfied indeed as he</p>\n<p>contentedly rubbed his white waistcoat with one hand.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What is the news, Grandfather Frog?” cried the Merry Little Breezes.</p>\n<p>“Mrs.</p>\n<p>Redwing has a new speckled egg in her nest in the bulrushes,” said</p>\n<p>Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>“We must see it,” cried the Merry Little Breezes, and away they all ran</p>\n<p>to the swamp where the bulrushes grow.</p>\n<p>Now someone else had heard of Mrs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Redwing's dear little nest in the</p>\n<p>bulrushes, and he had started out bright and early that morning to</p>\n<p>try and find it, for he wanted to steal the little speckled eggs just</p>\n<p>because they were pretty.</p>\n<p>It was Tommy Brown, the farmer's boy.</p>\n<p>When the Merry Little Breezes reached the swamp where the bulrushes</p>\n<p>grow they found poor Mrs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Redwing in great distress.</p>\n<p>She was afraid that</p>\n<p>Tommy Brown would find her dear little nest, for he was very, very near</p>\n<p>it, and his eyes were very, very sharp.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” cried the Merry Little Breezes, “we must help Mrs.</p>\n<p>Redwing save</p>\n<p>her pretty speckled eggs from bad Tommy Brown!”</p>\n",
        "<p>So one of the Merry Little Breezes whisked Tommy Brown's old straw hat</p>\n<p>off his head over into the Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>Of course Tommy ran after it.</p>\n<p>Just as he stooped to pick it up another little Breeze ran away with</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<p>Then they took turns, first one little Breeze, then another little</p>\n<p>Breeze running away with the old straw hat just as Tommy Brown would</p>\n",
        "<p>almost get his hands on it.</p>\n<p>Down past the Smiling Pool and across the</p>\n<p>Laughing Brook they raced and chased the old straw hat, Tommy Brown</p>\n<p>running after it, very cross, very red in the face, and breathing very</p>\n<p>hard.</p>\n<p>Way across the Green Meadows they ran to the edge of the wood,</p>\n<p>where they hung the old straw hat in the middle of a thorn tree.</p>\n",
        "<p>By the</p>\n<p>time Tommy Brown had it once more on his head he had forgotten all about</p>\n<p>Mrs.</p>\n<p>Redwing and her dear little nest.</p>\n<p>Besides, he heard the breakfast</p>\n<p>horn blowing just then, so off he started for home up the Lone Little</p>\n<p>Path through the wood.</p>\n",
        "<p>And all the Merry Little Breezes danced away across the Green Meadows</p>\n<p>to the swamp where the bulrushes grow to see the new speckled egg in the</p>\n<p>dear little nest where Mrs.</p>\n<p>Redwing was singing for joy.</p>\n<p>And while she</p>\n<p>sang the Merry Little Breezes danced among the bulrushes, for they knew,</p>\n<p>and Mrs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Redwing knew, that some day out of that pretty new speckled egg</p>\n<p>would come a wee baby Redwing.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER II WHY GRANDFATHER FROG HAS NO TAIL</h3>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind had gone to her day's work, leaving all the Merry</p>\n<p>Little Breezes to play in the Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>They had played tag and run</p>\n<p>races with the Bees and played hide and seek with the Sun Beams, and now</p>\n",
        "<p>they had gathered around the Smiling Pool where on a green lily pad sat</p>\n<p>Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>Grandfather Frog was old, very old, indeed, and very, very wise.</p>\n<p>He wore</p>\n<p>a green coat and his voice was very deep.</p>\n<p>When Grandfather Frog</p>\n<p>spoke everybody listened very respectfully.</p>\n",
        "<p>Even Billy Mink treated</p>\n<p>Grandfather Frog with respect, for Billy Mink's father and his father's</p>\n<p>father could not remember when Grandfather Frog had not sat on the lily</p>\n<p>pad watching for green flies.</p>\n<p>Down in the Smiling Pool were some of Grandfather Frog's</p>\n<p>great-great-great-great-great grandchildren.</p>\n<p>You wouldn't have known</p>\n",
        "<p>that they were his grandchildren unless some one told you.</p>\n<p>They didn't</p>\n<p>look the least bit like Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>They were round and fat and</p>\n<p>had long tails and perhaps this is why they were called Pollywogs.</p>\n<p>“Oh Grandfather Frog, tell us why you don't have a tail as you did when</p>\n<p>you were young,” begged one of the Merry Little Breezes.</p>\n",
        "<p>Grandfather Frog snapped up a foolish green fly and settled himself on</p>\n<p>his big lily pad, while all the Merry Little Breezes gathered round to</p>\n<p>listen.</p>\n<p>“Once on a time,” began Grandfather Frog, “the Frogs ruled the world,</p>\n<p>which was mostly water.</p>\n<p>There was very little dry land--oh, very little</p>\n<p>indeed!</p>\n",
        "<p>There were no boys to throw stones and no hungry Mink to gobble</p>\n<p>up foolish Frog-babies who were taking a sun bath!”</p>\n<p>Billy Mink, who had joined the Merry Little Breezes and was listening,</p>\n<p>squirmed uneasily and looked away guiltily.</p>\n<p>“In those days all the Frogs had tails, long handsome tails of which</p>\n<p>they were very, very proud indeed,” continued Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>“The</p>\n",
        "<p>King of all the Frogs was twice as big as any other Frog, and his tail</p>\n<p>was three times as long.</p>\n<p>He was very proud, oh, very proud indeed of</p>\n<p>his long tail.</p>\n<p>He used to sit and admire it until he thought that there</p>\n<p>never had been and never could be another such tail.</p>\n<p>He used to wave it</p>\n",
        "<p>back and forth in the water, and every time he waved it all the other</p>\n<p>Frogs would cry 'Ah!' and 'Oh!' Every day the King grew more vain.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<h3>did nothing at all but eat and sleep and admire his tail.</h3>\n<p>“Now all the other Frogs did just as the King did, so pretty soon none</p>\n<p>of the Frogs were doing anything but sitting about eating, sleeping and</p>\n<p>admiring their own tails and the King's.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Now you all know that people who do nothing worth while in this world</p>\n<p>are of no use and there is little room for them.</p>\n<p>So when Mother Nature</p>\n<p>saw how useless had become the Frog tribe she called the King Frog</p>\n<p>before her and she said:</p>\n<p>“'Because you can think of nothing but your beautiful tail it shall be</p>\n<p>taken away from you.</p>\n",
        "<p>Because you do nothing but eat and sleep your mouth</p>\n<p>shall become wide like a door, and your eyes shall start forth from your</p>\n<p>head.</p>\n<p>You shall become bow-legged and ugly to look at, and all the world</p>\n<p>shall laugh at you.'</p>\n<p>“The King Frog looked at his beautiful tail and already it seemed to</p>\n<p>have grown shorter.</p>\n",
        "<p>He looked again and it was shorter still.</p>\n<p>Every</p>\n<p>time he looked his tail had grown shorter and smaller.</p>\n<p>By and by when he</p>\n<p>looked there was nothing left but a little stub which he couldn't even</p>\n<p>wriggle.</p>\n<p>Then even that disappeared, his eyes popped out of his head and</p>\n",
        "<p>his mouth grew bigger and bigger.”</p>\n<p>Old Grandfather Frog stopped and looked sadly at a foolish green fly</p>\n<p>coming his way.</p>\n<p>“Chug-arum,” said Grandfather Frog, opening his mouth</p>\n<p>very wide and hopping up in the air.</p>\n<p>When he sat down again on his big</p>\n<p>lily pad the green fly was nowhere to be seen.</p>\n",
        "<p>Grandfather Frog smacked</p>\n<p>his lips and continued:</p>\n<p>“And from that day to this every Frog has started life with a big tail,</p>\n<p>and as he has grown bigger and bigger his tail has grown smaller and</p>\n<p>smaller, until finally it disappears, and then he remembers how foolish</p>\n<p>and useless it is to be vain of what nature has given us.</p>\n<p>And that is</p>\n",
        "<p>how I came to lose my tail,” finished Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” shouted all the Merry Little Breezes.</p>\n<p>“We won't forget.”</p>\n<p>Then they ran a race to see who could reach Johnny Chuck's home first</p>\n<p>and tell him that Farmer Brown was coming down on the Green Meadows with</p>\n<p>a gun.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER III HOW REDDY FOX WAS SURPRISED</h3>\n",
        "<p>Johnny Chuck and Reddy Fox lived very near together on the edge of the</p>\n<p>Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck was fat and roly-poly.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox was slim</p>\n<p>and wore a bright red coat.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox used to like to frighten Johnny</p>\n<p>Chuck by suddenly popping out from behind a tree and making believe that</p>\n",
        "<p>he was going to eat Johnny Chuck all up.</p>\n<p>One bright summer day Johnny Chuck was out looking for a good breakfast</p>\n<p>of nice tender clover.</p>\n<p>He had wandered quite a long way from his snug</p>\n<p>little house in the long meadow grass, although his mother had told him</p>\n<p>never to go out of sight of the door.</p>\n<p>But Johnny was like some little</p>\n",
        "<p>boys I know, and forgot all he had been told.</p>\n<p>He walked and walked and walked.</p>\n<p>Every few minutes Johnny Chuck saw</p>\n<p>something farther on that looked like a patch of nice fresh clover.</p>\n<p>And every time when he reached it Johnny Chuck found that he had made a</p>\n<p>mistake.</p>\n<p>So Johnny Chuck walked and walked and walked.</p>\n",
        "<p>Old Mother West Wind, coming across the Green Meadows, saw Johnny Chuck</p>\n<p>and asked him where he was going.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck pretended not to hear and</p>\n<p>just walked faster.</p>\n<p>One of the Merry Little Breezes danced along in front of him.</p>\n<p>“Look out, Johnny Chuck, you will get lost,” cried the Merry Little</p>\n<p>Breeze then pulled Johnny's whiskers and ran away.</p>\n",
        "<p>Higher and higher up in the sky climbed round, red Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun.</p>\n<p>Every time</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck looked up at him Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun winked.</p>\n<p>“So long as I can see great round, red Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun and he winks at me I</p>\n",
        "<p>can't be lost,” thought Johnny Chuck, and trotted on looking for clover.</p>\n<p>By and by Johnny Chuck really did find some clover--just the sweetest</p>\n<p>clover that grew in the Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck ate and ate and ate</p>\n<p>and then what do you think he did?</p>\n<p>Why, he curled right up in the nice</p>\n<p>sweet clover and went fast asleep.</p>\n",
        "<p>Great round, red Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun kept climbing higher and higher up in the sky,</p>\n<p>then by and by he began to go down on the other side, and long shadows</p>\n<p>began to creep out across the Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck didn't know</p>\n<p>anything about them: he was fast asleep.</p>\n<p>By and by one of the Merry Little Breezes found Johnny Chuck all curled</p>\n",
        "<p>up in a funny round ball.</p>\n<p>“Wake up Johnny Chuck!</p>\n<p>Wake up!” shouted the Merry Little Breeze.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck opened his eyes.</p>\n<p>Then he sat up and rubbed them.</p>\n<p>For just a</p>\n<p>few, few minutes he couldn't remember where he was at all.</p>\n",
        "<p>By and by he sat up very straight to look over the grass and see where</p>\n<p>he was.</p>\n<p>But he was so far from home that he didn't see a single thing</p>\n<p>that looked at all like the things he was used to.</p>\n<p>The trees were all</p>\n<p>different.</p>\n<p>The bushes were all different.</p>\n",
        "<p>Everything was different.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck was lost.</p>\n<p>Now, when Johnny sat up, Reddy Fox happened to be looking over the Green</p>\n<p>Meadows and he saw Johnny's head where it popped above the grass.</p>\n<p>“Aha!” said Reddy Fox, “I'll scare Johnny Chuck so he'll wish he'd never</p>\n<p>put his nose out of his house.”</p>\n<p>Then Reddy dropped down behind the long grass and crept softly, oh,</p>\n",
        "<p>ever so softly, through the paths of his own, until he was right behind</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck had been so intent looking for home that he</p>\n<p>didn't see anything else.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox stole right up behind Johnny and pulled Johnny's little short</p>\n<p>tail hard.</p>\n<p>How it did frighten Johnny Chuck!</p>\n",
        "<p>He jumped right straight</p>\n<p>up in the air and when he came down he was the maddest little woodchuck</p>\n<p>that ever lived in the Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox had thought that Johnny would run, and then Reddy meant to run</p>\n<p>after him and pull his tail and tease him all the way home.</p>\n<p>Now, Reddy</p>\n<p>Fox got as big a surprise as Johnny had had when Reddy pulled his tail.</p>\n",
        "<p>Johnny didn't stop to think that Reddy Fox was twice as big as he,</p>\n<p>but with his eyes snapping, and chattering as only a little Chuck can</p>\n<p>chatter, with every little hair on his little body standing right up</p>\n<p>on end, so that he seemed twice as big as he really was, he started for</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>It surprised Reddy Fox so that he didn't know what to do, and he simply</p>\n<p>ran.</p>\n",
        "<p>Johnny Chuck ran after him, nipping Reddy's heels every minute or</p>\n<p>two.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit just happened to be down that way.</p>\n<p>He was sitting up</p>\n<p>very straight looking to see what mischief he could get into when he</p>\n<p>caught sight of Reddy Fox running as hard as ever he could.</p>\n<p>“It must</p>\n",
        "<p>be that Bowser, the hound, is after Reddy Fox,” said Peter Rabbit to</p>\n<p>himself.</p>\n<p>“I must watch out that he doesn't find me.”</p>\n<p>Just then he caught sight of Johnny Chuck with every little hair</p>\n<p>standing up on end and running after Reddy Fox as fast as his short legs</p>\n<p>could go.</p>\n<p>“Ho!</p>\n",
        "<p>ho!</p>\n<p>ho!” shouted Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“Reddy Fox afraid of Johnny Chuck!</p>\n<p>Ho!</p>\n<p>ho!</p>\n<p>Ho!”</p>\n<p>Then Peter Rabbit scampered away to find Jimmy Skunk and Bobby Coon and</p>\n",
        "<p>Happy Jack Squirrel to tell them all about how Reddy Fox had run away</p>\n<p>from Johnny Chuck, for you see they were all a little afraid of Reddy</p>\n<p>Fox.</p>\n<p>Straight home ran Reddy Fox as fast as he could go, and going home he</p>\n<p>passed the house of Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>Now Johnny couldn't run so fast as</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox and he was puffing and blowing as only a fat little woodchuck</p>\n",
        "<p>can puff and blow when he has to run hard.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he had lost his ill</p>\n<p>temper now and he thought it was the best joke ever to think that he had</p>\n<p>actually frightened Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>When he came to his own house he stopped</p>\n<p>and sat on his hind legs once more.</p>\n<p>Then he shrilled out after Reddy</p>\n",
        "<p>Fox: “Reddy Fox is a 'fraid cat, 'fraid-cat!</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox is a 'fraid-cat!”</p>\n<p>And all the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind, who were</p>\n<p>playing on the Green Meadows shouted: “Reddy Fox is a 'fraid-cat,</p>\n<p>'fraid-cat!”</p>\n<p>And this is the way that Reddy Fox was surprised and that Johnny Chuck</p>\n<p>found his way home.</p>\n",
        "<h3>CHAPTER IV WHY JIMMY SKUNK WEARS STRIPES</h3>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk, as everybody knows, wears a striped suit, a suit of black</p>\n<p>and white.</p>\n<p>There was a time, long, long ago, when all the Skunk family</p>\n<p>wore black.</p>\n<p>Very handsome their coats were, too, a beautiful, glossy</p>\n<p>black.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were very, very proud of them and took the greatest care of</p>\n<p>them, brushing them carefully ever so many times a day.</p>\n<p>There was a Jimmy Skunk then, just as there is now, and he was head of</p>\n<p>all the Skunk family.</p>\n<p>Now this Jimmy Skunk was very proud and thought</p>\n<p>himself very much of a gentleman.</p>\n<p>He was very independent and cared for</p>\n",
        "<p>no one.</p>\n<p>Like a great many other independent people, he did not always</p>\n<p>consider the rights of others.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it was hinted in the wood and on</p>\n<p>the Green Meadows that not all of Jimmy Skunk's doings would bear the</p>\n<p>light of day.</p>\n<p>It was openly said that he was altogether too fond of</p>\n",
        "<p>prowling about at night, but no one could prove that he was responsible</p>\n<p>for mischief done in the night, for no one saw him.</p>\n<p>You see his coat was</p>\n<p>so black that in the darkness of the night it was not visible at all.</p>\n<p>Now about this time of which I am telling you Mrs.</p>\n<p>Ruffed Grouse made a</p>\n<p>nest at the foot of the Great Pine and in it she laid fifteen beautiful</p>\n",
        "<p>buff eggs.</p>\n<p>Mrs.</p>\n<p>Grouse was very happy, very happy indeed, and all the</p>\n<p>little meadow folks who knew of her happiness were happy too, for they</p>\n<p>all loved shy, demure, little Mrs.</p>\n<p>Grouse.</p>\n<p>Every morning when Peter</p>\n",
        "<p>Rabbit trotted down the Lone Little Path through the wood past the Great</p>\n<p>Pine he would stop for a few minutes to chat with Mrs.</p>\n<p>Grouse.</p>\n<p>Happy</p>\n<p>Jack Squirrel would bring her the news every afternoon.</p>\n<p>The Merry Little</p>\n<p>Breezes of Old Mother West Wind would run up a dozen times a day to see</p>\n",
        "<p>how she was getting along.</p>\n<p>One morning Peter Rabbit, coming down the Lone Little Path for his usual</p>\n<p>morning call, found a terrible state of affairs.</p>\n<p>Poor little Mrs.</p>\n<p>Grouse</p>\n<p>was heart-broken.</p>\n<p>All about the foot of the Great Pine lay the empty</p>\n",
        "<p>shells of her beautiful eggs.</p>\n<p>They had been broken and scattered this</p>\n<p>way and that.</p>\n<p>“How did it happen?” asked Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“I don't know,” sobbed poor little Mrs.</p>\n<p>Grouse.</p>\n<p>“In the night when I was</p>\n",
        "<p>fast asleep something pounced upon me.</p>\n<h3>I managed to get away and fly up</h3>\n<p>in the top of the Great Pine.</p>\n<p>In the morning I found all my eggs broken,</p>\n<p>just as you see them here.”</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit looked the ground over very carefully.</p>\n<p>He hunted around</p>\n",
        "<p>behind the Great Pine, he looked under the bushes, he studied the ground</p>\n<p>with a very wise air.</p>\n<p>Then he hopped off down the Lone Little Path to</p>\n<p>the Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>He stopped at the house of Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>“What makes your eyes so big and round?” asked Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit came very close so as to whisper in Johnny Chuck's ear,</p>\n",
        "<p>and told him all that he had seen.</p>\n<p>Together they went to Jimmy Skunk's</p>\n<p>house.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk was in bed.</p>\n<p>He was very sleepy and very cross when he</p>\n<p>came to the door.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit told him what he had seen.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Too bad!</p>\n<p>Too bad!” said Jimmy Skunk, and yawned sleepily.</p>\n<p>“Won't you join us in trying to find out who did it?” asked Johnny</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk said he would be delighted to come but that he had</p>\n<p>some other business that morning and that he would join them in the</p>\n<p>afternoon.</p>\n",

        "<p>Reddy felt very much pleased with himself that sunny</p>\n<p>morning.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon he saw Johnny Chuck sitting up very straight close</p>\n<p>by the little house where he lives.</p>\n<p>“Johnny Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!</p>\n<p>Johnny</p>\n",
        "<p>Woodchuck!” called Reddy fox.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck pretended not to hear.</p>\n<p>His mother had told him not to play</p>\n<p>with Reddy Fox, for Reddy Fox was a bad boy.</p>\n<p>“Johnny Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!</p>\n<p>Johnny Woodchuck!” called Reddy again.</p>\n<p>This time Johnny turned and looked.</p>\n",
        "<p>He could see Reddy Fox turning</p>\n<p>somersaults and chasing his tail and rolling over and over in the little</p>\n<p>path.</p>\n<p>“Come on!” said Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>“Let's go fishing!”</p>\n<p>“Can't,” said Johnny Chuck, because you know, his mother had told him</p>\n<p>not to play with Reddy Fox.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I'll show you how to catch a fish,” said Reddy Fox, and tried to jump</p>\n<p>over his own shadow.</p>\n<p>“Can't,” said good little Johnny Chuck again, and turned away so that he</p>\n<p>couldn't see Reddy Fox chasing Butterflies and playing catch with Field</p>\n<p>Mice children.</p>\n<p>So Reddy Fox went down to the Laughing Brook all alone.</p>\n<p>The Brook was</p>\n",
        "<p>laughing and singing on its way to join the Big River.</p>\n<p>The sky was blue</p>\n<p>and the sun was bright.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox jumped on the Big Rock in the middle</p>\n<p>of the Laughing Brook and peeped over the other side.</p>\n<p>What do you think</p>\n<p>he saw?</p>\n",
        "<p>Why, right down below in a Dear Little Pool were Mr.</p>\n<p>And Mrs.</p>\n<p>Trout and all the little Trouts.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox wanted some of those little Trouts to take home for his</p>\n<p>dinner, but he didn't know how to catch them.</p>\n<p>He lay flat down on the</p>\n<p>Big Rock and reached way down into the Dear Little Pool, but all the</p>\n",
        "<p>little Trouts laughed at Reddy Fox and not one came within reach.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Trout swam up so quickly that Reddy Fox didn't see him coming and</p>\n<p>bit Reddy's little black paw hard.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” cried Reddy Fox, pulling his little black paw out of the water.</p>\n<p>And all the little Trouts laughed at Reddy Fox.</p>\n",
        "<p>Just then along came Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Reddy Fox!” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>\n<p>“I'm trying to catch a fish,” said Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>“Pooh!</p>\n<p>That's easy!” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“I'll show you how.”</p>\n",

        "<p>peeping over into the Dear Little Pool.</p>\n<p>When Billy Mink saw all those little Trouts playing in the Dear Little</p>\n<p>Pool he laughed.</p>\n<p>“You count three, Reddy Fox,” said he, “and I'll show</p>\n<p>you how to catch a fish.”</p>\n<p>“One!” said Reddy Fox, “Two!</p>\n<p>Three!”</p>\n",
        "<p>Splash!</p>\n<p>Billy Mink had dived head first into the Dear Little Pool.</p>\n<p>He</p>\n<p>spattered water way up onto Reddy Fox, and he frightened old Mr.</p>\n<p>Frog</p>\n<p>so that he fell over backwards off the lily pad where he was taking a</p>\n<p>morning nap right into the water.</p>\n",
        "<p>In a minute Billy Mink climbed out on</p>\n<p>the other side of the Dear Little Pool and sure enough, he had caught</p>\n<p>one of the little Trouts.</p>\n<p>“Give it to me,” cried Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>“Catch one yourself,” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“Old Grandpa Mink wants a fish</p>\n<p>for his dinner, so I am going to take this home.</p>\n",
        "<p>You're afraid, Reddy</p>\n<p>Fox!</p>\n<p>'Fraid-cat!</p>\n<p>Fraid-cat!”</p>\n<p>Billy Mink shook the water off of his little brown coat, picked up the</p>\n<p>little Trout and ran off home.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox lay down again on the Big Rock and peeped into the Dear Little</p>\n",

        "<p>Then Jimmy Skunk stepped right over old Mr.</p>\n<p>Toad, and went on up the</p>\n<p>Crooked Little Path to look for some beetles.</p>\n<p>By and by he came to an old stump of a tree which was hollow and had the</p>\n<p>nicest little round hole in one side.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk took hold of one edge</p>\n<p>with his two little black paws and pulled and pulled.</p>\n",
        "<p>All of a sudden</p>\n<p>the whole side of the old stump tore open and Jimmy Skunk fell flat on</p>\n<p>his back.</p>\n<p>When Jimmy Skunk had rolled over onto his feet again there was Striped</p>\n<p>Chipmunk hopping up and down right in the middle of the path, he was so</p>\n<p>angry.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Striped Chipmunk,” said Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Have you seen any</p>\n<p>beetles?”</p>\n<p>But Striped Chipmunk hopped faster than ever and he said: “What do you</p>\n<p>mean, Jimmy Skunk, by pulling the side off my house?”</p>\n<p>“Is that the side of your house?” asked Jimmy Skunk, politely.</p>\n<p>“I won't</p>\n<p>do it again.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Then Jimmy Skunk stepped right over Striped Chipmunk, and went on up the</p>\n<p>Crooked Little Path to look for some beetles.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon he met Peter Rabbit hopping along down the Crooked Little</p>\n<p>Path.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Jimmy Skunk, where are you going so early in the</p>\n<p>morning?” said Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Peter Rabbit.</p>\n",
        "<p>Have you seen any beetles?” asked Jimmy</p>\n<p>Skunk, politely.</p>\n<p>“No, I haven't seen any beetles, but I'll help you find some,” said</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>So he turned about and hopped ahead of Jimmy Skunk up the</p>\n<p>Crooked Little Path.</p>\n<p>Now because Peter Rabbit's legs are long and he is always in a hurry,</p>\n",
        "<p>he got to the top of the hill first.</p>\n<p>When Jimmy Skunk reached the end</p>\n<p>of the Crooked Little Path on the top of the hill he found Peter Rabbit</p>\n<p>sitting up very straight and looking and looking very hard at a great</p>\n<p>flat stone.</p>\n<p>“What are you looking at, Peter Rabbit?” asked Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>“Sh-h-h!” said Peter Rabbit, “I think there are some beetles under that</p>\n",

        "<p>“Three!”</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk grabbed the black string and pulled as hard as ever he could</p>\n<p>and out came--Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake!</p>\n<p>The string Jimmy Skunk had pulled was Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake's tail, and Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake was very, very angry indeed.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ha!</p>\n<p>Ha!</p>\n<p>Ha!” laughed Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“What do you mean, Jimmy Skunk,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake, “by pulling my</p>\n<p>tail?”</p>\n<p>“Was that your tail?” said Jimmy Skunk, politely.</p>\n",
        "<p>“I won't do it again.</p>\n<p>Have you seen any beetles?”</p>\n<p>But Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake hadn't seen any beetles, and he was so cross that</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk went on over the hill to look for some beetles.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit was still laughing and laughing and laughing.</p>\n<p>And the more</p>\n",
        "<p>he laughed the angrier grew Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake, till finally he started</p>\n<p>after Peter Rabbit to teach him a lesson.</p>\n<p>Then Peter Rabbit stopped laughing, for Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake can run very</p>\n<p>fast.</p>\n<p>Away went Peter Rabbit down the Crooked Little Path as fast as he</p>\n",
        "<p>could go, and away went Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake after him.</p>\n<p>But Jimmy Skunk didn't even look once to see if Mr.</p>\n<p>Black Snake had</p>\n<p>caught Peter Rabbit to teach him a lesson, for Jimmy Skunk had found</p>\n<p>some beetles and was eating his breakfast.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER VIII BILLY MINK'S SWIMMING PARTY</h3>\n",
        "<p>Billy Mink was coming down the bank of the Laughing Brook.</p>\n<p>Billy Mink</p>\n<p>was feeling very good indeed.</p>\n<p>He had had a good breakfast, the sun was</p>\n<p>warm, little white cloud ships were sailing across the blue sky and</p>\n<p>their shadows were sailing across the Green Meadows, the birds were</p>\n<p>singing and the bees were humming.</p>\n",
        "<p>Billy Mink felt like singing too, but</p>\n<p>Billy Mink's voice was not meant for singing.</p>\n<p>By and by Billy Mink came to the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>Here the Laughing Brook</p>\n<p>stopped and rested on its way to join the Big River.</p>\n<p>It stopped its</p>\n<p>noisy laughing and singing and just lay smiling and smiling in the warm</p>\n",
        "<p>sunshine.</p>\n<p>The little flowers on the bank leaned over and nodded to it.</p>\n<p>The beech tree, which was very old, sometimes dropped a leaf into it.</p>\n<p>The cat-tails kept their feet cool in the edge of it.</p>\n<p>Billy Mink jumped out on the Big Rock and looked down into the Smiling</p>\n<p>Pool.</p>\n<p>Over on a green lily pad he saw old Grandfather Frog.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Hello, Grandfather Frog,” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Billy Mink,” said Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>“What mischief are you up to</p>\n<p>this fine sunny morning?”</p>\n<p>Just then Billy Mink saw a little brown head swimming along one edge of</p>\n<p>the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Jerry Muskrat!” shouted Billy Mink.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Hello your own self, Billy Mink,” shouted Jerry Muskrat, “Come in and</p>\n<p>have a swim; the water's fine!”</p>\n<p>“Good,” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“We'll have a swimming party.”</p>\n<p>So Billy Mink called all the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West</p>\n<p>Wind, who were playing with the flowers on the bank, and sent them to</p>\n<p>find Little Joe Otter and invite him to come to the swimming party.</p>\n",
        "<p>Pretty soon back came the Little Breezes and with them came Little Joe</p>\n<p>Otter.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Billy Mink,” said Little Joe Otter.</p>\n<p>“Here I am!”</p>\n<p>“Hello, Little Joe Otter,” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“Come up here on the Big</p>\n<p>Rock and see who can dive the deepest into the Smiling Pool.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat climbed up on the Big Rock side of</p>\n<p>Billy Mink and they all stood side by side in their little brown bathing</p>\n<p>suits looking down into the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>“Now when I count three we'll all dive into the Smiling Pool together</p>\n<p>and see who can dive the deepest.</p>\n<p>One!” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“Two!” said</p>\n",
        "<p>Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“Three!” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>And when he said “Three!” in they all went head first.</p>\n<p>My such a splash</p>\n<p>as they did make!</p>\n<p>They upset old Grandfather Frog so that he fell off</p>\n<p>his lily pad.</p>\n",
        "<p>They frightened Mr.</p>\n<p>and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Trout so that they jumped</p>\n<p>right out of the water.</p>\n<p>Tiny Tadpole had such a scare that he hid way,</p>\n<p>way down in the mud with only the tip of his funny little nose sticking</p>\n<p>out.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Chug-a-rum,” said old Grandfather Frog, climbing out of his lily pad.</p>\n<p>“If I wasn't so old I would show you how to dive.”</p>\n<p>“Come on, Grandfather Frog!” cried Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“Show us how to dive.”</p>\n<p>And what do you think?</p>\n<p>Why, old Grandfather Frog actually got so excited</p>\n<p>that he climbed up on the Big Rock to show them how to dive.</p>\n",
        "<p>Splash!</p>\n<p>Went Grandfather Frog into the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>Splash!</p>\n<p>Went Billy Mink</p>\n<p>right behind him.</p>\n<p>Splash!</p>\n<p>Splash!</p>\n",
        "<p>Went Little Joe Otter and Jerry</p>\n<p>Muskrat, right at Billy Mink's heels.</p>\n<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Mr.</p>\n<p>Kingfisher, sitting on a branch of the old beech</p>\n<p>tree.</p>\n<p>And then just to show them that he could dive, too, splash!</p>\n<p>He</p>\n",
        "<p>went into the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>Such a noise as they did make!</p>\n<p>All the Little Breezes of Old Mother West</p>\n<p>Wind danced for joy on the bank.</p>\n<p>Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay flew over</p>\n<p>to see what was going on.</p>\n<p>“Now let's see who can swim the farthest under water,” cried Billy Mink.</p>\n",
        "<p>So they all stood side by side on one edge of the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>“Go!” shouted Mr.</p>\n<p>Kingfisher, and in they all plunged.</p>\n<p>Little ripples</p>\n<p>ran across the Smiling Pool and then the water became as smooth and</p>\n<p>smiling as if nothing had gone into it with a plunge.</p>\n<p>Now old Grandfather Frog began to realize that he wasn't as young as he</p>\n",
        "<p>used to be, and he couldn't swim as fast as the others anyway.</p>\n<p>He began</p>\n<p>to get short of breath, so he swam up to the top and stuck just the tip</p>\n<p>of his nose out to get some more air.</p>\n<p>Sammy Jay's sharp eyes saw him.</p>\n<p>“There's Grandfather Frog!” he shouted.</p>\n<p>So then Grandfather Frog popped his head out and swam over to his green</p>\n",
        "<p>lily pad to rest.</p>\n<p>Way over beyond the Big Rock little bubbles in three long rows kept</p>\n<p>coming up to the top of the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>They showed just where Billy</p>\n<p>Mink, Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat were swimming way down out</p>\n<p>of sight.</p>\n<p>It was the air from their lungs making the bubbles.</p>\n",
        "<p>Straight</p>\n<p>across the Smiling Pool went the lines of little bubbles and then way</p>\n<p>out on the farther side two little heads bobbed out of water close</p>\n<p>together.</p>\n<p>They were Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter.</p>\n<p>A moment later</p>\n<p>Jerry Muskrat bobbed up beside them.</p>\n",
        "<p>You see, they had swum clear across the Smiling Pool and of course they</p>\n<p>could swim no farther.</p>\n<p>So Billy Mink's swimming party was a great success.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER IX PETER RABBIT PLAYS A JOKE</h3>\n<p>One morning when big round Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun was climbing up in the sky and Old</p>\n<p>Mother West Wind had sent all her Merry Little Breezes to play in the</p>\n",
        "<p>Green Meadows, Johnny Chuck started out for a walk.</p>\n<p>First he sat up</p>\n<p>very straight and looked and looked all around to see if Reddy Fox was</p>\n<p>anywhere about, for you know Reddy Fox liked to tease Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>But Reddy Fox was nowhere to be seen, so Johnny Chuck trotted down the</p>\n<p>Lone Little Path to the wood.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Sun was shining as brightly as ever he</p>\n<p>could and Johnny Chuck, who was very, very fat, grew very, very warm.</p>\n<p>By</p>\n<p>and by he sat down on the end of a log under a big tree to rest.</p>\n<p>Thump!</p>\n<p>Something hit Johnny Chuck right on the top of his round little</p>\n<p>head.</p>\n",
        "<p>It made Johnny Chuck jump.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Johnny Chuck!” said a voice that seemed to come right out of the</p>\n<p>sky.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck tipped his head way, way back and looked up.</p>\n<p>He was</p>\n<p>just in time to see Happy Jack Squirrel drop a nut.</p>\n<p>Down it came and hit</p>\n",
        "<p>Johnny Chuck right on the tip of his funny, black, little nose.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” said Johnny Chuck, and tumbled right over back off the log.</p>\n<p>But</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck was so round and so fat and so roly-poly that it didn't</p>\n<p>hurt him a bit.</p>\n<p>“Ha!</p>\n<p>Ha!</p>\n",
        "<p>Ha!” laughed Happy Jack up in the tree.</p>\n<p>“Ha!</p>\n<p>Ha!</p>\n<p>Ha!” laughed Johnny Chuck, picking himself up.</p>\n<p>Then they both</p>\n<p>laughed together.</p>\n<p>It was such a good joke.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What are you laughing at?” asked a voice so close to Johnny Chuck that</p>\n<p>he rolled over three times he was so surprised.</p>\n<p>It was Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing in my wood?” asked Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“I'm taking a walk,” said Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>“Good,” said Peter Rabbit, “I'll come along too.”</p>\n<p>So Johnny Chuck and Peter Rabbit set out along the Lone Little Path</p>\n",
        "<p>through the wood.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit hopped along with great big jumps, for</p>\n<p>Peter's legs are long and meant for jumping, but Johnny Chuck couldn't</p>\n<p>keep up though he tried very hard, for Johnny's legs are short.</p>\n<p>Pretty</p>\n<p>soon Peter Rabbit came back, walking very softly.</p>\n<p>He whispered in Johnny</p>\n",
        "<p>Chuck's ear.</p>\n<p>“I've found something,” said Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” asked Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>“I'll show you,” said Peter Rabbit, “but you must be very, very still,</p>\n<p>and not make the least little bit of noise.”</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck promised to be very, very still for he wanted very much</p>\n<p>to see what Peter Rabbit had found.</p>\n",
        "<p>Peter Rabbit tip-toed down the Lone</p>\n<p>Little Path through the wood, his funny long ears pointing right up to</p>\n<p>the sky.</p>\n<p>And behind him tip-toed Johnny Chuck, wondering and wondering</p>\n<p>what it could be that Peter Rabbit had found.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon they came to a nice mossy green log right across the Lone</p>\n<p>Little Path.</p>\n",
        "<p>Peter Rabbit stopped and sat up very straight.</p>\n<p>He looked</p>\n<p>this way and looked that way.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck stopped too and he sat up</p>\n<p>very straight and looked this way and looked that way, but all he could</p>\n<p>see was the mossy green log across the Lone Little Path.</p>\n<p>“What is it, Peter Rabbit?” whispered Johnny Chuck.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You can't see it yet,” whispered Peter Rabbit, “for first we have to</p>\n<p>jump over that mossy green log.</p>\n<p>Now I'll jump first, and then you jump</p>\n<p>just the way I do, and then you'll see what it is I've found,” said</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>So Peter Rabbit jumped first, and because his legs are long and meant</p>\n<p>for jumping, he jumped way, way over the mossy green log.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then he turned</p>\n<p>around and sat up to see Johnny Chuck jump over the mossy green log,</p>\n<p>too.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck tried to jump very high and very far, just as he had seen</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit jump, but Johnny Chuck's legs are very short and not meant</p>\n<p>for jumping.</p>\n<p>Besides, Johnny Chuck was very, very fat.</p>\n",
        "<p>So though he</p>\n<p>tried very hard indeed to jump just like Peter Rabbit, he stubbed his</p>\n<p>toes on the top of the mossy green log and over he tumbled, head first,</p>\n<p>and landed with a great big thump right on Reddy Fox, who was lying fast</p>\n<p>asleep on the other side of the mossy green log.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit laughed and laughed until he had to hold his sides.</p>\n<p>My, how frightened Johnny Chuck was when he saw what he had done!</p>\n",
        "<p>Before</p>\n<p>he could get on his feet he had rolled right over behind a little bush,</p>\n<p>and there he lay very, very still.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox awoke with a grunt when Johnny Chuck fell on him so hard, and</p>\n<p>the first thing he saw was Peter Rabbit laughing so that he had to hold</p>\n<p>his sides.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox didn't stop to look around.</p>\n",
        "<p>He thought that Peter</p>\n<p>Rabbit had jumped on him.</p>\n<p>Up jumped Reddy Fox and away ran Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>Away went Reddy Fox after Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>Peter dodged behind the trees,</p>\n<p>and jumped over the bushes, and ran this way and ran that way, just as</p>\n<p>hard as ever he could, for Peter Rabbit was very much afraid of Reddy</p>\n",
        "<p>Fox.</p>\n<p>And Reddy Fox followed Peter Rabbit behind the trees and over the</p>\n<p>bushes this way and that way, but he couldn't catch Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>Pretty</p>\n<p>soon Peter Rabbit came to the house of Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>He knew that Jimmy</p>\n<p>Skunk was over in the pasture, so he popped right in and then he was</p>\n",
        "<p>safe, for the door of Jimmy Skunk's house was too small for Reddy Fox to</p>\n<p>squeeze in.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox sat down and waited, but Peter Rabbit didn't</p>\n<p>come out.</p>\n<p>By and by Reddy Fox gave it up and trotted off home where old</p>\n<p>Mother Fox was waiting for him.</p>\n<p>All this time Johnny Chuck had sat very still, watching Reddy Fox try to</p>\n",
        "<p>catch Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>And when he saw Peter Rabbit pop into the house</p>\n<p>of Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox trot away home, Johnny Chuck stood up and</p>\n<p>brushed his little coat very clean and then he trotted back up the Lone</p>\n<p>Little Path through the wood to his own dear little path through the</p>\n<p>Green Meadows where the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind</p>\n<p>were still playing, till he was safe in his own snug little house once</p>\n",

        "<p>coat with white trimmings and his high cap, and he would sit on a fence</p>\n<p>post and make fun of Johnny Chuck working at a new door for his snug</p>\n<p>little home in the Green Meadows, and of Striped Chipmunk storing up</p>\n<p>heaps of corn and nuts for the winter, for most of the time Sammy Jay</p>\n<p>was an idle fellow.</p>\n<p>And when Sammy Jay WAS busy, he was pretty sure</p>\n<p>to be doing something that he ought not to do, for idle people almost</p>\n",
        "<p>always get into mischief.</p>\n<p>Sammy Jay was in mischief now, and that is why he pretended to be doing</p>\n<p>nothing when he thought any one was looking.</p>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind had come down from her home behind the Purple Hills</p>\n<p>very early that morning.</p>\n<p>Indeed, jolly, round, red Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun had hardly</p>\n",
        "<p>gotten out of bed when she crossed the Green Meadows on her way to help</p>\n<p>the big ships across the ocean.</p>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind's eyes were sharp,</p>\n<p>and she saw Sammy Jay before Sammy Jay saw her.</p>\n<p>“Now what can Sammy Jay be so busy about, and why is he so very, very</p>\n<p>quiet?” thought Old Mother West Wind.</p>\n<p>“He must be up to some mischief.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So when she opened her big bag and turned out all her Merry Little</p>\n<p>Breezes to play on the Green Meadows she sent one of them to see what</p>\n<p>Sammy Jay was doing in the old chestnut tree.</p>\n<p>The Merry Little Breeze</p>\n<p>danced along over the tree tops just as if he hadn't a thought in the</p>\n<p>world but to wake up all the little leaves and set them to dancing too,</p>\n<p>and Sammy Jay, watching Old Mother West Wind and the other Merry Little</p>\n",
        "<p>Breezes, didn't see this Merry Little Breeze at all.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon it danced back to Old Mother West Wind and whispered in her</p>\n<p>ear: “Sammy Jay is stealing the nuts Happy Jack Squirrel had hidden in</p>\n<p>the hollow of the old chestnut tree, and is hiding them for himself in</p>\n<p>the tumble down nest that Blacky the Crow built in the Great Pine last</p>\n<p>year.” “Aha!” said Old Mother West Wind.</p>\n<p>Then she went on across the</p>\n",
        "<p>Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Old Mother West Wind,” said Sammy Jay as she passed the</p>\n<p>fence post where he was sitting.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Sammy Jay,” said Old Mother West Wind.</p>\n<p>“What brings you</p>\n<p>out so early in the morning?”</p>\n<p>“I'm out for my health, Old Mother West Wind,” said Sammy Jay politely.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The doctor has ordered me to take a bath in the dew at sunrise every</p>\n<p>morning.”</p>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind said nothing, but went on her way across the Green</p>\n<p>Meadows to blow the ships across the ocean.</p>\n<p>When she had passed, Sammy</p>\n<p>Jay hurried to take the last of Happy Jack's nuts to the old nest in the</p>\n<p>Great Pine.</p>\n",
        "<p>Poor Happy Jack!</p>\n<p>Soon he came dancing along with another nut to put in</p>\n<p>the hollow of the old chestnut tree.</p>\n<p>When he peeped in and saw that all</p>\n<p>his big store of nuts had disappeared, he couldn't believe his own eyes.</p>\n<p>He put in one paw and felt all around but not a nut could he feel.</p>\n<p>Then</p>\n",
        "<p>he climbed in and sure enough, the hollow was empty.</p>\n<p>Poor Happy Jack!</p>\n<p>There were tears in his eyes when he crept out again.</p>\n<p>He looked all around but no one was to be seen but handsome Sammy Jay,</p>\n<p>very busy brushing his beautiful blue coat.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Sammy Jay, have you seen any one pass this way?” asked</p>\n<p>Happy Jack.</p>\n",

        "<p>“It was, but I gave it to my cousin, Sammy Jay,” said Blacky the Crow.</p>\n<p>“Is that your nest, and may I have a stick out of it?” asked Old Mother</p>\n<p>West Wind of Sammy Jay.</p>\n<p>“It is,” said Sammy Jay, with his politest bow, “And you are welcome to</p>\n<p>a stick out of it.” To himself he thought, “She will only take one from</p>\n<p>the top and that won't matter.”</p>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind suddenly puffed out her cheeks and blew so hard</p>\n",
        "<p>that she blew a big stick right out of the bottom of the old nest.</p>\n<p>Down it fell bumpity-bump on the branches of the Great Pine.</p>\n<p>After it</p>\n<p>fell--what do you think?</p>\n<p>Why, hickory nuts and chestnuts and acorns and</p>\n<p>hazel nuts, such a lot of them!</p>\n<p>“Why!</p>\n",
        "<p>Why--e--e!” cried Happy Jack.</p>\n<p>“There are all my stolen nuts!”</p>\n<p>Everybody turned to look at Sammy Jay, but he was flying off through the</p>\n<p>wood as fast as he could go.</p>\n<p>“Stop thief!” cried Old Mother West Wind.</p>\n<p>“Stop thief!” cried all the Merry Little Breezes and Johnny Chuck and</p>\n<p>Billy Mink and all the rest.</p>\n",
        "<p>But Sammy Jay didn't stop.</p>\n<p>Then all began to pick up the nuts that had fallen from the old nest</p>\n<p>where Sammy Jay had hidden them.</p>\n<p>By and by, with Happy Jack leading the</p>\n<p>way, they all marched back to the old chestnut tree and there Happy Jack</p>\n<p>stored all the nuts away in his snug little hollow once more.</p>\n<p>And ever since that day, Sammy Jay, whenever he tries to call, just</p>\n",

        "<p>invitations to a party at the Big Rock in the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>Of course every one said that they would be delighted to go to Jerry</p>\n<p>Muskrat's party.</p>\n<p>Round Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun shone his very brightest.</p>\n<p>The sky was its</p>\n<p>bluest and the little birds had promised to be there to sing for Jerry</p>\n",
        "<p>Muskrat, so of course all the little folks in the Green Meadows and in</p>\n<p>the wood wanted to go.</p>\n<p>There were Johnny Chuck and Reddy Fox and Jimmy Skunk and Bobby Coon and</p>\n<p>Happy Jack Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and Billy Mink and Little Joe</p>\n<p>Otter and Grandfather Frog and old Mr.</p>\n<p>Toad and Mr.</p>\n<p>Blacksnake--all</p>\n",
        "<p>going to Jerry Muskrat's party.</p>\n<p>When they reached the Smiling Pool they found Jerry Muskrat all ready.</p>\n<p>His brothers and his sister, his aunts and his uncles and his cousins</p>\n<p>were all there.</p>\n<p>Such a merry, merry time as there was in the Smiling</p>\n<p>Pool!</p>\n<p>How the water did splash!</p>\n",
        "<p>Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter and</p>\n<p>Grandfather Frog jumped right in as soon as they got there.</p>\n<p>They played</p>\n<p>tag in the water and hid behind the Big Rock.</p>\n<p>They turned somersaults</p>\n<p>down the slippery slide and they had such a good time!</p>\n<p>But Reddy Fox and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon and Johnny Chuck and Jimmy</p>\n",
        "<p>Skunk and Happy Jack and Striped Chipmunk couldn't swim, so of course</p>\n<p>they couldn't play tag in the water or hide and seek or go down the</p>\n<p>slippery slide; all they could do was sit around to look on and wish</p>\n<p>that they knew how to swim, too.</p>\n<p>So of course they didn't have a good</p>\n<p>time.</p>\n<p>Soon they began to wish that they hadn't come to Jerry Muskrat's</p>\n",
        "<p>party.</p>\n<p>When he found that they were not having a good time, poor Jerry</p>\n<p>Muskrat felt very badly indeed.</p>\n<p>You see he lives in the water so much</p>\n<p>that he had quite forgotten that there was anyone who couldn't swim, or</p>\n<p>he never, never would have invited all the little meadow folks who live</p>\n<p>on dry land.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Let's go home,” said Peter Rabbit to Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>“We can have more fun up on the hill,” said Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>Just then Little Joe Otter came pushing a great big log across the</p>\n<p>Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>“Here's a ship, Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>You get on one end and I'll give you a sail</p>\n<p>across the Smiling Pool,” shouted Little Joe Otter.</p>\n",
        "<p>So Bobby Coon crawled out on the big log and held on very tight, while</p>\n<p>little Joe Otter swam behind and pushed the big log.</p>\n<p>Across the Smiling</p>\n<p>Pool they went and back again.</p>\n<p>Bobby Coon had such a good ride that he</p>\n<p>wanted to go again, but Jimmy Skunk wanted a ride.</p>\n<p>So Bobby Coon hopped</p>\n",
        "<p>off of the big log and Jimmy Skunk hopped on and away he went across the</p>\n<p>Smiling Pool with little Joe Otter pushing behind.</p>\n<p>Then Jerry Muskrat found another log and gave Peter Rabbit a ride.</p>\n<p>Jerry</p>\n<p>Muskrat's brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and cousins found</p>\n<p>logs and took Reddy Fox and Johnny Chuck and even Mr.</p>\n<p>Toad back and</p>\n",
        "<p>forth across the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>Happy Jack Squirrel sat up very straight on the end of his log and</p>\n<p>spread his great bushy tail for a sail.</p>\n<p>All the little Breezes blew and</p>\n<p>blew and Happy Jack Squirrel sailed round and round the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>Sometimes someone would fall off into the water and get wet, but Jerry</p>\n<p>Muskrat or Billy Mink always pulled them out again, and no one cared the</p>\n",
        "<p>tiniest bit for a wetting.</p>\n<p>In the bushes around the Smiling Pool the little birds sang and</p>\n<p>sang.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox barked his loudest.</p>\n<p>Happy Jack Squirrel chattered</p>\n<p>and chir--r--r--ed.</p>\n<p>All the muskrats squealed and squeaked, for Jerry</p>\n",
        "<p>Muskrat's party was such fun!</p>\n<p>By and by when Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun went down behind the Purple Hills to his home and</p>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind with all her Merry Little Breezes went after him,</p>\n<p>and the little stars came out to twinkle and twinkle, the Smiling Pool</p>\n<p>lay all quiet and still, but smiling and smiling to think what a good</p>\n<p>time every one had had at Jerry Muskrat's party.</p>\n",
        "<h3>CHAPTER XII BOBBY COON AND REDDY FOX PLAY TRICKS</h3>\n<p>It was night.</p>\n<p>All the little stars were looking down and twinkling and</p>\n<p>twinkling.</p>\n<p>Mother Moon was doing her best to make the Green Meadows as</p>\n<p>light as Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun did in the daytime.</p>\n",
        "<p>All the little birds except Hooty</p>\n<p>the Owl and Boomer the Night Hawk, and noisy Mr.</p>\n<p>Whip-poor-will were</p>\n<p>fast asleep in their little nests.</p>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind's Merry Little</p>\n<p>Breezes had all gone to sleep, too.</p>\n<p>It was oh so still!</p>\n",
        "<p>Indeed it was so</p>\n<p>very still that Bobby Coon, coming down the Lone Little Path through the</p>\n<p>wood, began to talk to himself.</p>\n<p>“I don't see what people want to play all day and sleep all night for,”</p>\n<p>said Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>“Night's the best time to be about.</p>\n<p>Now Reddy Fox--”</p>\n",
        "<p>“Be careful what you say about Reddy Fox,” said a voice right behind</p>\n<p>Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>Bobby Coon turned around very quickly indeed, for he had thought he was</p>\n<p>all alone.</p>\n<p>There was Reddy Fox himself, trotting down the Lone Little</p>\n<p>Path through the wood.</p>\n<p>“I thought you were home and fast asleep, Reddy Fox,” said Bobby Coon.</p>\n",
        "<p>“You were mistaken,” said Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>“For you see I'm out to take a walk</p>\n<p>in the moonlight.”</p>\n<p>So Bobby Coon and Reddy Fox walked together down the Lone Little Path</p>\n<p>through the wood to the Green Meadows.</p>\n<p>They met Jimmy Skunk, who had</p>\n<p>dreamed that there were a lot of beetles up on the hill, and was just</p>\n",
        "<p>going to climb the Crooked Little Path to see.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Jimmy Skunk!” said Bobby Coon and Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>“Come down to the</p>\n<p>Green Meadows with us.”</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk said he would, so they all went down on the Green Meadows</p>\n<p>together, Bobby Coon first, Reddy Fox next and Jimmy Skunk last of all,</p>\n<p>for Jimmy Skunk never hurries.</p>\n",
        "<p>Pretty soon they came to the house of</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>“Listen,” said Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>“Johnny Chuck is fast asleep.”</p>\n<p>They all listened and they could hear Johnny Chuck snoring away down in</p>\n<p>his snug little bed.</p>\n<p>“Let's give Johnny Chuck a surprise,” said Reddy Fox.</p>\n",
        "<p>“What shall it be?” asked Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>“I know,” said Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>“Let's roll that big stone right over Johnny</p>\n<p>Chuck's doorway; then he'll have to dig his way out in the morning.”</p>\n<p>So Bobby Coon and Reddy Fox pulled and tugged and tugged and pulled at</p>\n<p>the big stone till they had rolled it over Johnny Chuck's doorway.</p>\n<p>Jimmy</p>\n",
        "<p>Skunk pretended not to see what they were doing.</p>\n<p>“Now let's go down to the Laughing Brook and wake up old Grandfather</p>\n<p>Frog and hear him say 'Chug-a-rum,'” said Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>“Come on!” cried Reddy Fox, “I'll get there first!”</p>\n<p>Away raced Reddy Fox down the Lone Little Path and after him ran Bobby</p>\n<p>Coon, going to wake old Grandfather Frog from a nice comfortable sleep</p>\n<p>on his green lily pad.</p>\n",
        "<p>But Jimmy Skunk didn't go.</p>\n<p>He watched Reddy Fox and Bobby Coon until</p>\n<p>they were nearly to the Laughing Brook.</p>\n<p>Then he began to dig at one side</p>\n<p>of the big stone which filled the doorway of Johnny Chuck's house.</p>\n<p>My,</p>\n<p>how he made the dirt fly!</p>\n",
        "<p>Pretty soon he had made a hole big enough to</p>\n<p>call through to Johnny Chuck, who was snoring away, fast asleep in his</p>\n<p>snug little bed below.</p>\n<p>“Johnny Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!</p>\n<p>Johnny Woodchuck!” called Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>But Johnny Chuck just snored.</p>\n<p>“Johnny Chuck, Chuck, Chuck!</p>\n",
        "<p>Johnny Woodchuck!” called Jimmy Skunk once</p>\n<p>more.</p>\n<p>But Johnny Chuck just snored.</p>\n<p>Then Jimmy Skunk called again, this time</p>\n<p>louder than before.</p>\n<p>“Who is it?” asked a very sleepy voice.</p>\n<p>“It's Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n",
        "<p>Put your coat on and come up here!” called Jimmy</p>\n<p>Skunk.</p>\n<p>“Go away, Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<h3>I want to sleep!” said Johnny Chuck.</h3>\n<p>“I've got a surprise for you, Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>You'd better come!” called</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk through the little hole he had made.</p>\n",
        "<p>When Johnny Chuck heard</p>\n<p>that Jimmy Skunk had a surprise for him he wanted to know right away</p>\n<p>what it could be, so though he was very, very sleepy, he put on his</p>\n<p>coat and started up for his door to see what the surprise was that Jimmy</p>\n<p>Skunk had.</p>\n<p>And there he found the big stone Reddy Fox and Bobby Coon had</p>\n<p>put there, and of course he was very much surprised indeed.</p>\n",
        "<p>He thought</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk had played him a mean trick and for a few minutes he was</p>\n<p>very mad.</p>\n<p>But Jimmy Skunk soon told him who had filled up his doorway</p>\n<p>with the big stone.</p>\n<p>“Now you push from that side, Johnny Chuck, and I'll pull from this</p>\n<p>side, and we'll soon have this big stone out of your doorway,” said</p>\n",
        "<p>Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>So Johnny Chuck pushed and Jimmy Skunk pulled, and sure enough they soon</p>\n<p>had the big stone out of Johnny Chuck's doorway.</p>\n<p>“Now,” said Jimmy Skunk, “we'll roll this big stone down the Lone Little</p>\n<p>Path to Reddy Fox's house and we'll give Reddy Fox a surprise.”</p>\n<p>So Johnny Chuck and Jimmy Skunk tugged and pulled and rolled the big</p>\n<p>stone down to the house of Reddy Fox, and sure enough, it filled his</p>\n",
        "<p>doorway.</p>\n<p>“Good night, Jimmy Skunk,” said Johnny Chuck, and trotted down the Lone</p>\n<p>Little Path toward home, chuckling to himself all the way.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Skunk walked slowly up the Lone Little Path to the wood, for Jimmy</p>\n<p>Skunk never hurries.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon he came to the big hollow tree where</p>\n<p>Bobby Coon lives, and there he met Hooty the Owl.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Hello, Jimmy Skunk, where have you been?” asked Hooty the Owl.</p>\n<p>“Just for a walk,” said Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>“Who lives in this big hollow</p>\n<p>tree?”</p>\n<p>Now of course Jimmy Skunk knew all the time, but he pretended he didn't.</p>\n<p>“Oh, this is Bobby Coon's house,” said Hooty the Owl.</p>\n<p>“Let's give Bobby Coon a surprise,” said Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n",
        "<p>“How?” asked Hooty the Owl.</p>\n<p>“We'll fill his house full of sticks and leaves,” said Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>Hooty the Owl thought that would be a good joke so while Jimmy Skunk</p>\n<p>gathered all the old sticks and leaves he could find, Hooty the Owl</p>\n<p>stuffed them into the old hollow tree which was Bobby Coon's house,</p>\n<p>until he couldn't get in another one.</p>\n<p>“Good night,” said Jimmy Skunk as he began to climb the Crooked Little</p>\n",
        "<p>Path up the hill to his own snug little home.</p>\n<p>“Good night,” said Hooty the Owl, as he flew like a big soft shadow over</p>\n<p>to the Great Pine.</p>\n<p>By and by when old Mother Moon was just going to bed and all the little</p>\n<p>stars were too sleepy to twinkle any longer, Reddy Fox and Bobby Coon,</p>\n<p>very tired and very wet from playing in the Laughing Brook, came up the</p>\n<p>Lone Little Path, ready to tumble into their snug little beds.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were</p>\n<p>chuckling over the trick they had played on Johnny Chuck, and the way</p>\n<p>they had waked up old Grandfather Frog, and all the other mischief they</p>\n<p>had done.</p>\n<p>What do you suppose they said when they reached their homes</p>\n<p>and found that someone else had been playing jokes, too?</p>\n<p>I'm sure I don't know, but round, red Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Sun was laughing very hard as</p>\n<p>he peeped over the hill at Reddy Fox and Bobby Coon, and he won't tell</p>\n<p>why.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER XIII JOHNNY CHUCK FINDS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD</h3>\n<p>Old Mother West Wind had stopped to talk with the Slender Fir Tree.</p>\n<p>“I've just come across the Green Meadows,” said Old Mother West Wind,</p>\n<p>“and there I saw the Best Thing in the World.”</p>\n",
        "<p>Striped Chipmunk was sitting under the Slender Fir Tree and he couldn't</p>\n<p>help hearing what Old Mother West Wind said.</p>\n<p>“The Best Thing in the</p>\n<p>World--now what can that be?” thought Striped Chipmunk.</p>\n<p>“Why, it must be</p>\n<p>heaps and heaps of nuts and acorns!</p>\n<p>I'll go and find it.”</p>\n",
        "<p>So Striped Chipmunk started down the Lone Little Path through the wood</p>\n<p>as fast as he could run.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon he met Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going in such a hurry, Striped Chipmunk?” asked Peter</p>\n<p>Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“Down in the Green Meadows to find the Best Thing in the World,” replied</p>\n<p>Striped Chipmunk, and ran faster.</p>\n",
        "<p>“The Best Thing in the World,” said Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>“Why, that must be</p>\n<p>great piles of carrots and cabbage!</p>\n<h3>I think I'll go and find it.”</h3>\n<p>So Peter Rabbit started down the Lone Little Path through the wood as</p>\n<p>fast as he could go after Striped Chipmunk.</p>\n<p>As they passed the great hollow tree Bobby Coon put his head out.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Where</p>\n<p>are you going in such a hurry?” asked Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>“Down in the Green Meadows to find the Best Thing in the World!” shouted</p>\n<p>Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit, and both began to run faster.</p>\n<p>“The Best Thing in the World,” said Bobby Coon to himself.</p>\n<p>“Why, that</p>\n<p>must be a whole field of sweet milky corn.</p>\n",
        "<h3>I think I'll go and find it.”</h3>\n<p>So Bobby Coon climbed down out of the great hollow tree and started</p>\n<p>down the Lone Little Path through the wood as fast as he could go after</p>\n<p>Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit, for there is nothing that Bobby Coon</p>\n<p>likes to eat so well as sweet milky corn.</p>\n<p>At the edge of the wood they met Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going in such a hurry?” asked Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Down in the Green Meadows to find the Best Thing in the World!” shouted</p>\n<p>Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>Then they all tried to</p>\n<p>run faster.</p>\n<p>“The Best Thing in the World,” said Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n<p>“Why, that must be</p>\n<p>packs and packs of beetles!” And for once in his life Jimmy Skunk began</p>\n",
        "<p>to hurry down the Lone Little Path after Striped Chipmunk and Peter</p>\n<p>Rabbit and Bobby Coon.</p>\n<p>They were all running so fast that they didn't see Reddy Fox until he</p>\n<p>jumped out of the long grass and asked: “Where are you going in such a</p>\n<p>hurry?”</p>\n<p>“To find the Best Thing in the World!” shouted Striped Chipmunk and</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk, and each did his best to</p>\n",
        "<p>run faster.</p>\n<p>“The Best Thing in the World,” said Reddy Fox to himself.</p>\n<p>“Why, that</p>\n<p>must be a whole pen full of tender young chickens, and I must have</p>\n<p>them.”</p>\n<p>So away went Reddy Fox as fast as he could run down the Lone Little Path</p>\n<p>after Striped Chipmunk, Peter Rabbit, Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk.</p>\n",
        "<p>By and by they all came to the house of Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going in such a hurry?” asked Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>“To find the Best Thing in the World,” shouted Striped Chipmunk and</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox.</p>\n<p>“The Best Thing in the World,” said Johnny Chuck.</p>\n<p>“Why, I don't know of</p>\n<p>anything better than my own little home and the warm sunshine and the</p>\n",

        "<p>Granny Otter.</p>\n<p>They had played tag with the Merry Little Breezes.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>had been in all kinds of mischief and now they just didn't know what to</p>\n<p>do.</p>\n<p>They were sitting side by side on the Big Rock trying to push each other</p>\n<p>off into the Smiling Pool.</p>\n",
        "<p>Round, smiling red Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun made the Green</p>\n<p>Meadows very warm indeed, and Reddy Fox, over in the tall grass, heard</p>\n<p>them splashing and shouting and having such a good time that he wished</p>\n<p>he liked the nice cool water and could swim, too.</p>\n<p>“I've thought of something!” cried Little Joe Otter.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” asked Billy Mink.</p>\n",
        "<p>Little Joe Otter just looked wise and said nothing.</p>\n<p>“Something to eat?” asked Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“No,” said Little Joe Otter.</p>\n<p>“I don't believe you've a thought of anything at all,” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“I have too!” said Little Joe Otter.</p>\n<p>“It's something to do.”</p>\n<p>“What?” demanded Billy Mink.</p>\n",
        "<p>Just then Little Joe Otter spied Jerry Muskrat.</p>\n<p>“Hi, Jerry Muskrat!</p>\n<p>Come</p>\n<p>over here!” he called.</p>\n<p>Jerry Muskrat swam across to the Big Rock and climbed up beside Billy</p>\n<p>Mink and Little Joe Otter.</p>\n<p>“What are you fellows doing?” asked Jerry Muskrat.</p>\n",

        "<p>“Never mind,” said Billy Mink.</p>\n<p>“Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun will dry you off.”</p>\n<p>“And we'll help,” said all the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West</p>\n<p>Wind.</p>\n<p>But Peter Rabbit shook his head and said, “No.”</p>\n<p>Faster and faster went Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat</p>\n",
        "<p>and old Grandfather Frog down the slippery slide into the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit kept coming nearer and nearer until finally he stood right</p>\n<p>at the top of the slippery slide.</p>\n<p>Billy Mink crept up behind him very</p>\n<p>softly and gave him a push.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit's long legs flew out from under</p>\n<p>him and down he sat with a thump on the slippery slide.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Oh,” cried</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit, and tried to stop himself.</p>\n<p>But he couldn't do it and so</p>\n<p>away he went down the slippery slide, splash into the Smiling Pool.</p>\n<p>“Ha!</p>\n<p>ha!</p>\n<p>ha!” laughed Billy Mink.</p>\n",
        "<p>“Ho!</p>\n<p>ho!</p>\n<p>ho!” shouted Little Joe Otter.</p>\n<p>“He!</p>\n<p>he!</p>\n<p>he!” laughed Jerry Muskrat and old Grandfather Frog and</p>\n<p>Sammy Jay and Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox and Blacky the Crow and Mr.</p>\n",

        "<p>Trout, and a whole lot of little Trouts.</p>\n<p>There were so</p>\n<p>many little Trouts that Mr.</p>\n<p>Trout and Mrs.</p>\n<p>Trout were kept very busy</p>\n<p>indeed getting breakfast and dinner and supper for them, and watching</p>\n<p>out for them and teaching them how to swim and how to catch foolish</p>\n",
        "<p>little flies that sometimes fell on the water and how to keep out of</p>\n<p>the way of big hungry fish and sharp eyed Mr.</p>\n<p>Kingfisher and big men and</p>\n<p>little boys who came fishing with hooks and lines.</p>\n<p>Now all the little Trouts were very, very good and minded just what Mrs.</p>\n<p>Trout told them--all but Tommy Trout, for Tommy Trout--oh, dear, dear!</p>\n<p>Tommy Trout never could mind right away.</p>\n",
        "<p>He always had to wait a little</p>\n<p>instead of minding when he was spoken to.</p>\n<p>Tommy Trout didn't mean to be bad.</p>\n<p>Oh dear, no!</p>\n<p>He just wanted to have</p>\n<p>his own way, and because Tommy Trout had his own way and didn't mind</p>\n<p>Mrs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Trout there isn't any Tommy Trout now.</p>\n<p>No sir, there isn't as much</p>\n<p>as one little blue spot of his beautiful little coat left because--why,</p>\n<p>just because Tommy Trout didn't mind.</p>\n<p>One day when round, red Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun was shining and the Laughing Brook was</p>\n<p>singing on its way to join the Big River, Mrs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Trout started to get some</p>\n<p>nice plump flies for dinner.</p>\n<p>All the little Trouts were playing in their</p>\n<p>dear little pool, safe behind the Big Rock.</p>\n<p>Before she started Mrs.</p>\n<p>Trout called all the little Trouts around her and told them not to</p>\n<p>leave their little pool while she was gone, “For,” said she, “something</p>\n",
        "<p>dreadful might happen to you.”</p>\n<p>All the little Trouts, except Tommy Trout, promised that they would</p>\n<p>surely, surely stay inside their dear little pool.</p>\n<p>Then they all began</p>\n<p>to jump and chase each other and play as happy as could be, all but</p>\n<p>Tommy Trout.</p>\n<p>As soon as Mrs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Trout had started, Tommy Trout swam off by himself to</p>\n<p>the edge of the pool.</p>\n<p>“I wonder what is on the other side of the Big</p>\n<p>Rock,” said Tommy Trout.</p>\n<p>“The sun is shining and the brook is laughing</p>\n<p>and nothing could happen if I go just a little speck of a ways.”</p>\n<p>So, when no one was looking, Tommy Trout slipped out of the safe little</p>\n",
        "<p>pool where all the other little Trouts were playing.</p>\n<p>He swam just a</p>\n<p>little speck of a ways farther still.</p>\n<p>Now he could see almost around</p>\n<p>the Big Rock.</p>\n<p>Then he swam just a little speck of a ways farther and--oh</p>\n<p>dear, dear!</p>\n",
        "<p>he looked right into the mouth of a great big, big fish</p>\n<p>called Mr.</p>\n<p>Pickerel, who is very fond of little Trouts and would like to</p>\n<p>eat one for breakfast every day.</p>\n<p>“Ah ha!” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Pickerel, opening his big, big mouth very, very wide.</p>\n<p>Tommy Trout turned to run back to the dear, dear safe little pool where</p>\n",
        "<p>all the other little Trouts were playing so happily, but he was too</p>\n<p>late.</p>\n<p>Into that great big, big mouth he went instead, and Mr.</p>\n<p>Pickerel</p>\n<p>swallowed him whole.</p>\n<p>“Ah ha,” said Mr.</p>\n<p>Pickerel, “I like little Trouts.”</p>\n",
        "<p>And nothing more was ever heard of Tommy Trout, who didn't mind.</p>\n<h3>CHAPTER XVI SPOTTY THE TURTLE WINS A RACE</h3>\n<p>All the little people who live on the Green Meadows and in the Smiling</p>\n<p>Pool and along the Laughing Brook were to have a holiday.</p>\n<p>The Merry</p>\n<p>Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind had been very busy, oh very busy</p>\n<p>indeed, in sending word to all the little meadow folks.</p>\n",
        "<p>You see, Peter</p>\n<p>Rabbit had been boasting of how fast he could run.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox was quite</p>\n<p>sure that he could run faster than Peter Rabbit.</p>\n<p>Billy Mink, who can</p>\n<p>move so quickly you hardly can see him, was quite sure that neither</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit nor Reddy Fox could run as fast as he.</p>\n",
        "<p>They all met one</p>\n<p>day beside the Smiling Pool and agreed that old Grandfather Frog should</p>\n<p>decide who was the swiftest.</p>\n<p>Now Grandfather Frog was accounted very wise.</p>\n<p>You see he had lived a</p>\n<p>long time, oh, very much longer than any of the others, and therefore,</p>\n<p>because of the wisdom of age, Grandfather Frog was always called on to</p>\n",
        "<p>decide all disputes.</p>\n<p>He sat on his green lily-pad while Billy Mink sat</p>\n<p>on the Big Rock, and Peter Rabbit and Reddy Fox sat on the bank.</p>\n<p>Each</p>\n<p>in turn told why he thought he was the fastest.</p>\n<p>Old Grandfather Frog</p>\n<p>listened and listened and said never a word until they were all through.</p>\n",
        "<p>When they had finished, he stopped to catch a foolish green fly and then</p>\n<p>he said: “The best way to decide who is the swiftest is to have a race.”</p>\n<p>So it was agreed that Peter Rabbit and Reddy Fox and Billy Mink should</p>\n<p>start together from the old butternut tree on one edge of the Green</p>\n<p>Meadows, race away across the Green Meadows to the little hill on the</p>\n<p>other side and each bring back a nut from the big hickory which grew</p>\n<p>there.</p>\n",
        "<p>The one who first reached the old butternut tree with a hickory</p>\n<p>nut would be declared the winner.</p>\n<p>The Merry Little Breezes flew about</p>\n<p>over the Green Meadows telling everyone about the race and everyone</p>\n<p>planned to be there.</p>\n<p>It was a beautiful summer day.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n",
        "<p>Sun smiled and smiled, and the</p>\n<p>more he smiled the warmer it grew.</p>\n<p>Everyone was there to see the</p>\n<p>race--Striped Chipmunk, Happy Jack Squirrel, Sammy Jay, Blacky the Crow,</p>\n<p>Hooty the Owl and Bobby Coon all sat up in the old butternut tree where</p>\n<p>it was cool and shady.</p>\n<p>Johnny Chuck, Jerry Muskrat, Jimmy Skunk, Little</p>\n",
        "<p>Joe Otter, Grandfather Frog and even old Mr.</p>\n<p>Toad, were there.</p>\n<p>Last of</p>\n<p>all came Spotty the Turtle.</p>\n<p>Now Spotty the Turtle is a very slow walker,</p>\n<p>and he cannot run at all.</p>\n<p>When Peter Rabbit saw him coming up towards</p>\n",
        "<p>the old butternut tree he shouted: “Come, Spotty, don't you want to race</p>\n<p>with us?”</p>\n<p>Everybody laughed because you know Spotty is so very, very slow but</p>\n<p>Spotty didn't laugh and he didn't get cross because everyone else</p>\n<p>laughed.</p>\n<p>“There is a wise old saying, Peter Rabbit,” said Spotty the Turtle,</p>\n<p>“which shows that those who run fastest do not always reach a place</p>\n",
        "<p>first.</p>\n<h3>I think I WILL enter this race.”</h3>\n<p>Every one thought that that was the best joke they had heard for a long</p>\n<p>time, and all laughed harder than ever.</p>\n<p>They all agreed that Spotty the</p>\n<p>Turtle should start in the race too.</p>\n<p>So they all stood in a row, Peter Rabbit first, the Billy Mink, then</p>\n",
        "<p>Reddy Fox, and right side of Reddy Fox Spotty the Turtle.</p>\n<p>“Are you ready?” asked Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>“Go!”</p>\n<p>Away went Peter Rabbit with great big jumps.</p>\n<p>After him went Billy Mink</p>\n<p>so fast that was just a little brown streak going through the tall</p>\n<p>grass, and side by side with him ran Reddy Fox.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now just as they started</p>\n<p>Spotty the Turtle reached up and grabbed the long hair on the end of</p>\n<p>Reddy's big tail.</p>\n<p>Of course Reddy couldn't have stopped to shake him</p>\n<p>off, because Peter Rabbit and Billy Mink were running so fast that he</p>\n<p>had to run his very best to keep up with them.</p>\n<p>But he didn't even know</p>\n",
        "<p>that Spotty the Turtle was there.</p>\n<p>You see Spotty is not very heavy and</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox was so excited that he did not notice that his big tail was</p>\n<p>heavier than usual.</p>\n<p>The Merry Little Breezes flew along, too, to see that the race was fair.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit went with great big jumps.</p>\n<p>Whenever he came to a little</p>\n",
        "<p>bush he jumped right over it, for Peter Rabbit's legs are long and meant</p>\n<p>for jumping.</p>\n<p>Billy Mink is so slim that he slipped between the bushes</p>\n<p>and through the long grass like a little brown streak.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox, who is</p>\n<p>bigger than either Peter Rabbit or Billy Mink, had no trouble in keeping</p>\n<p>up with them.</p>\n",
        "<p>Not one of them noticed that Spotty the Turtle was hanging</p>\n<p>fast to the end of Reddy's tail.</p>\n<p>Now just at the foot of the little hill on which the big hickory tree</p>\n<p>grew was a little pond.</p>\n<p>It wasn't very wide but it was quite long.</p>\n<p>Billy</p>\n<p>Mink remembered this pond and he chuckled to himself as he raced along,</p>\n",
        "<p>for he knew that Peter Rabbit couldn't swim and he knew that Reddy Fox</p>\n<p>does not like the water, so therefore both would have to run around it.</p>\n<p>He himself can swim even faster than he can run.</p>\n<p>The more he thought of</p>\n<p>this, the more foolish it seemed that he should hurry so on such a warm</p>\n<p>day.</p>\n<p>“For,” said Billy Mink to himself, “even if they reach the pond</p>\n",
        "<p>first, they will have to run around it, while I can swim across it and</p>\n<p>cool off while I am swimming.</p>\n<h3>I will surely get there first.” So Billy</h3>\n<p>Mink ran slower and slower, and pretty soon he had dropped behind.</p>\n<p>Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun, round and red, looking down, smiled and smiled to see the race.</p>\n<p>The more he smiled the warmer it grew.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now, Peter Rabbit had a thick</p>\n<p>gray coat and Reddy Fox had a thick red coat, and they both began to get</p>\n<p>very, very warm.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit did not make such long jumps as when he</p>\n<p>first started.</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox began to feel very thirsty, and his tongue hung</p>\n<p>out.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now that Billy Mink was behind them they thought they did not need</p>\n<p>to hurry so.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit reached the little pond first.</p>\n<p>He had not thought of that</p>\n<p>pond when he agreed to enter the race.</p>\n<p>He stopped right on the edge</p>\n<p>of it and sat up on his hind legs.</p>\n",
        "<p>Right across he could see the big</p>\n<p>hickory tree, so near and yet so far, for he knew that he must run</p>\n<p>around the pond then back again, and it was a long, long way.</p>\n<p>In just</p>\n<p>a moment Reddy Fox ran out of the bushes and Reddy felt much as</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit did.</p>\n<p>Way, way behind them was Billy Mink, trotting along</p>\n",
        "<p>comfortably and chuckling to himself.</p>\n<p>Peter Rabbit looked at Reddy Fox</p>\n<p>in dismay, and Reddy Fox looked at Peter Rabbit in dismay.</p>\n<p>Then they</p>\n<p>both looked at Billy Mink and remembered that Billy Mink could swim</p>\n<p>right across.</p>\n<p>Then off Peter Rabbit started as fast as he could go around the pond one</p>\n",
        "<p>way, and Reddy Fox started around the pond the other way.</p>\n<p>They were</p>\n<p>so excited that neither noticed a little splash in the pond.</p>\n<p>That was</p>\n<p>Spotty the Turtle who had let go of Reddy's tail and now was swimming</p>\n<p>across the pond, for you know that Spotty is a splendid swimmer.</p>\n<p>Only</p>\n",
        "<p>once or twice he stuck his little black nose up to get some air.</p>\n<p>The</p>\n<p>rest of the time he swam under water and no one but the Merry Little</p>\n<p>Breezes saw him.</p>\n<p>Right across he swam, and climbed up the bank right</p>\n<p>under the big hickory tree.</p>\n<p>Now there were just three nuts left under the hickory trees.</p>\n",
        "<p>Two of</p>\n<p>these Spotty took down to the edge of the pond and buried in the mud.</p>\n<p>The other he took in his mouth and started back across the pond.</p>\n<p>Just as</p>\n<p>he reached the other shore up trotted Billy Mink, but Billy Mink didn't</p>\n<p>see Spotty.</p>\n<p>He was too intent watching Reddy Fox and Peter Rabbit, who</p>\n",
        "<p>were now half way around the pond.</p>\n<p>In he jumped with a splash.</p>\n<p>My!</p>\n<p>How</p>\n<p>good that cool water did feel!</p>\n<p>He didn't have to hurry now, because he</p>\n<p>felt sure that the race was his.</p>\n",
        "<p>So he swam round and round and chased</p>\n<p>some fish and had a beautiful time in the water.</p>\n<p>By and by he looked up</p>\n<p>and saw that Peter Rabbit was almost around the pond one way and Reddy</p>\n<p>Fox was almost around the pond the other way.</p>\n<p>They both looked tired and</p>\n<p>hot and discouraged.</p>\n",
        "<p>Then Billy Mink swam slowly across and climbed out on the bank under the</p>\n<p>big hickory tree.</p>\n<p>But where were the nuts?</p>\n<p>Look as he would, he could</p>\n<p>not see a nut anywhere, yet the Merry Little Breezes had said there were</p>\n<p>three nuts lying under the hickory tree.</p>\n<p>Billy Mink ran this way and</p>\n",
        "<p>ran that way.</p>\n<p>He was still running around, poking over the leaves and</p>\n<p>looking under the twigs and pieces of bark when Peter Rabbit and Reddy</p>\n<p>Fox came up.</p>\n<p>Then they, too, began to look under the leaves and under the bark.</p>\n<p>They</p>\n<p>pawed around in the grass, they hunted in every nook and cranny, but</p>\n",
        "<p>not a nut could they find.</p>\n<p>They were tired and cross and hot and</p>\n<p>they accused Billy Mink of having hidden the nuts.</p>\n<p>Billy Mink stoutly</p>\n<p>insisted that he had not hidden the nuts, that he had not found the</p>\n<p>nuts, and when they saw how hard he was hunting they believed him.</p>\n<p>All the afternoon they hunted and hunted and hunted, and all the</p>\n",
        "<p>afternoon Spotty the Turtle, with the nut in his mouth, was slowly, oh,</p>\n<p>so slowly, crawling straight back across the Green Meadows towards the</p>\n<p>old butternut tree.</p>\n<p>Round, red Mr.</p>\n<p>Sun was getting very close to the</p>\n<p>Purple Hills, where he goes to bed every night, and all the little</p>\n<p>meadow folks were getting ready to go to their homes.</p>\n",
        "<p>They were</p>\n<p>wondering and wondering what could have happened to the racers, when</p>\n<p>Sammy Jay spied the Merry Little Breezes dancing across the Green</p>\n<p>Meadows.</p>\n<p>“Here come the Merry Little Breezes; they'll tell us who wins the race,”</p>\n<p>cried Sammy Jay.</p>\n<p>When the Merry Little Breezes reached the old butternut tree, all the</p>\n",
        "<p>little meadow folks crowded around them, but the Merry Little Breezes</p>\n<p>just laughed and laughed and wouldn't say a word.</p>\n<p>Then all of a sudden,</p>\n<p>out of the tall meadow grass crept Spotty the Turtle and laid the</p>\n<p>hickory nut at the feet of old Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>Old Grandfather Frog</p>\n<p>was so surprised that he actually let a great green fly buzz right past</p>\n",
        "<p>his nose.</p>\n<p>“Where did you get that hickory nut?” asked Grandfather Frog.</p>\n<p>“Under the big hickory tree on the hill on the other side of the Green</p>\n<p>Meadows,” said Spotty.</p>\n<p>Then all the Merry Little Breezes clapped their hands and shouted: “He</p>\n<p>did!</p>\n<p>He did!</p>\n",
        "<p>Spotty wins the race!”</p>\n<p>Then they told how Spotty reached the pond by clinging to the tip of</p>\n<p>Reddy Fox's tail, and had hidden the other two nuts, and then how he had</p>\n<p>patiently crawled home while Billy Mink and Reddy Fox and Peter Rabbit</p>\n<p>were hunting and hunting and hunting for the nuts they could not find.</p>\n<p>And so Spotty the Turtle was awarded the race, and to this day Peter</p>\n<p>Rabbit and Reddy Fox and Billy Mink can't bear the sight of a hickory</p>\n",
