        "<h3>Letter 2</h3>\n<p>_To Mrs. Saville, England._</p>\n<p>Archangel, 28th March, 17—.</p>\n<p>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!</p>\n<p>Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a</p>\n<p>vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have</p>\n<p>already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly</p>",
        "<p>possessed of dauntless courage.</p>\n<p>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the</p>\n<p>absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no</p>\n<p>friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there</p>\n<p>will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no</p>\n<p>one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts</p>\n<p>to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of</p>",
        "<p>feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose</p>\n<p>eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I</p>\n<p>bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet</p>\n<p>courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose</p>\n<p>tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a</p>\n<p>friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution</p>\n<p>and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me</p>",
        "<p>that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild</p>\n<p>on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.</p>\n<p>At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own</p>\n<p>country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its</p>\n<p>most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the</p>\n<p>necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native</p>\n<p>country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many</p>",
        "<p>schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my</p>\n<p>daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters</p>\n<p>call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense</p>\n<p>enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to</p>\n<p>endeavour to regulate my mind.</p>\n<p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the</p>\n<p>wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet</p>",
        "<p>some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these</p>\n<p>rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage</p>\n<p>and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase</p>\n<p>more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an</p>\n<p>Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,</p>\n<p>unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of</p>\n<p>humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;</p>",
        "<p>finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist</p>\n<p>in my enterprise.</p>\n<p>The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the</p>\n<p>ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This</p>\n<p>circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made</p>\n<p>me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years</p>\n<p>spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the</p>",
        "<p>groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to</p>\n<p>the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be</p>\n<p>necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness</p>\n<p>of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt</p>\n<p>myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard</p>\n<p>of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the</p>\n<p>happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved</p>",
        "<p>a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable</p>\n<p>sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw</p>\n<p>his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in</p>\n<p>tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,</p>\n<p>confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,</p>\n<p>and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend</p>\n<p>reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,</p>",
        "<p>instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his</p>\n<p>money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he</p>\n<p>bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his</p>\n<p>prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young</p>\n<p>woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old</p>\n<p>man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,</p>\n<p>when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned</p>",
        "<p>until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her</p>\n<p>inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is</p>\n<p>so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind</p>\n<p>of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct</p>\n<p>the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which</p>\n<p>otherwise he would command.</p>\n<p>Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can</p>",
        "<p>conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am</p>\n<p>wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage</p>\n<p>is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The</p>\n<p>winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it</p>\n<p>is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail</p>\n<p>sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me</p>\n<p>sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the</p>",
        "<p>safety of others is committed to my care.</p>\n<p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my</p>\n<p>undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of</p>\n<p>the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which</p>\n<p>I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the</p>\n<p>land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not</p>\n<p>be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and</p>",
        "<p>woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I</p>\n<p>will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my</p>\n<p>passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that</p>\n<p>production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something</p>\n<p>at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically</p>\n<p>industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and</p>\n<p>labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief</p>",
        "<p>in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out</p>\n<p>of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited</p>\n<p>regions I am about to explore.</p>\n<p>But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after</p>\n<p>having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of</p>\n<p>Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to</p>\n<p>look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to</p>",
        "<p>me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when</p>\n<p>I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.</p>\n<p>Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.</p>\n<p>Your affectionate brother,</p>\n<p>Robert Walton</p>",
        "<h3>Letter 3</h3>\n<p>_To Mrs. Saville, England._</p>\n<p>July 7th, 17—.</p>\n<p>My dear Sister,</p>\n<p>I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced</p>\n<p>on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on</p>\n<p>its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not</p>",
        "<p>see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good</p>\n<p>spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the</p>\n<p>floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers</p>\n<p>of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We</p>\n<p>have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of</p>\n<p>summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,</p>\n<p>which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire</p>",
        "<p>to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not</p>\n<p>expected.</p>\n<p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a</p>\n<p>letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are</p>\n<p>accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and</p>\n<p>I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.</p>\n<p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as</p>",
        "<p>yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,</p>\n<p>persevering, and prudent.</p>\n<p>But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I</p>\n<p>have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars</p>\n<p>themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not</p>\n<p>still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the</p>\n<p>determined heart and resolved will of man?</p>",
        "<p>My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must</p>\n<p>finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!</p>\n<p>R.W.</p>",
        "<h3>Letter 4</h3>\n<p>_To Mrs. Saville, England._</p>\n<p>August 5th, 17—.</p>\n<p>So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear</p>\n<p>recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before</p>\n<p>these papers can come into your possession.</p>\n<p>Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed</p>",
        "<p>in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which</p>\n<p>she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we</p>\n<p>were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,</p>\n<p>hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.</p>\n<p>About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out</p>\n<p>in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to</p>\n<p>have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to</p>",
        "<p>grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly</p>\n<p>attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own</p>\n<p>situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by</p>\n<p>dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a</p>\n<p>being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,</p>\n<p>sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress</p>\n<p>of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the</p>",
        "<p>distant inequalities of the ice.</p>\n<p>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,</p>\n<p>many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that</p>\n<p>it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by</p>\n<p>ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the</p>\n<p>greatest attention.</p>\n<p>About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before</p>",
        "<p>night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the</p>\n<p>morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which</p>\n<p>float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to</p>\n<p>rest for a few hours.</p>\n<p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and</p>\n<p>found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently</p>\n<p>talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we</p>",
        "<p>had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large</p>\n<p>fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human</p>\n<p>being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.</p>\n<p>He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of</p>\n<p>some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the</p>\n<p>master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish</p>\n<p>on the open sea.”</p>",
        "<p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a</p>\n<p>foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,</p>\n<p>“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”</p>\n<p>You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed</p>\n<p>to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have</p>\n<p>supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not</p>\n<p>have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I</p>",
        "<p>replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the</p>\n<p>northern pole.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.</p>\n<p>Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for</p>\n<p>his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were</p>\n<p>nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and</p>\n<p>suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted</p>",
        "<p>to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh</p>\n<p>air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and</p>\n<p>restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to</p>\n<p>swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we</p>\n<p>wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the</p>\n<p>kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,</p>\n<p>which restored him wonderfully.</p>",
        "<p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often</p>\n<p>feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he</p>\n<p>had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and</p>\n<p>attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more</p>\n<p>interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of</p>\n<p>wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone</p>\n<p>performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most</p>",
        "<p>trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with</p>\n<p>a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he</p>\n<p>is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his</p>\n<p>teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>\n<p>When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off</p>\n<p>the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not</p>\n<p>allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body</p>",
        "<p>and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.</p>\n<p>Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice</p>\n<p>in so strange a vehicle.</p>\n<p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and</p>\n<p>he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”</p>\n<p>“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>",
        "<p>“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we</p>\n<p>saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”</p>\n<p>This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of</p>\n<p>questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had</p>\n<p>pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,</p>\n<p>doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good</p>\n<p>people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”</p>",
        "<p>“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to</p>\n<p>trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”</p>\n<p>“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have</p>\n<p>benevolently restored me to life.”</p>\n<p>Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the</p>\n<p>ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer</p>\n<p>with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near</p>",
        "<p>midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety</p>\n<p>before that time; but of this I could not judge.</p>\n<p>From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the</p>\n<p>stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for</p>\n<p>the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in</p>\n<p>the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant</p>",
        "<p>notice if any new object should appear in sight.</p>\n<p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the</p>\n<p>present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very</p>\n<p>silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.</p>\n<p>Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all</p>\n<p>interested in him, although they have had very little communication</p>\n<p>with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his</p>",
        "<p>constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must</p>\n<p>have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck</p>\n<p>so attractive and amiable.</p>\n<p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend</p>\n<p>on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been</p>\n<p>broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother</p>\n<p>of my heart.</p>",
        "<p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,</p>\n<p>should I have any fresh incidents to record.</p>\n<p>August 13th, 17—.</p>\n<p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my</p>\n<p>admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so</p>\n<p>noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant</p>\n<p>grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and</p>",
        "<p>when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,</p>\n<p>yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.</p>\n<p>He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,</p>\n<p>apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although</p>\n<p>unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he</p>\n<p>interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently</p>\n<p>conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without</p>",
        "<p>disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my</p>\n<p>eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken</p>\n<p>to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the</p>\n<p>language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul</p>\n<p>and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would</p>\n<p>sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my</p>\n<p>enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for</p>",
        "<p>the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should</p>\n<p>acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a</p>\n<p>dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I</p>\n<p>perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before</p>\n<p>his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle</p>\n<p>fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I</p>\n<p>paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you</p>",
        "<p>share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;</p>\n<p>let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”</p>\n<p>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the</p>\n<p>paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened</p>\n<p>powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were</p>\n<p>necessary to restore his composure.</p>\n<p>Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise</p>",
        "<p>himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of</p>\n<p>despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked</p>\n<p>me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it</p>\n<p>awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a</p>\n<p>friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than</p>\n<p>had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could</p>\n<p>boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.</p>",
        "<p>“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are</p>\n<p>unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than</p>\n<p>ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to</p>\n<p>perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most</p>\n<p>noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting</p>\n<p>friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for</p>\n<p>despair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life</p>",
        "<p>anew.”</p>\n<p>As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled</p>\n<p>grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently</p>\n<p>retired to his cabin.</p>\n<p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he</p>\n<p>does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight</p>\n<p>afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of</p>",
        "<p>elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he</p>\n<p>may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he</p>\n<p>has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a</p>\n<p>halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p>\n<p>Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine</p>\n<p>wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and</p>\n<p>refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore</p>",
        "<p>somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to</p>\n<p>appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I</p>\n<p>have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that</p>\n<p>elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I</p>\n<p>believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing</p>\n<p>power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled</p>\n<p>for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a</p>",
        "<p>voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.</p>\n<p>August 19th, 17—.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain</p>\n<p>Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had</p>\n<p>determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with</p>\n<p>me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for</p>\n<p>knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the</p>",
        "<p>gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine</p>\n<p>has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be</p>\n<p>useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same</p>\n<p>course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me</p>\n<p>what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one</p>\n<p>that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you</p>\n<p>in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually</p>",
        "<p>deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might</p>\n<p>fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things</p>\n<p>will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would</p>\n<p>provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers</p>\n<p>of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series</p>\n<p>internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”</p>\n<p>You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered</p>",
        "<p>communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by</p>\n<p>a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear</p>\n<p>the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong</p>\n<p>desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed</p>\n<p>these feelings in my answer.</p>\n<p>“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is</p>\n<p>useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I</p>",
        "<p>shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,</p>\n<p>perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my</p>\n<p>friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my</p>\n<p>destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is</p>\n<p>determined.”</p>\n<p>He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I</p>\n<p>should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have</p>",
        "<p>resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to</p>\n<p>record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during</p>\n<p>the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This</p>\n<p>manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who</p>\n<p>know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and</p>\n<p>sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my</p>\n<p>task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me</p>",
        "<p>with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in</p>\n<p>animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul</p>\n<p>within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which</p>\n<p>embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 1</h3>\n<p>I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most</p>\n<p>distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years</p>\n<p>counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public</p>\n<p>situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who</p>\n<p>knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public</p>\n<p>business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the</p>",
        "<p>affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his</p>\n<p>marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a</p>\n<p>husband and the father of a family.</p>\n<p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot</p>\n<p>refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a</p>\n<p>merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous</p>\n<p>mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a</p>",
        "<p>proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty</p>\n<p>and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been</p>\n<p>distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,</p>\n<p>therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his</p>\n<p>daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in</p>\n<p>wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and</p>\n<p>was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.</p>",
        "<p>He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct</p>\n<p>so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in</p>\n<p>endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin</p>\n<p>the world again through his credit and assistance.</p>\n<p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten</p>\n<p>months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,</p>\n<p>he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the</p>",
        "<p>Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort</p>\n<p>had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but</p>\n<p>it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in</p>\n<p>the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a</p>\n<p>merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;</p>\n<p>his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for</p>\n<p>reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end</p>",
        "<p>of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>\n<p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw</p>\n<p>with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that</p>\n<p>there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort</p>\n<p>possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support</p>\n<p>her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and</p>\n<p>by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to</p>",
        "<p>support life.</p>\n<p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time</p>\n<p>was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence</p>\n<p>decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving</p>\n<p>her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt</p>\n<p>by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the</p>\n<p>chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who</p>",
        "<p>committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he</p>\n<p>conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a</p>\n<p>relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.</p>\n<p>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but</p>\n<p>this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted</p>\n<p>affection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind</p>\n<p>which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love</p>",
        "<p>strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the</p>\n<p>late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set</p>\n<p>a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and</p>\n<p>worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the</p>\n<p>doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her</p>\n<p>virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing</p>\n<p>her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace</p>",
        "<p>to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes</p>\n<p>and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is</p>\n<p>sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her</p>\n<p>with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and</p>\n<p>benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto</p>\n<p>constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During</p>\n<p>the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had</p>",
        "<p>gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after</p>\n<p>their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change</p>\n<p>of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,</p>\n<p>as a restorative for her weakened frame.</p>\n<p>From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born</p>\n<p>at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained</p>\n<p>for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each</p>",
        "<p>other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very</p>\n<p>mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and</p>\n<p>my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my</p>\n<p>first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something</p>\n<p>better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on</p>\n<p>them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in</p>\n<p>their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled</p>",
        "<p>their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed</p>\n<p>towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit</p>\n<p>of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during</p>\n<p>every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,</p>\n<p>and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but</p>\n<p>one train of enjoyment to me.</p>\n<p>For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a</p>",
        "<p>daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five</p>\n<p>years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they</p>\n<p>passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent</p>\n<p>disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my</p>\n<p>mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a</p>\n<p>passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been</p>\n<p>relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the</p>",
        "<p>afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale</p>\n<p>attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number</p>\n<p>of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst</p>\n<p>shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,</p>\n<p>accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,</p>\n<p>hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to</p>\n<p>five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far</p>",
        "<p>above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were</p>\n<p>dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her</p>\n<p>hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her</p>\n<p>clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was</p>\n<p>clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of</p>\n<p>her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold</p>\n<p>her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,</p>",
        "<p>and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.</p>\n<p>The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and</p>\n<p>admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was</p>\n<p>not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a</p>\n<p>German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with</p>\n<p>these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been</p>\n<p>long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their</p>",
        "<p>charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory</p>\n<p>of Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted</p>\n<p>himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its</p>\n<p>weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria</p>\n<p>was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and</p>\n<p>a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude</p>\n<p>abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.</p>",
        "<p>When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of</p>\n<p>our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed</p>\n<p>to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter</p>\n<p>than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his</p>\n<p>permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their</p>\n<p>charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed</p>\n<p>a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty</p>",
        "<p>and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They</p>\n<p>consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza</p>\n<p>became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than</p>\n<p>sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and</p>\n<p>my pleasures.</p>\n<p>Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential</p>\n<p>attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my</p>",
        "<p>pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to</p>\n<p>my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my</p>\n<p>Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she</p>\n<p>presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish</p>\n<p>seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth</p>\n<p>as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on</p>\n<p>her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other</p>",
        "<p>familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body</p>\n<p>forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than</p>\n<p>sister, since till death she was to be mine only.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 2</h3>\n<p>We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in</p>\n<p>our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of</p>\n<p>disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and</p>\n<p>the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us</p>\n<p>nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated</p>\n<p>disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense</p>",
        "<p>application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p>She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;</p>\n<p>and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss</p>\n<p>home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,</p>\n<p>tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of</p>\n<p>our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.</p>\n<p>While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the</p>",
        "<p>magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their</p>\n<p>causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.</p>\n<p>Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,</p>\n<p>gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the</p>\n<p>earliest sensations I can remember.</p>\n<p>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave</p>\n<p>up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native</p>",
        "<p>country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,</p>\n<p>the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a</p>\n<p>league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the</p>\n<p>lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my</p>\n<p>temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was</p>\n<p>indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united</p>\n<p>myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry</p>",
        "<p>Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular</p>\n<p>talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for</p>\n<p>its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He</p>\n<p>composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and</p>\n<p>knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into</p>\n<p>masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of</p>\n<p>Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous</p>",
        "<p>train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands</p>\n<p>of the infidels.</p>\n<p>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My</p>\n<p>parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.</p>\n<p>We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to</p>\n<p>their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights</p>\n<p>which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly</p>",
        "<p>discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted</p>\n<p>the development of filial love.</p>\n<p>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some</p>\n<p>law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits</p>\n<p>but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things</p>\n<p>indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,</p>\n<p>nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states</p>",
        "<p>possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth</p>\n<p>that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of</p>\n<p>things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man</p>\n<p>that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,</p>\n<p>or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral</p>\n<p>relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,</p>",
        "<p>and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was</p>\n<p>to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the</p>\n<p>gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul</p>\n<p>of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.</p>\n<p>Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of</p>\n<p>her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was</p>\n<p>the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become</p>",
        "<p>sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that</p>\n<p>she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And</p>\n<p>Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet</p>\n<p>he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his</p>\n<p>generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for</p>\n<p>adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of</p>\n<p>beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring</p>",
        "<p>ambition.</p>\n<p>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,</p>\n<p>before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of</p>\n<p>extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,</p>\n<p>in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which</p>\n<p>led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would</p>\n<p>account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my</p>",
        "<p>destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost</p>\n<p>forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent</p>\n<p>which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.</p>\n<p>Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,</p>\n<p>therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my</p>\n<p>predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went</p>\n<p>on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the</p>",
        "<p>weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I</p>\n<p>chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it</p>\n<p>with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful</p>\n<p>facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new</p>\n<p>light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my</p>\n<p>discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my</p>\n<p>book and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste</p>",
        "<p>your time upon this; it is sad trash.”</p>\n<p>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me</p>\n<p>that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern</p>\n<p>system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers</p>\n<p>than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while</p>\n<p>those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I</p>\n<p>should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my</p>",
        "<p>imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my</p>\n<p>former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never</p>\n<p>have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance</p>\n<p>my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was</p>\n<p>acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest</p>\n<p>avidity.</p>\n<p>When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this</p>",
        "<p>author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and</p>\n<p>studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me</p>\n<p>treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always</p>\n<p>having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of</p>\n<p>nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern</p>\n<p>philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.</p>\n<p>Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking</p>",
        "<p>up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his</p>\n<p>successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted</p>\n<p>appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same</p>\n<p>pursuit.</p>\n<p>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted</p>\n<p>with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little</p>\n<p>more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal</p>",
        "<p>lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,</p>\n<p>anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes</p>\n<p>in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I</p>\n<p>had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep</p>\n<p>human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and</p>\n<p>ignorantly I had repined.</p>\n<p>But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew</p>",
        "<p>more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their</p>\n<p>disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth</p>\n<p>century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of</p>\n<p>Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite</p>\n<p>studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a</p>\n<p>child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p>Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest</p>",
        "<p>diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir</p>\n<p>of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an</p>\n<p>inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could</p>\n<p>banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but</p>\n<p>a violent death!</p>\n<p>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a</p>\n<p>promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which</p>",
        "<p>I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I</p>\n<p>attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a</p>\n<p>want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was</p>\n<p>occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand</p>\n<p>contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of</p>\n<p>multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish</p>\n<p>reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.</p>",
        "<p>When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near</p>\n<p>Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It</p>\n<p>advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once</p>\n<p>with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,</p>\n<p>while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.</p>\n<p>As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an</p>\n<p>old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so</p>",
        "<p>soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing</p>\n<p>remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found</p>\n<p>the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the</p>\n<p>shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld</p>\n<p>anything so utterly destroyed.</p>\n<p>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of</p>\n<p>electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural</p>",
        "<p>philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on</p>\n<p>the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of</p>\n<p>electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.</p>\n<p>All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,</p>\n<p>Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by</p>\n<p>some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my</p>\n<p>accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever</p>",
        "<p>be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew</p>\n<p>despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps</p>\n<p>most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former</p>\n<p>occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed</p>\n<p>and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a</p>\n<p>would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of</p>\n<p>real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the</p>",
        "<p>mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as</p>\n<p>being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.</p>\n<p>Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments</p>\n<p>are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me</p>\n<p>as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the</p>\n<p>immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort</p>\n<p>made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even</p>",
        "<p>then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was</p>\n<p>announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which</p>\n<p>followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting</p>\n<p>studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with</p>\n<p>their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.</p>\n<p>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.</p>\n<p>Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and</p>",
        "<p>terrible destruction.</p>",

        "<p>resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life</p>\n<p>occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was</p>\n<p>in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to</p>\n<p>persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first</p>\n<p>yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her</p>\n<p>favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She</p>",
        "<p>attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity</p>\n<p>of the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this</p>\n<p>imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother</p>\n<p>sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the</p>\n<p>looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her</p>\n<p>deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert</p>\n<p>her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My</p>",
        "<p>children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were</p>\n<p>placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the</p>\n<p>consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to</p>\n<p>my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy</p>\n<p>and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are</p>\n<p>not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to</p>\n<p>death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”</p>",
        "<p>She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.</p>\n<p>I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent</p>\n<p>by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the</p>\n<p>soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so</p>\n<p>long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day</p>\n<p>and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed</p>\n<p>for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been</p>",
        "<p>extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear</p>\n<p>can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of</p>\n<p>the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the</p>\n<p>evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has</p>\n<p>not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I</p>\n<p>describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at</p>\n<p>length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and</p>",
        "<p>the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a</p>\n<p>sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still</p>\n<p>duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the</p>\n<p>rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the</p>\n<p>spoiler has not seized.</p>\n<p>My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,</p>\n<p>was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of</p>",
        "<p>some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,</p>\n<p>akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of</p>\n<p>life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was</p>\n<p>unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above</p>\n<p>all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.</p>\n<p>She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.</p>\n<p>She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and</p>",
        "<p>zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call</p>\n<p>her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,</p>\n<p>when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.</p>\n<p>She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.</p>\n<p>The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last</p>\n<p>evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit</p>\n<p>him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His</p>",
        "<p>father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the</p>\n<p>aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune</p>\n<p>of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when</p>\n<p>he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a</p>\n<p>restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details</p>\n<p>of commerce.</p>\n<p>We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor</p>",
        "<p>persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we</p>\n<p>retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the</p>\n<p>other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the</p>\n<p>carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father</p>\n<p>again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to</p>\n<p>renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last</p>\n<p>feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.</p>",
        "<p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in</p>\n<p>the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by</p>\n<p>amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual</p>\n<p>pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I</p>\n<p>must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto</p>\n<p>been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible</p>\n<p>repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and</p>",
        "<p>Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself</p>\n<p>totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as</p>\n<p>I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I</p>\n<p>ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,</p>\n<p>thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had</p>\n<p>longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.</p>\n<p>Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to</p>",
        "<p>repent.</p>\n<p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my</p>\n<p>journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the</p>\n<p>high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was</p>\n<p>conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.</p>\n<p>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to</p>\n<p>some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil</p>",
        "<p>influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me</p>\n<p>from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s</p>\n<p>door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He</p>\n<p>was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He</p>\n<p>asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches</p>\n<p>of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and</p>\n<p>partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal</p>",
        "<p>authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he</p>\n<p>said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”</p>\n<p>I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with</p>\n<p>warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly</p>\n<p>and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems</p>\n<p>and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,</p>\n<p>where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you</p>",
        "<p>have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they</p>\n<p>are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific</p>\n<p>age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear</p>\n<p>sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”</p>\n<p>So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books</p>\n<p>treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and</p>\n<p>dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following</p>",
        "<p>week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural</p>\n<p>philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow</p>\n<p>professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he</p>\n<p>omitted.</p>\n<p>I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long</p>\n<p>considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I</p>\n<p>returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any</p>",
        "<p>shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a</p>\n<p>repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in</p>\n<p>favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a</p>\n<p>strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come</p>\n<p>to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been</p>\n<p>content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural</p>\n<p>science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my</p>",
        "<p>extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the</p>\n<p>steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the</p>\n<p>discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.</p>\n<p>Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.</p>\n<p>It was very different when the masters of the science sought</p>\n<p>immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now</p>\n<p>the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit</p>",
        "<p>itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in</p>\n<p>science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of</p>\n<p>boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.</p>\n<p>Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my</p>\n<p>residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming</p>\n<p>acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new</p>\n<p>abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information</p>",
        "<p>which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I</p>\n<p>could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver</p>\n<p>sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.</p>\n<p>Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.</p>\n<p>Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing</p>\n<p>room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very</p>\n<p>unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an</p>",
        "<p>aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his</p>\n<p>temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person</p>\n<p>was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.</p>\n<p>He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and</p>\n<p>the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing</p>\n<p>with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took</p>\n<p>a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of</p>",
        "<p>its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he</p>\n<p>concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I</p>\n<p>shall never forget:</p>\n<p>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,</p>\n<p>“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters</p>\n<p>promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that</p>\n<p>the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem</p>",
        "<p>only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or</p>\n<p>crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses</p>\n<p>of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the</p>\n<p>heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of</p>\n<p>the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;</p>\n<p>they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even</p>\n<p>mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”</p>",
        "<p>Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of</p>\n<p>the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul</p>\n<p>were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were</p>\n<p>touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was</p>\n<p>sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,</p>\n<p>one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of</p>\n<p>Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps</p>",
        "<p>already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and</p>\n<p>unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.</p>\n<p>I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of</p>\n<p>insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I</p>\n<p>had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,</p>\n<p>sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.</p>\n<p>There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to</p>",
        "<p>devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a</p>\n<p>natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His</p>\n<p>manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,</p>\n<p>for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in</p>\n<p>his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I</p>\n<p>gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had</p>\n<p>given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little</p>",
        "<p>narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius</p>\n<p>Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had</p>\n<p>exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal</p>\n<p>modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their</p>\n<p>knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names</p>\n<p>and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a</p>\n<p>great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The</p>",
        "<p>labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever</p>\n<p>fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I</p>\n<p>listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption</p>\n<p>or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my</p>\n<p>prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured</p>\n<p>terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his</p>\n<p>instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have</p>",
        "<p>made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended</p>\n<p>labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to</p>\n<p>procure.</p>\n<p>“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a</p>\n<p>disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of</p>\n<p>your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the</p>\n<p>greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that</p>",
        "<p>I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not</p>\n<p>neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry</p>\n<p>chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your</p>\n<p>wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty</p>\n<p>experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural</p>\n<p>philosophy, including mathematics.”</p>\n<p>He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his</p>",
        "<p>various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and</p>\n<p>promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in</p>\n<p>the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of</p>\n<p>books which I had requested, and I took my leave.</p>\n<p>Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 4</h3>\n<p>From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the</p>\n<p>most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.</p>\n<p>I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,</p>\n<p>which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the</p>\n<p>lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the</p>\n<p>university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense</p>",
        "<p>and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive</p>\n<p>physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In</p>\n<p>M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by</p>\n<p>dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and</p>\n<p>good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways</p>\n<p>he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse</p>\n<p>inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at</p>",
        "<p>first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and</p>\n<p>soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the</p>\n<p>light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>\n<p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress</p>\n<p>was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and</p>\n<p>my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,</p>\n<p>with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman</p>",
        "<p>expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years</p>\n<p>passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was</p>\n<p>engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I</p>\n<p>hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive</p>\n<p>of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as</p>\n<p>others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in</p>\n<p>a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.</p>",
        "<p>A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must</p>\n<p>infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who</p>\n<p>continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was</p>\n<p>solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two</p>\n<p>years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical</p>\n<p>instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the</p>\n<p>university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well</p>",
        "<p>acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as</p>\n<p>depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my</p>\n<p>residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought</p>\n<p>of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident</p>\n<p>happened that protracted my stay.</p>\n<p>One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was</p>\n<p>the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with</p>",
        "<p>life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?</p>\n<p>It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a</p>\n<p>mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming</p>\n<p>acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our</p>\n<p>inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined</p>\n<p>thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of</p>\n<p>natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been</p>",
        "<p>animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this</p>\n<p>study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the</p>\n<p>causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became</p>\n<p>acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I</p>\n<p>must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.</p>\n<p>In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my</p>\n<p>mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever</p>",
        "<p>remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared</p>\n<p>the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and</p>\n<p>a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of</p>\n<p>life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become</p>\n<p>food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of</p>\n<p>this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and</p>\n<p>charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most</p>",
        "<p>insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the</p>\n<p>fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of</p>\n<p>death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm</p>\n<p>inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and</p>\n<p>analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change</p>\n<p>from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this</p>\n<p>darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and</p>",
        "<p>wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity</p>\n<p>of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so</p>\n<p>many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same</p>\n<p>science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a</p>\n<p>secret.</p>\n<p>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not</p>\n<p>more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is</p>",
        "<p>true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the</p>\n<p>discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of</p>\n<p>incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of</p>\n<p>generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing</p>\n<p>animation upon lifeless matter.</p>\n<p>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery</p>\n<p>soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in</p>",
        "<p>painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the</p>\n<p>most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so</p>\n<p>great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been</p>\n<p>progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.</p>\n<p>What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation</p>\n<p>of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it</p>\n<p>all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a</p>",
        "<p>nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them</p>\n<p>towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already</p>\n<p>accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead</p>\n<p>and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly</p>\n<p>ineffectual light.</p>\n<p>I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes</p>\n<p>express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with</p>",
        "<p>which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end</p>\n<p>of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that</p>\n<p>subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,</p>\n<p>to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my</p>\n<p>precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of</p>\n<p>knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town</p>\n<p>to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature</p>",
        "<p>will allow.</p>\n<p>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated</p>\n<p>a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.</p>\n<p>Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to</p>\n<p>prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of</p>\n<p>fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable</p>\n<p>difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the</p>",
        "<p>creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my</p>\n<p>imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to</p>\n<p>doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful</p>\n<p>as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared</p>\n<p>adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should</p>\n<p>ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my</p>\n<p>operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be</p>",
        "<p>imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes</p>\n<p>place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present</p>\n<p>attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor</p>\n<p>could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any</p>\n<p>argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I</p>\n<p>began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts</p>\n<p>formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first</p>",
        "<p>intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,</p>\n<p>about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having</p>\n<p>formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully</p>\n<p>collecting and arranging my materials, I began.</p>\n<p>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like</p>\n<p>a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death</p>\n<p>appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and</p>",
        "<p>pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless</p>\n<p>me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would</p>\n<p>owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his</p>\n<p>child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these</p>\n<p>reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless</p>\n<p>matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)</p>\n<p>renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.</p>",
        "<p>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking</p>\n<p>with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my</p>\n<p>person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very</p>\n<p>brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the</p>\n<p>next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone</p>\n<p>possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon</p>\n<p>gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless</p>",
        "<p>eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive</p>\n<p>the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps</p>\n<p>of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless</p>\n<p>clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but</p>\n<p>then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed</p>\n<p>to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was</p>\n<p>indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed</p>",
        "<p>acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had</p>\n<p>returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and</p>\n<p>disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human</p>\n<p>frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,</p>\n<p>and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,</p>\n<p>I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from</p>\n<p>their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The</p>",
        "<p>dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;</p>\n<p>and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,</p>\n<p>whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I</p>\n<p>brought my work near to a conclusion.</p>\n<p>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in</p>\n<p>one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields</p>\n<p>bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant</p>",
        "<p>vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the</p>\n<p>same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also</p>\n<p>to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had</p>\n<p>not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I</p>\n<p>well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are</p>\n<p>pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall</p>\n<p>hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any</p>",
        "<p>interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties</p>\n<p>are equally neglected.”</p>\n<p>I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could</p>\n<p>not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which</p>\n<p>had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it</p>\n<p>were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection</p>\n<p>until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,</p>",
        "<p>should be completed.</p>\n<p>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect</p>\n<p>to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was</p>\n<p>justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from</p>\n<p>blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and</p>\n<p>peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to</p>\n<p>disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge</p>",
        "<p>is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself</p>\n<p>has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for</p>\n<p>those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that</p>\n<p>study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human</p>\n<p>mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit</p>\n<p>whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic</p>\n<p>affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his</p>",
        "<p>country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the</p>\n<p>empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.</p>\n<p>But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my</p>\n<p>tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.</p>\n<p>My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my</p>\n<p>silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.</p>\n<p>Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not</p>",
        "<p>watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always</p>\n<p>yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my</p>\n<p>occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near</p>\n<p>to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had</p>\n<p>succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared</p>\n<p>rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other</p>\n<p>unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.</p>",
        "<p>Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most</p>\n<p>painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow</p>\n<p>creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at</p>\n<p>the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone</p>\n<p>sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and</p>\n<p>amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself</p>\n<p>both of these when my creation should be complete.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 5</h3>\n<p>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment</p>\n<p>of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I</p>\n<p>collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a</p>\n<p>spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was</p>\n<p>already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the</p>\n<p>panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the</p>",
        "<p>half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature</p>\n<p>open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p>\n<p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate</p>\n<p>the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to</p>\n<p>form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as</p>\n<p>beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered</p>\n<p>the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous</p>",
        "<p>black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these</p>\n<p>luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,</p>\n<p>that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which</p>\n<p>they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.</p>\n<p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings</p>\n<p>of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole</p>\n<p>purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had</p>",
        "<p>deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour</p>\n<p>that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty</p>\n<p>of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my</p>\n<p>heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I</p>\n<p>rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my</p>\n<p>bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude</p>\n<p>succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the</p>",
        "<p>bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.</p>\n<p>But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest</p>\n<p>dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in</p>\n<p>the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,</p>\n<p>but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with</p>\n<p>the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I</p>\n<p>held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her</p>",
        "<p>form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.</p>\n<p>I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my</p>\n<p>teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and</p>\n<p>yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window</p>\n<p>shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had</p>\n<p>created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they</p>\n<p>may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some</p>",
        "<p>inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have</p>\n<p>spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to</p>\n<p>detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the</p>\n<p>courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained</p>\n<p>during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest</p>\n<p>agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if</p>\n<p>it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I</p>",
        "<p>had so miserably given life.</p>\n<p>Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy</p>\n<p>again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I</p>\n<p>had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those</p>\n<p>muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing</p>\n<p>such as even Dante could not have conceived.</p>\n<p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and</p>",
        "<p>hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly</p>\n<p>sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with</p>\n<p>this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had</p>\n<p>been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a</p>\n<p>hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!</p>\n<p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my</p>\n<p>sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple</p>",
        "<p>and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates</p>\n<p>of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into</p>\n<p>the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the</p>\n<p>wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my</p>\n<p>view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but</p>\n<p>felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured</p>\n<p>from a black and comfortless sky.</p>",
        "<p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by</p>\n<p>bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I</p>\n<p>traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or</p>\n<p>what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I</p>\n<p>hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:</p>\n<p>Like one who, on a lonely road,</p>\n<p>Doth walk in fear and dread,</p>",
        "<p>And, having once turned round, walks on,</p>\n<p>And turns no more his head;</p>\n<p>Because he knows a frightful fiend</p>\n<p>Doth close behind him tread.</p>\n<p>[Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]</p>\n<p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various</p>\n<p>diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;</p>",
        "<p>but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming</p>\n<p>towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed</p>\n<p>that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and</p>\n<p>on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,</p>\n<p>instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,</p>\n<p>“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at</p>\n<p>the very moment of my alighting!”</p>",
        "<p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back</p>\n<p>to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear</p>\n<p>to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror</p>\n<p>and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,</p>\n<p>calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial</p>\n<p>manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for</p>\n<p>some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being</p>",
        "<p>permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said</p>\n<p>he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all</p>\n<p>necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;</p>\n<p>and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant</p>\n<p>answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch</p>\n<p>schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins</p>\n<p>a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his</p>",
        "<p>affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has</p>\n<p>permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of</p>\n<p>knowledge.”</p>\n<p>“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left</p>\n<p>my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”</p>\n<p>“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from</p>\n<p>you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their</p>",
        "<p>account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping</p>\n<p>short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill</p>\n<p>you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for</p>\n<p>several nights.”</p>\n<p>“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one</p>\n<p>occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;</p>\n<p>but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an</p>",
        "<p>end and that I am at length free.”</p>\n<p>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to</p>\n<p>allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a</p>\n<p>quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and</p>\n<p>the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my</p>\n<p>apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to</p>\n<p>behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.</p>",
        "<p>Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the</p>\n<p>stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the</p>\n<p>lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a</p>\n<p>cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as</p>\n<p>children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in</p>\n<p>waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped</p>\n<p>fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed</p>",
        "<p>from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good</p>\n<p>fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy</p>\n<p>had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.</p>\n<p>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;</p>\n<p>but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed</p>\n<p>me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse</p>\n<p>beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same</p>",
        "<p>place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.</p>\n<p>Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,</p>\n<p>but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes</p>\n<p>for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless</p>\n<p>laughter frightened and astonished him.</p>\n<p>“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,</p>\n<p>is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the</p>",
        "<p>cause of all this?”</p>\n<p>“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I</p>\n<p>thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can</p>\n<p>tell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;</p>\n<p>I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.</p>\n<p>Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he</p>\n<p>anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I</p>",
        "<p>was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not</p>\n<p>recover my senses for a long, long time.</p>\n<p>This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for</p>\n<p>several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I</p>\n<p>afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness</p>\n<p>for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my</p>",
        "<p>disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive</p>\n<p>nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he</p>\n<p>did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest</p>\n<p>action that he could towards them.</p>\n<p>But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and</p>\n<p>unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.</p>\n<p>The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever</p>",
        "<p>before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my</p>\n<p>words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings</p>\n<p>of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I</p>\n<p>continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder</p>\n<p>indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.</p>\n<p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and</p>\n<p>grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became</p>",
        "<p>capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I</p>\n<p>perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young</p>\n<p>buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was</p>\n<p>a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my</p>\n<p>convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in</p>\n<p>my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as</p>\n<p>cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.</p>",
        "<p>“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good</p>\n<p>you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you</p>\n<p>promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever</p>\n<p>repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I</p>\n<p>have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”</p>\n<p>“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get</p>\n<p>well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I</p>",
        "<p>may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”</p>\n<p>I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on</p>\n<p>whom I dared not even think?</p>\n<p>“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of</p>\n<p>colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father</p>\n<p>and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your</p>\n<p>own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at</p>",
        "<p>your long silence.”</p>\n<p>“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first</p>\n<p>thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and</p>\n<p>who are so deserving of my love?”</p>\n<p>“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad</p>\n<p>to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from</p>\n<p>your cousin, I believe.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 6</h3>\n<p>Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my</p>\n<p>own Elizabeth:</p>\n<p>“My dearest Cousin,</p>\n<p>“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear</p>\n<p>kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are</p>\n<p>forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,</p>",
        "<p>is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought</p>\n<p>that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have</p>\n<p>restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have</p>\n<p>prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so</p>\n<p>long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to</p>\n<p>perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on</p>\n<p>your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never</p>",
        "<p>guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of</p>\n<p>your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed</p>\n<p>you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this</p>\n<p>intelligence soon in your own handwriting.</p>\n<p>“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and</p>\n<p>friends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he</p>\n<p>asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a</p>",
        "<p>care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would</p>\n<p>be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full</p>\n<p>of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter</p>\n<p>into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his</p>\n<p>elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of</p>\n<p>a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your</p>\n<p>powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his</p>",
        "<p>time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the</p>\n<p>lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point</p>\n<p>and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.</p>\n<p>“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken</p>\n<p>place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they</p>\n<p>never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are</p>\n<p>regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up</p>",
        "<p>my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing</p>\n<p>none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one</p>\n<p>change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on</p>\n<p>what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;</p>\n<p>I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,</p>\n<p>her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the</p>\n<p>third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but</p>",
        "<p>through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and</p>\n<p>after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed</p>\n<p>this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother</p>\n<p>to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our</p>\n<p>country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which</p>\n<p>prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less</p>\n<p>distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the</p>",
        "<p>lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are</p>\n<p>more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same</p>\n<p>thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in</p>\n<p>our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our</p>\n<p>fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a</p>\n<p>sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.</p>\n<p>“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I</p>",
        "<p>recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one</p>\n<p>glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that</p>\n<p>Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so</p>\n<p>frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,</p>\n<p>by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that</p>\n<p>which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;</p>\n<p>Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not</p>",
        "<p>mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but</p>\n<p>you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.</p>\n<p>Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,</p>\n<p>yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She</p>\n<p>thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her</p>\n<p>phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.</p>\n<p>“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own</p>",
        "<p>grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness</p>\n<p>with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other</p>\n<p>trials were reserved for her.</p>\n<p>“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the</p>\n<p>exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The</p>\n<p>conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the</p>\n<p>deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her</p>",
        "<p>partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor</p>\n<p>confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months</p>\n<p>after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her</p>\n<p>repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she</p>\n<p>was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness</p>\n<p>and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable</p>\n<p>for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature</p>",
        "<p>to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her</p>\n<p>repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,</p>\n<p>but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her</p>\n<p>brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz</p>\n<p>into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is</p>\n<p>now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,</p>\n<p>at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;</p>",
        "<p>and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,</p>\n<p>and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her</p>\n<p>expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.</p>\n<p>“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling</p>\n<p>William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with</p>\n<p>sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he</p>\n<p>smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with</p>",
        "<p>health. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron</p>\n<p>is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.</p>\n<p>“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little</p>\n<p>gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield</p>\n<p>has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching</p>\n<p>marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly</p>\n<p>sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your</p>",
        "<p>favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes</p>\n<p>since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already</p>\n<p>recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a</p>\n<p>lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much</p>\n<p>older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with</p>\n<p>everybody.</p>\n<p>“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety</p>",
        "<p>returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one</p>\n<p>word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his</p>\n<p>kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely</p>\n<p>grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat</p>\n<p>you, write!</p>\n<p>“Elizabeth Lavenza.</p>\n<p>“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”</p>",
        "<p>“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her</p>\n<p>letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety</p>\n<p>they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but</p>\n<p>my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another</p>\n<p>fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.</p>\n<p>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the</p>\n<p>several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a</p>",
        "<p>kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had</p>\n<p>sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the</p>\n<p>beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even</p>\n<p>to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored</p>\n<p>to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony</p>\n<p>of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my</p>\n<p>apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he</p>",
        "<p>perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had</p>\n<p>previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of</p>\n<p>no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture</p>\n<p>when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I</p>\n<p>had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the</p>\n<p>subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to</p>\n<p>modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science</p>",
        "<p>itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What</p>\n<p>could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he</p>\n<p>had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which</p>\n<p>were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I</p>\n<p>writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.</p>\n<p>Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the</p>\n<p>sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his</p>",
        "<p>total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I</p>\n<p>thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly</p>\n<p>that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from</p>\n<p>me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence</p>\n<p>that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in</p>\n<p>him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which</p>\n<p>I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.</p>",
        "<p>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of</p>\n<p>almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even</p>\n<p>more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n</p>\n<p>the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has</p>\n<p>outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A</p>\n<p>youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly</p>\n<p>as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if</p>",
        "<p>he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,</p>\n<p>ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,</p>\n<p>“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.</p>\n<p>Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was</p>\n<p>myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”</p>\n<p>M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned</p>\n<p>the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.</p>",
        "<p>Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his</p>\n<p>literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He</p>\n<p>came to the university with the design of making himself complete</p>\n<p>master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for</p>\n<p>the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no</p>\n<p>inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording</p>\n<p>scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit</p>",
        "<p>languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on</p>\n<p>the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I</p>\n<p>wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt</p>\n<p>great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not</p>\n<p>only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I</p>\n<p>did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for</p>\n<p>I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary</p>",
        "<p>amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well</p>\n<p>repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy</p>\n<p>elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of</p>\n<p>any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to</p>\n<p>consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns</p>\n<p>of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How</p>\n<p>different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!</p>",
        "<p>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was</p>\n<p>fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several</p>\n<p>accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,</p>\n<p>and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this</p>\n<p>delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved</p>\n<p>friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an</p>\n<p>unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become</p>",
        "<p>acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent</p>\n<p>cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came</p>\n<p>its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.</p>\n<p>The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily</p>\n<p>which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a</p>\n<p>pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a</p>\n<p>personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded</p>",
        "<p>with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval</p>\n<p>had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature</p>\n<p>that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.</p>\n<p>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits</p>\n<p>had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the</p>\n<p>salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and</p>\n<p>the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the</p>",
        "<p>intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but</p>\n<p>Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught</p>\n<p>me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.</p>\n<p>Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to</p>\n<p>elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish</p>\n<p>pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and</p>\n<p>affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature</p>",
        "<p>who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.</p>\n<p>When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most</p>\n<p>delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with</p>\n<p>ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring</p>\n<p>bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I</p>\n<p>was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed</p>\n<p>upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an</p>",
        "<p>invincible burden.</p>\n<p>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he</p>\n<p>exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled</p>\n<p>his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly</p>\n<p>astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in</p>\n<p>imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful</p>\n<p>fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew</p>",
        "<p>me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.</p>\n<p>We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were</p>\n<p>dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were</p>\n<p>high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 7</h3>\n<p>On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—</p>\n<p>“My dear Victor,</p>\n<p>“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of</p>\n<p>your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few</p>\n<p>lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But</p>\n<p>that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be</p>",
        "<p>your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to</p>\n<p>behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can</p>\n<p>I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to</p>\n<p>our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent</p>\n<p>son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is</p>\n<p>impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words</p>\n<p>which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.</p>",
        "<p>“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed</p>\n<p>my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!</p>\n<p>“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the</p>\n<p>circumstances of the transaction.</p>\n<p>“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to</p>\n<p>walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged</p>\n<p>our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of</p>",
        "<p>returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone</p>\n<p>on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until</p>\n<p>they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen</p>\n<p>his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William</p>\n<p>had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and</p>\n<p>afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.</p>\n<p>“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him</p>",
        "<p>until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have</p>\n<p>returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with</p>\n<p>torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had</p>\n<p>lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;</p>\n<p>Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I</p>\n<p>discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and</p>\n<p>active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the</p>",
        "<p>print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.</p>\n<p>“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my</p>\n<p>countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to</p>\n<p>see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,</p>\n<p>and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the</p>\n<p>victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my</p>\n<p>darling child!’</p>",
        "<p>“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again</p>\n<p>lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same</p>\n<p>evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable</p>\n<p>miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and</p>\n<p>was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We</p>\n<p>have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him</p>\n<p>are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!</p>",
        "<p>“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps</p>\n<p>continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;</p>\n<p>her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an</p>\n<p>additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?</p>\n<p>Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live</p>\n<p>to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!</p>\n<p>“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,</p>",
        "<p>but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of</p>\n<p>festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my</p>\n<p>friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not</p>\n<p>with hatred for your enemies.</p>\n<p>“Your affectionate and afflicted father,</p>\n<p>“Alphonse Frankenstein.</p>\n<p>“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”</p>",
        "<p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was</p>\n<p>surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first</p>\n<p>expressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the</p>\n<p>table, and covered my face with my hands.</p>\n<p>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me</p>\n<p>weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,</p>\n<p>what has happened?”</p>",
        "<p>I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the</p>\n<p>room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of</p>\n<p>Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.</p>\n<p>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;</p>\n<p>“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”</p>\n<p>“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”</p>\n<p>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;</p>",
        "<p>he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,</p>\n<p>“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had</p>\n<p>seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his</p>\n<p>untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How</p>\n<p>much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little</p>\n<p>fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but</p>\n<p>he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.</p>",
        "<p>A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer</p>\n<p>be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable</p>\n<p>survivors.”</p>\n<p>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words</p>\n<p>impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in</p>\n<p>solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a</p>\n<p>cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.</p>",
        "<p>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed</p>\n<p>to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I</p>\n<p>drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain</p>\n<p>the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through</p>\n<p>scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.</p>\n<p>How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and</p>\n<p>desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances</p>",
        "<p>might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were</p>\n<p>done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I</p>\n<p>dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,</p>\n<p>although I was unable to define them.</p>\n<p>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I</p>\n<p>contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the</p>\n<p>snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By</p>",
        "<p>degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey</p>\n<p>towards Geneva.</p>\n<p>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I</p>\n<p>approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black</p>\n<p>sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a</p>\n<p>child. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your</p>\n<p>wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and</p>",
        "<p>placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”</p>\n<p>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on</p>\n<p>these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative</p>\n<p>happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved</p>\n<p>country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again</p>\n<p>beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely</p>\n<p>lake!</p>",
        "<p>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also</p>\n<p>closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still</p>\n<p>more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I</p>\n<p>foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human</p>\n<p>beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single</p>\n<p>circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not</p>\n<p>conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.</p>",
        "<p>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates</p>\n<p>of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at</p>\n<p>Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky</p>\n<p>was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot</p>\n<p>where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the</p>\n<p>town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.</p>\n<p>During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont</p>",
        "<p>Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach</p>\n<p>rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its</p>\n<p>progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain</p>\n<p>coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</p>\n<p>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm</p>\n<p>increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash</p>\n<p>over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of</p>",
        "<p>Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the</p>\n<p>lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant</p>\n<p>every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself</p>\n<p>from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in</p>\n<p>Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The</p>\n<p>most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the</p>\n<p>lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of</p>",
        "<p>Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another</p>\n<p>darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the</p>\n<p>east of the lake.</p>\n<p>While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with</p>\n<p>a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my</p>\n<p>hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy</p>\n<p>funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the</p>",
        "<p>gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood</p>\n<p>fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning</p>\n<p>illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its</p>\n<p>gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs</p>\n<p>to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy</p>\n<p>dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I</p>\n<p>shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that</p>",
        "<p>idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth</p>\n<p>chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure</p>\n<p>passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could</p>\n<p>have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not</p>\n<p>doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the</p>\n<p>fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for</p>\n<p>another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly</p>",
        "<p>perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the</p>\n<p>south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>\n<p>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still</p>\n<p>continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I</p>\n<p>revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:</p>\n<p>the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of</p>\n<p>the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had</p>",
        "<p>now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and</p>\n<p>was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a</p>\n<p>depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not</p>\n<p>murdered my brother?</p>\n<p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the</p>\n<p>night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not</p>\n<p>feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in</p>",
        "<p>scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast</p>\n<p>among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes</p>\n<p>of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light</p>\n<p>of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced</p>\n<p>to destroy all that was dear to me.</p>\n<p>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were</p>\n<p>open, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to</p>",
        "<p>discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be</p>\n<p>made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A</p>\n<p>being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at</p>\n<p>midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I</p>\n<p>remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at</p>\n<p>the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of</p>\n<p>delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that</p>",
        "<p>if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have</p>\n<p>looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature</p>\n<p>of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited</p>\n<p>as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would</p>\n<p>be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the</p>\n<p>overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and</p>\n<p>I resolved to remain silent.</p>",
        "<p>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I</p>\n<p>told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library</p>\n<p>to attend their usual hour of rising.</p>\n<p>Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I</p>\n<p>stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my</p>\n<p>departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained</p>\n<p>to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the</p>",
        "<p>mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s</p>\n<p>desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling</p>\n<p>by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;</p>\n<p>but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the</p>\n<p>sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my</p>\n<p>tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest</p>\n<p>entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:</p>",
        "<p>“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you</p>\n<p>had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and</p>\n<p>delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can</p>\n<p>alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems</p>\n<p>sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor</p>\n<p>Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor</p>\n<p>William! he was our darling and our pride!”</p>",
        "<p>Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal</p>\n<p>agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the</p>\n<p>wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and</p>\n<p>a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more</p>\n<p>minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.</p>\n<p>“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused</p>\n<p>herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her</p>",
        "<p>very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”</p>\n<p>“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt</p>\n<p>to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the</p>\n<p>winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he</p>\n<p>was free last night!”</p>\n<p>“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of</p>\n<p>wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No</p>",
        "<p>one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be</p>\n<p>convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit</p>\n<p>that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,</p>\n<p>could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”</p>\n<p>“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is</p>\n<p>wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”</p>\n<p>“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have</p>",
        "<p>almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so</p>\n<p>confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,</p>\n<p>leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will</p>\n<p>then hear all.”</p>\n<p>He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William</p>\n<p>had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her</p>\n<p>bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,</p>",
        "<p>happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the</p>\n<p>murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which</p>\n<p>had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant</p>\n<p>instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to</p>\n<p>any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,</p>\n<p>Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl</p>\n<p>confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of</p>",
        "<p>manner.</p>\n<p>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied</p>\n<p>earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,</p>\n<p>good Justine, is innocent.”</p>\n<p>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed</p>\n<p>on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,</p>\n<p>after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced</p>",
        "<p>some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,</p>\n<p>“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of</p>\n<p>poor William.”</p>\n<p>“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had</p>\n<p>rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much</p>\n<p>depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”</p>\n<p>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”</p>",
        "<p>“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be</p>\n<p>tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”</p>\n<p>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that</p>\n<p>Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I</p>\n<p>had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be</p>\n<p>brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to</p>\n<p>announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as</p>",
        "<p>madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the</p>\n<p>creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the</p>\n<p>existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance</p>\n<p>which I had let loose upon the world?</p>\n<p>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last</p>\n<p>beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of</p>\n<p>her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but</p>",
        "<p>it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.</p>\n<p>She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear</p>\n<p>cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some</p>\n<p>means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she</p>\n<p>be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do</p>\n<p>upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only</p>\n<p>lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely</p>",
        "<p>love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I</p>\n<p>never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;</p>\n<p>and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little</p>\n<p>William.”</p>\n<p>“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall</p>\n<p>be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance</p>\n<p>of her acquittal.”</p>",
        "<p>“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,</p>\n<p>and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to</p>\n<p>see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me</p>\n<p>hopeless and despairing.” She wept.</p>\n<p>“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she</p>\n<p>is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the</p>\n<p>activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of</p>",
        "<p>partiality.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 8</h3>\n<p>We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to</p>\n<p>commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend</p>\n<p>as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of</p>\n<p>this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to</p>\n<p>be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would</p>\n<p>cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of</p>",
        "<p>innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every</p>\n<p>aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.</p>\n<p>Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised</p>\n<p>to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an</p>\n<p>ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I</p>\n<p>have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I</p>\n<p>was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have</p>",
        "<p>been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have</p>\n<p>exculpated her who suffered through me.</p>\n<p>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and</p>\n<p>her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her</p>\n<p>feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in</p>\n<p>innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by</p>\n<p>thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have</p>",
        "<p>excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the</p>\n<p>imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She</p>\n<p>was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as</p>\n<p>her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she</p>\n<p>worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the</p>\n<p>court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were</p>\n<p>seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly</p>",
        "<p>recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest</p>\n<p>her utter guiltlessness.</p>\n<p>The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the</p>\n<p>charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined</p>\n<p>against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof</p>\n<p>of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on</p>\n<p>which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been</p>",
        "<p>perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the</p>\n<p>murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she</p>\n<p>did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused</p>\n<p>and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight</p>\n<p>o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she</p>\n<p>replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly</p>\n<p>if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she</p>",
        "<p>fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The</p>\n<p>picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;</p>\n<p>and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same</p>\n<p>which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round</p>\n<p>his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.</p>\n<p>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her</p>\n<p>countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly</p>",
        "<p>expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was</p>\n<p>desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible</p>\n<p>although variable voice.</p>\n<p>“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I</p>\n<p>do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence</p>\n<p>on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced</p>\n<p>against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my</p>",
        "<p>judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears</p>\n<p>doubtful or suspicious.”</p>\n<p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed</p>\n<p>the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the</p>\n<p>house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from</p>\n<p>Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked</p>\n<p>her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was</p>",
        "<p>alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,</p>\n<p>when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain</p>\n<p>several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being</p>\n<p>unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most</p>\n<p>of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that</p>\n<p>she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.</p>\n<p>It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour</p>",
        "<p>to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,</p>\n<p>it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when</p>\n<p>questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed</p>\n<p>a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.</p>\n<p>Concerning the picture she could give no account.</p>\n<p>“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and</p>\n<p>fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of</p>",
        "<p>explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left</p>\n<p>to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been</p>\n<p>placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no</p>\n<p>enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me</p>\n<p>wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity</p>\n<p>afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the</p>\n<p>jewel, to part with it again so soon?</p>",
        "<p>“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for</p>\n<p>hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my</p>\n<p>character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed</p>\n<p>guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my</p>\n<p>innocence.”</p>\n<p>Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and</p>\n<p>they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they</p>",
        "<p>supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come</p>\n<p>forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent</p>\n<p>dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,</p>\n<p>when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address</p>\n<p>the court.</p>\n<p>“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who</p>\n<p>was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived</p>",
        "<p>with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may</p>\n<p>therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but</p>\n<p>when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her</p>\n<p>pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I</p>\n<p>know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived</p>\n<p>in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly</p>\n<p>two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and</p>",
        "<p>benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in</p>\n<p>her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards</p>\n<p>attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited</p>\n<p>the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my</p>\n<p>uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was</p>\n<p>warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a</p>\n<p>most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,</p>",
        "<p>notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely</p>\n<p>on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to</p>\n<p>the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,</p>\n<p>I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value</p>\n<p>her.”</p>\n<p>A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful</p>\n<p>appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in</p>",
        "<p>favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with</p>\n<p>renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She</p>\n<p>herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own</p>\n<p>agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed</p>\n<p>in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a</p>\n<p>minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have</p>\n<p>betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the</p>",
        "<p>horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and</p>\n<p>the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,</p>\n<p>I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did</p>\n<p>not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of</p>\n<p>remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.</p>\n<p>I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to</p>\n<p>the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal</p>",
        "<p>question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my</p>\n<p>visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine</p>\n<p>was condemned.</p>\n<p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before</p>\n<p>experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon</p>\n<p>them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the</p>\n<p>heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I</p>",
        "<p>addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.</p>\n<p>“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a</p>\n<p>case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to</p>\n<p>condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so</p>\n<p>decisive.”</p>\n<p>This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had</p>\n<p>my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would</p>",
        "<p>believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I</p>\n<p>hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.</p>\n<p>“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all</p>\n<p>judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty</p>\n<p>should escape. But she has confessed.”</p>\n<p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon</p>\n<p>Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I</p>",
        "<p>ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as</p>\n<p>my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?</p>\n<p>Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has</p>\n<p>committed a murder.”</p>\n<p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my</p>\n<p>cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own</p>\n<p>judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,</p>",
        "<p>“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany</p>\n<p>me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet</p>\n<p>I could not refuse.</p>\n<p>We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some</p>\n<p>straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on</p>\n<p>her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with</p>\n<p>her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My</p>",
        "<p>cousin wept also.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?</p>\n<p>I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I</p>\n<p>was not so miserable as I am now.”</p>\n<p>“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also</p>\n<p>join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her</p>\n<p>voice was suffocated with sobs.</p>",
        "<p>“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,</p>\n<p>if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you</p>\n<p>guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had</p>\n<p>yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be</p>\n<p>assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a</p>\n<p>moment, but your own confession.”</p>\n<p>“I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might</p>",
        "<p>obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than</p>\n<p>all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was</p>\n<p>condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,</p>\n<p>until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I</p>\n<p>was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if</p>\n<p>I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked</p>\n<p>on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?</p>",
        "<p>In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly</p>\n<p>miserable.”</p>\n<p>She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my</p>\n<p>sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed</p>\n<p>aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable</p>\n<p>of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.</p>\n<p>Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in</p>",
        "<p>heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I</p>\n<p>am to suffer ignominy and death.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.</p>\n<p>Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I</p>\n<p>will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony</p>\n<p>hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!</p>\n<p>You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!</p>",
        "<p>No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”</p>\n<p>Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said;</p>\n<p>“that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to</p>\n<p>endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember</p>\n<p>me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the</p>\n<p>fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to</p>\n<p>the will of heaven!”</p>",
        "<p>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,</p>\n<p>where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!</p>\n<p>Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass</p>\n<p>the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such</p>\n<p>deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,</p>\n<p>uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When</p>\n<p>she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very</p>",
        "<p>kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”</p>\n<p>I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more</p>\n<p>convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you</p>\n<p>had confessed, he did not credit it.”</p>\n<p>“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest</p>\n<p>gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is</p>\n<p>the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than</p>",
        "<p>half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my</p>\n<p>innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”</p>\n<p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed</p>\n<p>gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the</p>\n<p>never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or</p>\n<p>consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was</p>\n<p>the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair</p>",
        "<p>moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and</p>\n<p>despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within</p>\n<p>me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with</p>\n<p>Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear</p>\n<p>herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I</p>\n<p>cannot live in this world of misery.”</p>\n<p>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty</p>",
        "<p>repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice</p>\n<p>of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and</p>\n<p>preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever</p>\n<p>suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”</p>\n<p>And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence</p>\n<p>failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the</p>",
        "<p>criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant</p>\n<p>appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers</p>\n<p>and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed</p>\n<p>avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,</p>\n<p>but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She</p>\n<p>perished on the scaffold as a murderess!</p>\n<p>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and</p>",
        "<p>voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my</p>\n<p>father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was</p>\n<p>the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these</p>\n<p>are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and</p>\n<p>the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!</p>\n<p>Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he</p>\n<p>who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no</p>",
        "<p>thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear</p>\n<p>countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life</p>\n<p>in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond</p>\n<p>his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction</p>\n<p>pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!</p>\n<p>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,</p>\n<p>I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and</p>",
        "<p>Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 9</h3>\n<p>Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have</p>\n<p>been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of</p>\n<p>inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope</p>\n<p>and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed</p>\n<p>freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my</p>\n<p>heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered</p>",
        "<p>like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond</p>\n<p>description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet</p>\n<p>behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.</p>\n<p>I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment</p>\n<p>when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow</p>\n<p>beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience</p>\n<p>which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and</p>",
        "<p>from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and</p>\n<p>the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures</p>\n<p>such as no language can describe.</p>\n<p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never</p>\n<p>entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned</p>\n<p>the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;</p>\n<p>solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.</p>",
        "<p>My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition</p>\n<p>and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his</p>\n<p>serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and</p>\n<p>awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.</p>\n<p>“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer</p>\n<p>also? No one could love a child more than I loved your</p>\n<p>brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but</p>",
        "<p>is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting</p>\n<p>their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty</p>\n<p>owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,</p>\n<p>or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for</p>\n<p>society.”</p>\n<p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I</p>\n<p>should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if</p>",
        "<p>remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my</p>\n<p>other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of</p>\n<p>despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.</p>\n<p>About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was</p>\n<p>particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at</p>\n<p>ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that</p>\n<p>hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome</p>",
        "<p>to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had</p>\n<p>retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the</p>\n<p>water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and</p>\n<p>sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to</p>\n<p>pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I</p>\n<p>was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only</p>\n<p>unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and</p>",
        "<p>heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and</p>\n<p>interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,</p>\n<p>I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters</p>\n<p>might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,</p>\n<p>when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly</p>\n<p>loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my</p>\n<p>father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them</p>",
        "<p>exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose</p>\n<p>among them?</p>\n<p>At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my</p>\n<p>mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that</p>\n<p>could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of</p>\n<p>unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had</p>\n<p>created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling</p>",
        "<p>that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,</p>\n<p>which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.</p>\n<p>There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained</p>\n<p>behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of</p>\n<p>him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to</p>\n<p>extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I</p>\n<p>reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds</p>",
        "<p>of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the</p>\n<p>Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished</p>\n<p>to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his</p>\n<p>head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.</p>\n<p>Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply</p>\n<p>shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and</p>\n<p>desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all</p>",
        "<p>pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she</p>\n<p>then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted</p>\n<p>and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth</p>\n<p>wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our</p>\n<p>future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from</p>\n<p>the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest</p>\n<p>smiles.</p>",
        "<p>“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of</p>\n<p>Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before</p>\n<p>appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and</p>\n<p>injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient</p>\n<p>days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to</p>\n<p>reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men</p>\n<p>appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am</p>",
        "<p>certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and</p>\n<p>if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly</p>\n<p>she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake</p>\n<p>of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,</p>\n<p>a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if</p>\n<p>it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human</p>\n<p>being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to</p>",
        "<p>remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel</p>\n<p>she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.</p>\n<p>Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can</p>\n<p>assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on</p>\n<p>the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and</p>\n<p>endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were</p>\n<p>assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,</p>",
        "<p>and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the</p>\n<p>scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a</p>\n<p>wretch.”</p>\n<p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,</p>\n<p>but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my</p>\n<p>countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you</p>\n<p>must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how</p>",
        "<p>deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of</p>\n<p>despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me</p>\n<p>tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the</p>\n<p>friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost</p>\n<p>the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are</p>\n<p>true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native</p>\n<p>country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our</p>",
        "<p>peace?”</p>\n<p>And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every</p>\n<p>other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my</p>\n<p>heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at</p>\n<p>that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.</p>\n<p>Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of</p>\n<p>heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were</p>",
        "<p>ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial</p>\n<p>influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting</p>\n<p>limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had</p>\n<p>pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but</p>\n<p>sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily</p>\n<p>exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable</p>",
        "<p>sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left</p>\n<p>my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought</p>\n<p>in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and</p>\n<p>my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed</p>\n<p>towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my</p>\n<p>boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought</p>\n<p>had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.</p>",
        "<p>I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards</p>\n<p>hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive</p>\n<p>injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the</p>\n<p>middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of</p>\n<p>Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The</p>\n<p>weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in</p>\n<p>the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung</p>",
        "<p>me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and</p>\n<p>the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as</p>\n<p>Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less</p>\n<p>almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here</p>\n<p>displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,</p>\n<p>the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.</p>\n<p>Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the</p>",
        "<p>impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from</p>\n<p>among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was</p>\n<p>augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and</p>\n<p>shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another</p>\n<p>earth, the habitations of another race of beings.</p>\n<p>I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river</p>\n<p>forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that</p>",
        "<p>overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This</p>\n<p>valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and</p>\n<p>picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The</p>\n<p>high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no</p>\n<p>more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached</p>\n<p>the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and</p>\n<p>marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and</p>",
        "<p>magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,</p>\n<p>and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.</p>\n<p>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this</p>\n<p>journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and</p>\n<p>recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the</p>\n<p>lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing</p>\n<p>accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the</p>",
        "<p>kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief</p>\n<p>and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my</p>\n<p>animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,</p>\n<p>myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on</p>\n<p>the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.</p>\n<p>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded</p>\n<p>to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.</p>",
        "<p>For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid</p>\n<p>lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of</p>\n<p>the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds</p>\n<p>acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head</p>\n<p>upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed</p>\n<p>the giver of oblivion.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter 10</h3>\n<p>I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside</p>\n<p>the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that</p>\n<p>with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to</p>\n<p>barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before</p>\n<p>me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were</p>\n<p>scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious</p>",
        "<p>presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling</p>\n<p>waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the</p>\n<p>avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the</p>\n<p>accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,</p>\n<p>was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in</p>\n<p>their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the</p>\n<p>greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me</p>",
        "<p>from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my</p>\n<p>grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they</p>\n<p>diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the</p>\n<p>last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,</p>\n<p>waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I</p>\n<p>had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the</p>\n<p>unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,</p>",
        "<p>and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all</p>\n<p>gathered round me and bade me be at peace.</p>\n<p>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of</p>\n<p>soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every</p>\n<p>thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the</p>\n<p>summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those</p>\n<p>mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them</p>",
        "<p>in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was</p>\n<p>brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of</p>\n<p>Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous</p>\n<p>and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.</p>\n<p>It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the</p>\n<p>soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.</p>\n<p>The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the</p>",
        "<p>effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing</p>\n<p>cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well</p>\n<p>acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the</p>\n<p>solitary grandeur of the scene.</p>\n<p>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short</p>\n<p>windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the</p>\n<p>mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots</p>",
        "<p>the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie</p>\n<p>broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,</p>\n<p>leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon</p>\n<p>other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines</p>\n<p>of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is</p>\n<p>particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking</p>\n<p>in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw</p>",
        "<p>destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or</p>\n<p>luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.</p>\n<p>I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers</p>\n<p>which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite</p>\n<p>mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain</p>\n<p>poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I</p>\n<p>received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of</p>",
        "<p>sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders</p>\n<p>them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,</p>\n<p>thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by</p>\n<p>every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may</p>\n<p>convey to us.</p>\n<p>We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.</p>\n<p>We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.</p>",
        "<p>We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,</p>\n<p>Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;</p>\n<p>It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,</p>\n<p>The path of its departure still is free.</p>\n<p>Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;</p>\n<p>Nought may endure but mutability!</p>\n<p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some</p>",
        "<p>time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered</p>\n<p>both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated</p>\n<p>the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very</p>\n<p>uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and</p>\n<p>interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a</p>\n<p>league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The</p>\n<p>opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I</p>",
        "<p>now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;</p>\n<p>and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess</p>\n<p>of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,</p>\n<p>or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,</p>\n<p>whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering</p>\n<p>peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was</p>\n<p>before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,</p>",
        "<p>“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow</p>\n<p>beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,</p>\n<p>away from the joys of life.”</p>\n<p>As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,</p>\n<p>advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the</p>\n<p>crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his</p>\n<p>stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was</p>",
        "<p>troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,</p>\n<p>but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I</p>\n<p>perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)</p>\n<p>that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and</p>\n<p>horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in</p>\n<p>mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,</p>\n<p>combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness</p>",
        "<p>rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely</p>\n<p>observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,</p>\n<p>and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious</p>\n<p>detestation and contempt.</p>\n<p>“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do</p>\n<p>not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?</p>\n<p>Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,</p>",
        "<p>oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore</p>\n<p>those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”</p>\n<p>“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the</p>\n<p>wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all</p>\n<p>living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,</p>\n<p>to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of</p>\n<p>one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?</p>",
        "<p>Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of</p>\n<p>mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and</p>\n<p>you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it</p>\n<p>be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”</p>\n<p>“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too</p>\n<p>mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with</p>\n<p>your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I</p>",
        "<p>so negligently bestowed.”</p>\n<p>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the</p>\n<p>feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.</p>\n<p>He easily eluded me and said,</p>\n<p>“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred</p>\n<p>on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to</p>\n<p>increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of</p>",
        "<p>anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made</p>\n<p>me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my</p>\n<p>joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in</p>\n<p>opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and</p>\n<p>docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,</p>\n<p>the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every</p>\n<p>other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy</p>",
        "<p>clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;</p>\n<p>I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou</p>\n<p>drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I</p>\n<p>alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made</p>\n<p>me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”</p>\n<p>“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you</p>\n<p>and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,</p>",
        "<p>in which one must fall.”</p>\n<p>“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a</p>\n<p>favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and</p>\n<p>compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed</p>\n<p>with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my</p>\n<p>creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,</p>\n<p>who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and</p>",
        "<p>dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the</p>\n<p>caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the</p>\n<p>only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they</p>\n<p>are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind</p>\n<p>knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for</p>\n<p>my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep</p>\n<p>no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my</p>",
        "<p>wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver</p>\n<p>them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that</p>\n<p>not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be</p>\n<p>swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be</p>\n<p>moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard</p>\n<p>that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.</p>\n<p>But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they</p>",
        "<p>are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen</p>\n<p>to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with</p>\n<p>a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the</p>\n<p>eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,</p>\n<p>and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”</p>\n<p>“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of</p>\n<p>which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and</p>",
        "<p>author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw</p>\n<p>light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!</p>\n<p>You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power</p>\n<p>to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from</p>\n<p>the sight of your detested form.”</p>\n<p>“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands</p>\n<p>before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from</p>",
        "<p>thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant</p>\n<p>me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this</p>\n<p>from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of</p>\n<p>this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon</p>\n<p>the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends</p>\n<p>to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another</p>\n<p>world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,</p>",
        "<p>whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless</p>\n<p>life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of</p>\n<p>your own speedy ruin.”</p>\n<p>As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart</p>\n<p>was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the</p>\n<p>various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to</p>\n<p>his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my</p>",
        "<p>resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my</p>\n<p>brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.</p>\n<p>For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards</p>\n<p>his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I</p>\n<p>complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with</p>\n<p>his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite</p>\n<p>rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we</p>",
        "<p>entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy</p>\n<p>heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating</p>\n<p>myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began</p>\n<p>his tale.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 11</h3>\n<p>“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of</p>\n<p>my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.</p>\n<p>A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,</p>\n<p>and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I</p>\n<p>learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By</p>\n<p>degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I</p>",
        "<p>was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled</p>\n<p>me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now</p>\n<p>suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,</p>\n<p>descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.</p>\n<p>Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my</p>\n<p>touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with</p>\n<p>no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light</p>",
        "<p>became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I</p>\n<p>walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the</p>\n<p>forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting</p>\n<p>from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This</p>\n<p>roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I</p>\n<p>found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst</p>\n<p>at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>",
        "<p>“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it</p>\n<p>were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted</p>\n<p>your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some</p>\n<p>clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of</p>\n<p>night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could</p>\n<p>distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat</p>\n<p>down and wept.</p>",
        "<p>“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of</p>\n<p>pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the</p>\n<p>trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,</p>\n<p>but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.</p>\n<p>I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with</p>\n<p>which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct</p>\n<p>ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,</p>",
        "<p>and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on</p>\n<p>all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could</p>\n<p>distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with</p>\n<p>pleasure.</p>\n<p>“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had</p>\n<p>greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each</p>\n<p>other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with</p>",
        "<p>drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted</p>\n<p>when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my</p>\n<p>ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had</p>\n<p>often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,</p>\n<p>with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the</p>\n<p>boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I</p>\n<p>tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.</p>",
        "<p>Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the</p>\n<p>uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into</p>\n<p>silence again.</p>\n<p>“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened</p>\n<p>form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My</p>\n<p>sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every</p>\n<p>day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to</p>",
        "<p>perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from</p>\n<p>the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the</p>\n<p>sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and</p>\n<p>thrush were sweet and enticing.</p>\n<p>“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been</p>\n<p>left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the</p>\n<p>warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live</p>",
        "<p>embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,</p>\n<p>I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I</p>\n<p>examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be</p>\n<p>composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet</p>\n<p>and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the</p>\n<p>operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat</p>\n<p>dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching</p>",
        "<p>the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in</p>\n<p>collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a</p>\n<p>plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with</p>\n<p>it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I</p>\n<p>covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches</p>\n<p>upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank</p>\n<p>into sleep.</p>",
        "<p>“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.</p>\n<p>I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I</p>\n<p>observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the</p>\n<p>embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I</p>\n<p>found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that</p>\n<p>the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found</p>\n<p>some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and</p>",
        "<p>tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I</p>\n<p>tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on</p>\n<p>the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this</p>\n<p>operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.</p>\n<p>“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day</p>\n<p>searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When</p>\n<p>I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto</p>",
        "<p>inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be</p>\n<p>more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the</p>\n<p>loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how</p>\n<p>to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of</p>\n<p>this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply</p>\n<p>it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood</p>\n<p>towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at</p>",
        "<p>length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken</p>\n<p>place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the</p>\n<p>appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold</p>\n<p>damp substance that covered the ground.</p>\n<p>“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and</p>\n<p>shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which</p>\n<p>had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This</p>",
        "<p>was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great</p>\n<p>curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,</p>\n<p>near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on</p>\n<p>hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the</p>\n<p>hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form</p>\n<p>hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever</p>\n<p>before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted</p>",
        "<p>by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not</p>\n<p>penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite</p>\n<p>and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell</p>\n<p>after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the</p>\n<p>remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,</p>\n<p>milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by</p>\n<p>fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.</p>",
        "<p>“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which</p>\n<p>shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my</p>\n<p>travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a</p>\n<p>wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until</p>\n<p>at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The</p>\n<p>huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by</p>\n<p>turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw</p>",
        "<p>placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One</p>\n<p>of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within</p>\n<p>the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.</p>\n<p>The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,</p>\n<p>grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I</p>\n<p>escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,</p>\n<p>quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had</p>",
        "<p>beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat</p>\n<p>and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I</p>\n<p>dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so</p>\n<p>low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,</p>\n<p>was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and</p>\n<p>although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an</p>\n<p>agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.</p>",
        "<p>“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,</p>\n<p>however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more</p>\n<p>from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my</p>\n<p>kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could</p>\n<p>remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back</p>\n<p>of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig</p>\n<p>sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had</p>",
        "<p>crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived</p>\n<p>with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on</p>\n<p>occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and</p>\n<p>that was sufficient for me.</p>\n<p>“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I</p>\n<p>retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered</p>\n<p>too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I</p>",
        "<p>had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf</p>\n<p>of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink</p>\n<p>more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by</p>\n<p>my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept</p>\n<p>perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was</p>\n<p>tolerably warm.</p>\n<p>“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until</p>",
        "<p>something should occur which might alter my determination. It was</p>\n<p>indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,</p>\n<p>the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with</p>\n<p>pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little</p>\n<p>water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld</p>\n<p>a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The</p>\n<p>girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found</p>",
        "<p>cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a</p>\n<p>coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair</p>\n<p>hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost</p>\n<p>sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing</p>\n<p>the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,</p>\n<p>seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose</p>\n<p>countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with</p>",
        "<p>an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the</p>\n<p>cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw</p>\n<p>the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field</p>\n<p>behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the</p>\n<p>house and sometimes in the yard.</p>\n<p>“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the</p>\n<p>cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been</p>",
        "<p>filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost</p>\n<p>imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.</p>\n<p>Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean</p>\n<p>but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an</p>\n<p>old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The</p>\n<p>young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she</p>\n<p>took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat</p>",
        "<p>down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play</p>\n<p>and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the</p>\n<p>nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had</p>\n<p>never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent</p>\n<p>countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle</p>\n<p>manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air</p>\n<p>which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of</p>",
        "<p>which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then</p>\n<p>pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt</p>\n<p>at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection</p>\n<p>that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were</p>\n<p>a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,</p>\n<p>either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the</p>\n<p>window, unable to bear these emotions.</p>",
        "<p>“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a</p>\n<p>load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of</p>\n<p>his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on</p>\n<p>the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,</p>\n<p>and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed</p>\n<p>pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she</p>\n<p>placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her</p>",
        "<p>work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily</p>\n<p>employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed</p>\n<p>thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the</p>\n<p>cottage together.</p>\n<p>“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance</p>\n<p>of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to</p>\n<p>eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again</p>",
        "<p>occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the</p>\n<p>cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.</p>\n<p>Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent</p>\n<p>creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming</p>\n<p>with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his</p>\n<p>figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his</p>\n<p>eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The</p>",
        "<p>old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different</p>\n<p>from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the</p>\n<p>fields.</p>\n<p>“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the</p>\n<p>cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was</p>\n<p>delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the</p>\n<p>pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening</p>",
        "<p>the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations</p>\n<p>which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the</p>\n<p>instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in</p>\n<p>the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,</p>\n<p>but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the</p>\n<p>harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since</p>\n<p>found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the</p>",
        "<p>science of words or letters.</p>\n<p>“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,</p>\n<p>extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 12</h3>\n<p>“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the</p>\n<p>occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners</p>\n<p>of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I</p>\n<p>remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from</p>\n<p>the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I</p>\n<p>might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would</p>",
        "<p>remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the</p>\n<p>motives which influenced their actions.</p>\n<p>“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman</p>\n<p>arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed</p>\n<p>after the first meal.</p>\n<p>“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.</p>\n<p>The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in</p>",
        "<p>various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon</p>\n<p>perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or</p>\n<p>in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the</p>\n<p>younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They</p>\n<p>performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with</p>\n<p>gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.</p>\n<p>“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often</p>",
        "<p>went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,</p>\n<p>but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were</p>\n<p>miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,</p>\n<p>should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They</p>\n<p>possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every</p>\n<p>luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands</p>\n<p>when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,</p>",
        "<p>they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day</p>\n<p>looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they</p>\n<p>really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,</p>\n<p>but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which</p>\n<p>were at first enigmatic.</p>\n<p>“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of</p>\n<p>the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they</p>",
        "<p>suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment</p>\n<p>consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of</p>\n<p>one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters</p>\n<p>could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,</p>\n<p>suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two</p>\n<p>younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old</p>\n<p>man when they reserved none for themselves.</p>",
        "<p>“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,</p>\n<p>during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own</p>\n<p>consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on</p>\n<p>the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and</p>\n<p>roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.</p>\n<p>“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist</p>\n<p>their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day</p>",
        "<p>in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often</p>\n<p>took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home</p>\n<p>firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.</p>\n<p>“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she</p>\n<p>opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great</p>\n<p>pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the</p>\n<p>youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,</p>",
        "<p>that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the</p>\n<p>cottage and cultivating the garden.</p>\n<p>“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that</p>\n<p>these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and</p>\n<p>feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words</p>\n<p>they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the</p>\n<p>minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,</p>",
        "<p>and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in</p>\n<p>every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and</p>\n<p>the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible</p>\n<p>objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the</p>\n<p>mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having</p>\n<p>remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I</p>\n<p>discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of</p>",
        "<p>discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and</p>\n<p>_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth</p>\n<p>and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only</p>\n<p>one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or</p>\n<p>_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot</p>\n<p>describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of</p>\n<p>these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other</p>",
        "<p>words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,</p>\n<p>dearest, unhappy._</p>\n<p>“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of</p>\n<p>the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I</p>\n<p>felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw</p>\n<p>few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the</p>\n<p>cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the</p>",
        "<p>superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,</p>\n<p>often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that</p>\n<p>he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a</p>\n<p>cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure</p>\n<p>even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled</p>\n<p>with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I</p>\n<p>generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after</p>",
        "<p>having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus</p>\n<p>with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my</p>\n<p>unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his</p>\n<p>friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more</p>\n<p>cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old</p>\n<p>man.</p>\n<p>“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked</p>",
        "<p>the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty</p>\n<p>and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little</p>\n<p>white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in</p>\n<p>the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that</p>\n<p>obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and</p>\n<p>brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual</p>\n<p>astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible</p>",
        "<p>hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring</p>\n<p>farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,</p>\n<p>yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,</p>\n<p>but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old</p>\n<p>man and Agatha.</p>\n<p>“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I</p>\n<p>discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when</p>",
        "<p>he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs</p>\n<p>for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend</p>\n<p>these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand</p>\n<p>the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,</p>\n<p>sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of</p>\n<p>conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I</p>\n<p>easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to</p>",
        "<p>the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become</p>\n<p>master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them</p>\n<p>overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast</p>\n<p>perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>\n<p>“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,</p>\n<p>and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself</p>\n<p>in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that</p>",
        "<p>it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became</p>\n<p>fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was</p>\n<p>filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.</p>\n<p>Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable</p>\n<p>deformity.</p>\n<p>“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow</p>\n<p>vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this</p>",
        "<p>time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of</p>\n<p>impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was</p>\n<p>coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.</p>\n<p>Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they</p>\n<p>dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season</p>\n<p>advanced.</p>\n<p>“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did</p>",
        "<p>not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its</p>\n<p>waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the</p>\n<p>earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.</p>\n<p>“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I</p>\n<p>attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in</p>\n<p>various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in</p>\n<p>observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any</p>",
        "<p>moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected</p>\n<p>my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it</p>\n<p>was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those</p>\n<p>offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these</p>\n<p>labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and</p>\n<p>once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good</p>\n<p>spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification</p>",
        "<p>of these terms.</p>\n<p>“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the</p>\n<p>motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to</p>\n<p>know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought</p>\n<p>(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to</p>\n<p>these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the</p>\n<p>venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix</p>",
        "<p>flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be</p>\n<p>the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a</p>\n<p>thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of</p>\n<p>me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle</p>\n<p>demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and</p>\n<p>afterwards their love.</p>\n<p>“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to</p>",
        "<p>the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but</p>\n<p>supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their</p>\n<p>tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.</p>\n<p>It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose</p>\n<p>intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved</p>\n<p>better treatment than blows and execration.</p>\n<p>“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the</p>",
        "<p>aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been</p>\n<p>hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of</p>\n<p>cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves</p>\n<p>began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation</p>\n<p>for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and</p>\n<p>unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of</p>\n<p>nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,</p>",
        "<p>and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 13</h3>\n<p>“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate</p>\n<p>events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,</p>\n<p>have made me what I am.</p>\n<p>“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies</p>\n<p>cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy</p>\n<p>should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My</p>",
        "<p>senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and</p>\n<p>a thousand sights of beauty.</p>\n<p>“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested</p>\n<p>from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children</p>\n<p>listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was</p>\n<p>melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father</p>\n<p>paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired</p>",
        "<p>the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and</p>\n<p>the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.</p>\n<p>“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.</p>\n<p>The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black</p>\n<p>veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by</p>\n<p>pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was</p>\n<p>musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,</p>",
        "<p>Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her</p>\n<p>veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her</p>\n<p>hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were</p>\n<p>dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular</p>\n<p>proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with</p>\n<p>a lovely pink.</p>\n<p>“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of</p>",
        "<p>sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of</p>\n<p>ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his</p>\n<p>eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I</p>\n<p>thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by</p>\n<p>different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held</p>\n<p>out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as</p>\n<p>well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to</p>",
        "<p>understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and</p>\n<p>dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some</p>\n<p>conversation took place between him and his father, and the young</p>\n<p>stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,</p>\n<p>but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.</p>\n<p>“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds</p>\n<p>and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood</p>",
        "<p>by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I</p>\n<p>did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness</p>\n<p>through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the</p>\n<p>morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of</p>\n<p>delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed</p>\n<p>the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made</p>\n<p>signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she</p>",
        "<p>came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,</p>\n<p>expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I</p>\n<p>found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger</p>\n<p>repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;</p>\n<p>and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the</p>\n<p>same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty</p>\n<p>words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had</p>",
        "<p>before understood, but I profited by the others.</p>\n<p>“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they</p>\n<p>separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night</p>\n<p>sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and</p>\n<p>by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely</p>\n<p>guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to</p>\n<p>understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found</p>",
        "<p>it utterly impossible.</p>\n<p>“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual</p>\n<p>occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the</p>\n<p>old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly</p>\n<p>beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my</p>\n<p>eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or</p>\n<p>dying away like a nightingale of the woods.</p>",
        "<p>“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first</p>\n<p>declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in</p>\n<p>sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old</p>\n<p>man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to</p>\n<p>explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she</p>\n<p>bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.</p>\n<p>“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration</p>",
        "<p>that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.</p>\n<p>Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the</p>\n<p>knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most</p>\n<p>of the words uttered by my protectors.</p>\n<p>“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and</p>\n<p>the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the</p>\n<p>scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;</p>",
        "<p>the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal</p>\n<p>rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably</p>\n<p>shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never</p>\n<p>ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same</p>\n<p>treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.</p>\n<p>“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily</p>\n<p>master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than</p>",
        "<p>the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken</p>\n<p>accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that</p>\n<p>was spoken.</p>\n<p>“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as</p>\n<p>it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field</p>\n<p>for wonder and delight.</p>\n<p>“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins</p>",
        "<p>of Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not</p>\n<p>Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this</p>\n<p>work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the</p>\n<p>Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history</p>\n<p>and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave</p>\n<p>me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different</p>\n<p>nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous</p>",
        "<p>genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue</p>\n<p>of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the</p>\n<p>decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard</p>\n<p>of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the</p>\n<p>hapless fate of its original inhabitants.</p>\n<p>“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was</p>\n<p>man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so</p>",
        "<p>vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil</p>\n<p>principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and</p>\n<p>godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour</p>\n<p>that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on</p>\n<p>record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more</p>\n<p>abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I</p>\n<p>could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or</p>",
        "<p>even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of</p>\n<p>vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and</p>\n<p>loathing.</p>\n<p>“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.</p>\n<p>While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the</p>\n<p>Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I</p>\n<p>heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid</p>",
        "<p>poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.</p>\n<p>“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the</p>\n<p>possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and</p>\n<p>unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with</p>\n<p>only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,</p>\n<p>except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to</p>\n<p>waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of</p>",
        "<p>my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I</p>\n<p>possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,</p>\n<p>endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even</p>\n<p>of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could</p>\n<p>subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with</p>\n<p>less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked</p>\n<p>around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot</p>",
        "<p>upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?</p>\n<p>“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted</p>\n<p>upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with</p>\n<p>knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor</p>\n<p>known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!</p>\n<p>“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it</p>\n<p>has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to</p>",
        "<p>shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one</p>\n<p>means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state</p>\n<p>which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good</p>\n<p>feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my</p>\n<p>cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except</p>\n<p>through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and</p>\n<p>unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of</p>",
        "<p>becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the</p>\n<p>animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild</p>\n<p>exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved</p>\n<p>Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>\n<p>“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the</p>\n<p>difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the</p>\n<p>father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the</p>",
        "<p>older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up</p>\n<p>in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained</p>\n<p>knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which</p>\n<p>bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.</p>\n<p>“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my</p>\n<p>infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if</p>\n<p>they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I</p>",
        "<p>distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I</p>\n<p>then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being</p>\n<p>resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The</p>\n<p>question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.</p>\n<p>“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to</p>\n<p>return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various</p>\n<p>feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated</p>",
        "<p>in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in</p>\n<p>an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 14</h3>\n<p>“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was</p>\n<p>one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding</p>\n<p>as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to</p>\n<p>one so utterly inexperienced as I was.</p>\n<p>“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good</p>\n<p>family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,</p>",
        "<p>respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred</p>\n<p>in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the</p>\n<p>highest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in</p>\n<p>a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and</p>\n<p>possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or</p>\n<p>taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.</p>\n<p>“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a</p>",
        "<p>Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some</p>\n<p>reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.</p>\n<p>He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from</p>\n<p>Constantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The</p>\n<p>injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;</p>\n<p>and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime</p>\n<p>alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.</p>",
        "<p>“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and</p>\n<p>indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the</p>\n<p>court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then</p>\n<p>looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain</p>\n<p>admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an</p>\n<p>unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the</p>\n<p>unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the</p>",
        "<p>execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night</p>\n<p>and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,</p>\n<p>amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer</p>\n<p>by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with</p>\n<p>contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit</p>\n<p>her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the</p>\n<p>youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed</p>",
        "<p>a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.</p>\n<p>“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made</p>\n<p>on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in</p>\n<p>his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he</p>\n<p>should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to</p>\n<p>accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the</p>\n<p>event as to the consummation of his happiness.</p>",
        "<p>“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for</p>\n<p>the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several</p>\n<p>letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to</p>\n<p>express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old</p>\n<p>man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in</p>\n<p>the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and</p>\n<p>at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.</p>",
        "<p>“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence</p>\n<p>in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters</p>\n<p>were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will</p>\n<p>give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,</p>\n<p>as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat</p>\n<p>the substance of them to you.</p>\n<p>“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a</p>",
        "<p>slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of</p>\n<p>the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and</p>\n<p>enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the</p>\n<p>bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in</p>\n<p>the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of</p>\n<p>intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female</p>\n<p>followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly</p>",
        "<p>impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again</p>\n<p>returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,</p>\n<p>allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to</p>\n<p>the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble</p>\n<p>emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and</p>\n<p>remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in</p>\n<p>society was enchanting to her.</p>",
        "<p>“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night</p>\n<p>previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant</p>\n<p>many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of</p>\n<p>his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his</p>\n<p>plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under</p>\n<p>the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in</p>\n<p>an obscure part of Paris.</p>",
        "<p>“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont</p>\n<p>Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable</p>\n<p>opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.</p>\n<p>“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his</p>\n<p>departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she</p>\n<p>should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in</p>\n<p>expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society</p>",
        "<p>of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest</p>\n<p>affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an</p>\n<p>interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie</p>\n<p>sang to him the divine airs of her native country.</p>\n<p>“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes</p>\n<p>of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other</p>\n<p>plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a</p>",
        "<p>Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear</p>\n<p>lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer</p>\n<p>if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they</p>\n<p>inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled</p>\n<p>to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and</p>\n<p>secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans</p>\n<p>were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.</p>",
        "<p>“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their</p>\n<p>victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The</p>\n<p>plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were</p>\n<p>thrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his</p>\n<p>dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay</p>\n<p>in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of</p>\n<p>her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged</p>",
        "<p>with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity</p>\n<p>for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a</p>\n<p>boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,</p>\n<p>he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the</p>\n<p>law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.</p>\n<p>“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the</p>\n<p>trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune</p>",
        "<p>and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.</p>\n<p>“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I</p>\n<p>discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for</p>\n<p>whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on</p>\n<p>discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,</p>\n<p>became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with</p>\n<p>his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,</p>",
        "<p>as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.</p>\n<p>“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered</p>\n<p>him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could</p>\n<p>have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his</p>\n<p>virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss</p>\n<p>of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The</p>\n<p>arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.</p>",
        "<p>“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth</p>\n<p>and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her</p>\n<p>lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous</p>\n<p>nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to</p>\n<p>expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his</p>\n<p>tyrannical mandate.</p>\n<p>“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told</p>",
        "<p>her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn</p>\n<p>had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the</p>\n<p>French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to</p>\n<p>Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He</p>\n<p>intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential</p>\n<p>servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his</p>\n<p>property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.</p>",
        "<p>“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it</p>\n<p>would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey</p>\n<p>was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse</p>\n<p>to it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she</p>\n<p>heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where</p>\n<p>he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her</p>\n<p>determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a</p>",
        "<p>sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,</p>\n<p>but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for</p>\n<p>Germany.</p>\n<p>“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage</p>\n<p>of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her</p>\n<p>with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the</p>\n<p>Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country</p>",
        "<p>and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,</p>\n<p>into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for</p>\n<p>which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in</p>\n<p>which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at</p>\n<p>the cottage of her lover.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 15</h3>\n<p>“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.</p>\n<p>I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire</p>\n<p>their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.</p>\n<p>“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and</p>\n<p>generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to</p>\n<p>become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities</p>",
        "<p>were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the</p>\n<p>progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred</p>\n<p>in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.</p>\n<p>“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I</p>\n<p>collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on</p>\n<p>the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and</p>\n<p>some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.</p>",
        "<p>Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I</p>\n<p>had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume</p>\n<p>of _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The</p>\n<p>possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually</p>\n<p>studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were</p>\n<p>employed in their ordinary occupations.</p>\n<p>“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced</p>",
        "<p>in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me</p>\n<p>to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In</p>\n<p>the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting</p>\n<p>story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon</p>\n<p>what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a</p>\n<p>never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and</p>\n<p>domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and</p>",
        "<p>feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded</p>\n<p>well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which</p>\n<p>were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a</p>\n<p>more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character</p>\n<p>contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon</p>\n<p>death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not</p>\n<p>pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards</p>",
        "<p>the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely</p>\n<p>understanding it.</p>\n<p>“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and</p>\n<p>condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely</p>\n<p>unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I</p>\n<p>was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I</p>\n<p>was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.</p>",
        "<p>‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my</p>\n<p>annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did</p>\n<p>this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my</p>\n<p>destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to</p>\n<p>solve them.</p>\n<p>“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the</p>\n<p>histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book</p>",
        "<p>had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I</p>\n<p>learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch</p>\n<p>taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my</p>\n<p>own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many</p>\n<p>things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very</p>\n<p>confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,</p>\n<p>and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and</p>",
        "<p>large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the</p>\n<p>only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book</p>\n<p>developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned</p>\n<p>in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the</p>\n<p>greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as</p>\n<p>far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they</p>\n<p>were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these</p>",
        "<p>feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,</p>\n<p>Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The</p>\n<p>patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a</p>\n<p>firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had</p>\n<p>been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should</p>\n<p>have been imbued with different sensations.</p>\n<p>“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read</p>",
        "<p>it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as</p>\n<p>a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the</p>\n<p>picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of</p>\n<p>exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity</p>\n<p>struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to</p>\n<p>any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine</p>\n<p>in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a</p>",
        "<p>perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of</p>\n<p>his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from</p>\n<p>beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.</p>\n<p>Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for</p>\n<p>often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter</p>\n<p>gall of envy rose within me.</p>\n<p>“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon</p>",
        "<p>after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of</p>\n<p>the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had</p>\n<p>neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in</p>\n<p>which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was</p>\n<p>your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You</p>\n<p>minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress</p>\n<p>of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic</p>",
        "<p>occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.</p>\n<p>Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed</p>\n<p>origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances</p>\n<p>which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious</p>\n<p>and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own</p>\n<p>horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful</p>\n<p>day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!</p>",
        "<p>Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in</p>\n<p>disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own</p>\n<p>image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the</p>\n<p>very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire</p>\n<p>and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’</p>\n<p>“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;</p>\n<p>but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and</p>",
        "<p>benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should</p>\n<p>become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would</p>\n<p>compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn</p>\n<p>from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion</p>\n<p>and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way</p>\n<p>to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I</p>\n<p>postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance</p>",
        "<p>attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.</p>\n<p>Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every</p>\n<p>day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking</p>\n<p>until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.</p>\n<p>“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The</p>\n<p>presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also</p>\n<p>found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha</p>",
        "<p>spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in</p>\n<p>their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were</p>\n<p>contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while</p>\n<p>mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only</p>\n<p>discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I</p>\n<p>cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person</p>\n<p>reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail</p>",
        "<p>image and that inconstant shade.</p>\n<p>“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial</p>\n<p>which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my</p>\n<p>thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and</p>\n<p>dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my</p>\n<p>feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed</p>\n<p>smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my</p>",
        "<p>sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s</p>\n<p>supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,</p>\n<p>and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.</p>\n<p>“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay</p>\n<p>and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it</p>\n<p>had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did</p>\n<p>not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my</p>",
        "<p>conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief</p>\n<p>delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay</p>\n<p>apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention</p>\n<p>towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the</p>\n<p>absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and</p>\n<p>their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the</p>\n<p>casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the</p>",
        "<p>greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my</p>\n<p>heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see</p>\n<p>their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost</p>\n<p>limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from</p>\n<p>me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were</p>\n<p>never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a</p>\n<p>little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not</p>",
        "<p>believe myself utterly unworthy of it.</p>\n<p>“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken</p>\n<p>place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely</p>\n<p>directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my</p>\n<p>protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally</p>\n<p>fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.</p>\n<p>I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my</p>",
        "<p>person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly</p>\n<p>beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I</p>\n<p>thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain</p>\n<p>the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means</p>\n<p>be tolerated by my younger protectors.</p>\n<p>“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground</p>\n<p>and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,</p>",
        "<p>and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own</p>\n<p>desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,</p>\n<p>he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more</p>\n<p>sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his</p>\n<p>countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,</p>\n<p>thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the</p>\n<p>instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.</p>",
        "<p>“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which</p>\n<p>would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a</p>\n<p>neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an</p>\n<p>excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my</p>\n<p>limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting</p>\n<p>all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had</p>\n<p>placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived</p>",
        "<p>me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their</p>\n<p>cottage.</p>\n<p>“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’</p>\n<p>“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am</p>\n<p>a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you</p>\n<p>would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’</p>\n<p>“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what</p>",
        "<p>manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are</p>\n<p>from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to</p>\n<p>procure food for you.’</p>\n<p>“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is</p>\n<p>warmth and rest only that I need.’</p>\n<p>“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was</p>\n<p>precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence</p>",
        "<p>the interview, when the old man addressed me.</p>\n<p>‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you</p>\n<p>French?’</p>\n<p>“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that</p>\n<p>language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,</p>\n<p>whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’</p>\n<p>“‘Are they Germans?’</p>",
        "<p>“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an</p>\n<p>unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation</p>\n<p>or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never</p>\n<p>seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail</p>\n<p>there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’</p>\n<p>“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but</p>\n<p>the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are</p>",
        "<p>full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;</p>\n<p>and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’</p>\n<p>“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;</p>\n<p>but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good</p>\n<p>dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree</p>\n<p>beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they</p>\n<p>ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable</p>",
        "<p>monster.’</p>\n<p>“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot</p>\n<p>you undeceive them?’</p>\n<p>“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I</p>\n<p>feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I</p>\n<p>have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily</p>\n<p>kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and</p>",
        "<p>it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’</p>\n<p>“‘Where do these friends reside?’</p>\n<p>“‘Near this spot.’</p>\n<p>“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly</p>\n<p>confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in</p>\n<p>undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but</p>\n<p>there is something in your words which persuades me that you are</p>",
        "<p>sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure</p>\n<p>to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’</p>\n<p>“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You</p>\n<p>raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,</p>\n<p>I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow</p>\n<p>creatures.’</p>\n<p>“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only</p>",
        "<p>drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am</p>\n<p>unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;</p>\n<p>judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’</p>\n<p>“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips</p>\n<p>first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall</p>\n<p>be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success</p>\n<p>with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’</p>",
        "<p>“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’</p>\n<p>“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to</p>\n<p>rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for</p>\n<p>firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my</p>\n<p>remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that</p>\n<p>moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment</p>\n<p>to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the</p>",
        "<p>time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I</p>\n<p>seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’</p>\n<p>“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’</p>\n<p>“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and</p>\n<p>Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on</p>\n<p>beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her</p>\n<p>friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with</p>",
        "<p>supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in</p>\n<p>a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently</p>\n<p>with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends</p>\n<p>the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and</p>\n<p>I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,</p>\n<p>overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general</p>\n<p>tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 16</h3>\n<p>“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I</p>\n<p>not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly</p>\n<p>bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my</p>\n<p>feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have</p>\n<p>destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with</p>\n<p>their shrieks and misery.</p>",
        "<p>“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and</p>\n<p>now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my</p>\n<p>anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken</p>\n<p>the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging</p>\n<p>through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable</p>\n<p>night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees</p>\n<p>waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird</p>",
        "<p>burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest</p>\n<p>or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and</p>\n<p>finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread</p>\n<p>havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed</p>\n<p>the ruin.</p>\n<p>“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became</p>\n<p>fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in</p>",
        "<p>the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men</p>\n<p>that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness</p>\n<p>towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war</p>\n<p>against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me</p>\n<p>and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.</p>\n<p>“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was</p>\n<p>impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid</p>",
        "<p>myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours</p>\n<p>to reflection on my situation.</p>\n<p>“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some</p>\n<p>degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the</p>\n<p>cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my</p>\n<p>conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that</p>\n<p>my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a</p>",
        "<p>fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I</p>\n<p>ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to</p>\n<p>have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have</p>\n<p>been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be</p>\n<p>irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the</p>\n<p>cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my</p>\n<p>party.</p>",
        "<p>“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound</p>\n<p>sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by</p>\n<p>peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever</p>\n<p>acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix</p>\n<p>tearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that</p>\n<p>it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in</p>\n<p>search of food.</p>",
        "<p>“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the</p>\n<p>well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.</p>\n<p>I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the</p>\n<p>accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun</p>\n<p>mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I</p>\n<p>trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside</p>\n<p>of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the</p>",
        "<p>agony of this suspense.</p>\n<p>“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they</p>\n<p>entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not</p>\n<p>understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,</p>\n<p>which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix</p>\n<p>approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not</p>\n<p>quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from</p>",
        "<p>his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.</p>\n<p>“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,</p>\n<p>‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose</p>\n<p>the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and</p>\n<p>I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your</p>\n<p>determination.’</p>\n<p>“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can</p>",
        "<p>never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest</p>\n<p>danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and</p>\n<p>my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason</p>\n<p>with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this</p>\n<p>place.’</p>\n<p>“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion</p>\n<p>entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then</p>",
        "<p>departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.</p>\n<p>“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of</p>\n<p>utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken</p>\n<p>the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the</p>\n<p>feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to</p>\n<p>control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I</p>\n<p>bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,</p>",
        "<p>of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the</p>\n<p>exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of</p>\n<p>tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had</p>\n<p>spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to</p>\n<p>injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As</p>\n<p>night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,</p>\n<p>and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,</p>",
        "<p>I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my</p>\n<p>operations.</p>\n<p>“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly</p>\n<p>dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore</p>\n<p>along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my</p>\n<p>spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the</p>\n<p>dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,</p>",
        "<p>my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon</p>\n<p>nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my</p>\n<p>brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,</p>\n<p>and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the</p>\n<p>cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and</p>\n<p>licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.</p>\n<p>“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of</p>",
        "<p>the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.</p>\n<p>“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I</p>\n<p>resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated</p>\n<p>and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the</p>\n<p>thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you</p>\n<p>were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness</p>\n<p>than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had</p>",
        "<p>bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from</p>\n<p>these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.</p>\n<p>You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards</p>\n<p>this place I resolved to proceed.</p>\n<p>“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a</p>\n<p>southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my</p>\n<p>only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass</p>",
        "<p>through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I</p>\n<p>did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although</p>\n<p>towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,</p>\n<p>heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions</p>\n<p>and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.</p>\n<p>But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I</p>\n<p>determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from</p>",
        "<p>any other being that wore the human form.</p>\n<p>“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was</p>\n<p>late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.</p>\n<p>I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a</p>\n<p>human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;</p>\n<p>rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface</p>\n<p>of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,</p>",
        "<p>earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The</p>\n<p>mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall</p>\n<p>and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more</p>\n<p>deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow</p>\n<p>fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents</p>\n<p>now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I</p>\n<p>often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me</p>",
        "<p>no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could</p>\n<p>not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived</p>\n<p>on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth</p>\n<p>and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial</p>\n<p>manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p>\n<p>“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was</p>\n<p>secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding</p>",
        "<p>that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey</p>\n<p>after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,</p>\n<p>cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of</p>\n<p>the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long</p>\n<p>appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of</p>\n<p>these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and</p>\n<p>forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears</p>",
        "<p>again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with</p>\n<p>thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.</p>\n<p>“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its</p>\n<p>boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many</p>\n<p>of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.</p>\n<p>Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard</p>\n<p>the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade</p>",
        "<p>of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running</p>\n<p>towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from</p>\n<p>someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides</p>\n<p>of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the</p>\n<p>rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,</p>\n<p>from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She</p>\n<p>was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore</p>",
        "<p>animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,</p>\n<p>who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On</p>\n<p>seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,</p>\n<p>hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I</p>\n<p>hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,</p>\n<p>which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my</p>\n<p>injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.</p>",
        "<p>“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being</p>\n<p>from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable</p>\n<p>pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of</p>\n<p>kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments</p>\n<p>before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by</p>\n<p>pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the</p>\n<p>agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.</p>",
        "<p>“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to</p>\n<p>cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,</p>\n<p>and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any</p>\n<p>rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented</p>\n<p>also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their</p>\n<p>infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,</p>\n<p>such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had</p>",
        "<p>endured.</p>\n<p>“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The</p>\n<p>labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or</p>\n<p>gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my</p>\n<p>desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for</p>\n<p>the enjoyment of pleasure.</p>\n<p>“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I</p>",
        "<p>reached the environs of Geneva.</p>\n<p>“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among</p>\n<p>the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply</p>\n<p>to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to</p>\n<p>enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting</p>\n<p>behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.</p>\n<p>“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,</p>",
        "<p>which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came</p>\n<p>running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of</p>\n<p>infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this</p>\n<p>little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have</p>\n<p>imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and</p>\n<p>educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in</p>\n<p>this peopled earth.</p>",
        "<p>“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him</p>\n<p>towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before</p>\n<p>his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his</p>\n<p>face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to</p>\n<p>hurt you; listen to me.’</p>\n<p>“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;</p>\n<p>‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You</p>",
        "<p>are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’</p>\n<p>“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’</p>\n<p>“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.</p>\n<p>Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’</p>\n<p>“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have</p>\n<p>sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’</p>\n<p>“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried</p>",
        "<p>despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a</p>\n<p>moment he lay dead at my feet.</p>\n<p>“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish</p>\n<p>triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;</p>\n<p>my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and</p>\n<p>a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’</p>\n<p>“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his</p>",
        "<p>breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite</p>\n<p>of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I</p>\n<p>gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her</p>\n<p>lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was</p>\n<p>for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could</p>\n<p>bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in</p>\n<p>regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one</p>",
        "<p>expressive of disgust and affright.</p>\n<p>“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only</p>\n<p>wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in</p>\n<p>exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the</p>\n<p>attempt to destroy them.</p>\n<p>“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had</p>\n<p>committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I</p>",
        "<p>entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was</p>\n<p>sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her</p>\n<p>whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the</p>\n<p>loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose</p>\n<p>joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over</p>\n<p>her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would</p>\n<p>give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my</p>",
        "<p>beloved, awake!’</p>\n<p>“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she</p>\n<p>indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus</p>\n<p>would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.</p>\n<p>The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but</p>\n<p>she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever</p>\n<p>robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had</p>",
        "<p>its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of</p>\n<p>Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work</p>\n<p>mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of</p>\n<p>the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.</p>\n<p>“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,</p>\n<p>sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and</p>\n<p>its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,</p>",
        "<p>and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning</p>\n<p>passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have</p>\n<p>promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man</p>\n<p>will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself</p>\n<p>would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species</p>\n<p>and have the same defects. This being you must create.”</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 17</h3>\n<p>The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the</p>\n<p>expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to</p>\n<p>arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his</p>\n<p>proposition. He continued,</p>\n<p>“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the</p>\n<p>interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone</p>",
        "<p>can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to</p>\n<p>concede.”</p>\n<p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had</p>\n<p>died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and</p>\n<p>as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within</p>\n<p>me.</p>\n<p>“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a</p>",
        "<p>consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you</p>\n<p>shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like</p>\n<p>yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I</p>\n<p>have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”</p>\n<p>“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead</p>\n<p>of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I</p>\n<p>am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,</p>",
        "<p>would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I</p>\n<p>should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you</p>\n<p>could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the</p>\n<p>work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him</p>\n<p>live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would</p>\n<p>bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.</p>\n<p>But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our</p>",
        "<p>union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will</p>\n<p>revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and</p>\n<p>chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear</p>\n<p>inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor</p>\n<p>finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of</p>\n<p>your birth.”</p>\n<p>A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled</p>",
        "<p>into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently</p>\n<p>he calmed himself and proceeded—</p>\n<p>“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do</p>\n<p>not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt</p>\n<p>emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a</p>\n<p>hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the</p>\n<p>whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.</p>",
        "<p>What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of</p>\n<p>another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it</p>\n<p>is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be</p>\n<p>monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more</p>\n<p>attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be</p>\n<p>harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me</p>\n<p>happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I</p>",
        "<p>excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my</p>\n<p>request!”</p>\n<p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences</p>\n<p>of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.</p>\n<p>His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature</p>\n<p>of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion</p>\n<p>of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of</p>",
        "<p>feeling and continued,</p>\n<p>“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see</p>\n<p>us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not</p>\n<p>that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;</p>\n<p>acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will</p>\n<p>be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.</p>\n<p>We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on</p>",
        "<p>man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful</p>\n<p>and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the</p>\n<p>wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,</p>\n<p>I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment</p>\n<p>and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”</p>\n<p>“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of</p>\n<p>man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your</p>",
        "<p>only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,</p>\n<p>persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and</p>\n<p>you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,</p>\n<p>and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.</p>\n<p>This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”</p>\n<p>“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by</p>\n<p>my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?</p>",
        "<p>I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that</p>\n<p>with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and</p>\n<p>dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions</p>\n<p>will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly</p>\n<p>away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”</p>\n<p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and</p>\n<p>sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when</p>",
        "<p>I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my</p>\n<p>feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle</p>\n<p>these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I</p>\n<p>had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which</p>\n<p>was yet in my power to bestow.</p>\n<p>“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not</p>\n<p>already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust</p>",
        "<p>you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by</p>\n<p>affording a wider scope for your revenge?”</p>\n<p>“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If</p>\n<p>I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;</p>\n<p>the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall</p>\n<p>become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices</p>\n<p>are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will</p>",
        "<p>necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel</p>\n<p>the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of</p>\n<p>existence and events from which I am now excluded.”</p>\n<p>I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various</p>\n<p>arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which</p>\n<p>he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight</p>\n<p>of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had</p>",
        "<p>manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my</p>\n<p>calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers</p>\n<p>and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices</p>\n<p>was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a</p>\n<p>long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and</p>\n<p>my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.</p>\n<p>Turning to him, therefore, I said,</p>",
        "<p>“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,</p>\n<p>and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall</p>\n<p>deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”</p>\n<p>“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of</p>\n<p>heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my</p>\n<p>prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your</p>\n<p>home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with</p>",
        "<p>unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall</p>\n<p>appear.”</p>\n<p>Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in</p>\n<p>my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than</p>\n<p>the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the</p>\n<p>sea of ice.</p>\n<p>His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of</p>",
        "<p>the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent</p>\n<p>towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my</p>\n<p>heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the</p>\n<p>little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced</p>\n<p>perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences</p>\n<p>of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the</p>\n<p>halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars</p>",
        "<p>shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines</p>\n<p>rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the</p>\n<p>ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange</p>\n<p>thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I</p>\n<p>exclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock</p>\n<p>me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as</p>\n<p>nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”</p>",
        "<p>These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you</p>\n<p>how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I</p>\n<p>listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its</p>\n<p>way to consume me.</p>\n<p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no</p>\n<p>rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could</p>\n<p>give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a</p>",
        "<p>mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.</p>\n<p>Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the</p>\n<p>family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I</p>\n<p>answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed</p>\n<p>under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if</p>\n<p>never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I</p>\n<p>loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate</p>",
        "<p>myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation</p>\n<p>made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,</p>\n<p>and that thought only had to me the reality of life.</p>"

        "<h3>Chapter 18</h3>\n<p>Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and</p>\n<p>I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the</p>\n<p>vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my</p>\n<p>repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not</p>\n<p>compose a female without again devoting several months to profound</p>\n<p>study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries</p>",
        "<p>having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was</p>\n<p>material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my</p>\n<p>father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to</p>\n<p>every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an</p>\n<p>undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to</p>\n<p>me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had</p>\n<p>hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when</p>",
        "<p>unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My</p>\n<p>father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts</p>\n<p>towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,</p>\n<p>which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring</p>\n<p>blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took</p>\n<p>refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake</p>\n<p>alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the</p>",
        "<p>rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and</p>\n<p>bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and</p>\n<p>on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile</p>\n<p>and a more cheerful heart.</p>\n<p>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,</p>\n<p>calling me aside, thus addressed me,</p>\n<p>“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former</p>",
        "<p>pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still</p>\n<p>unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in</p>\n<p>conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,</p>\n<p>and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a</p>\n<p>point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”</p>\n<p>I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—</p>\n<p>“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your</p>",
        "<p>marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the</p>\n<p>stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your</p>\n<p>earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and</p>\n<p>tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of</p>\n<p>man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have</p>\n<p>entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any</p>\n<p>wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another</p>",
        "<p>whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to</p>\n<p>Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear</p>\n<p>to feel.”</p>\n<p>“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and</p>\n<p>sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my</p>\n<p>warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are</p>\n<p>entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”</p>",
        "<p>“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,</p>\n<p>gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you</p>\n<p>feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast</p>\n<p>a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so</p>\n<p>strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,</p>\n<p>therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the</p>\n<p>marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us</p>",
        "<p>from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You</p>\n<p>are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent</p>\n<p>fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future</p>\n<p>plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,</p>\n<p>however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on</p>\n<p>your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words</p>\n<p>with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and</p>",
        "<p>sincerity.”</p>\n<p>I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable</p>\n<p>of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of</p>\n<p>thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me</p>\n<p>the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and</p>\n<p>dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled</p>\n<p>and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not</p>",
        "<p>impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival</p>\n<p>with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the</p>\n<p>ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with</p>\n<p>his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from</p>\n<p>which I expected peace.</p>\n<p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to</p>\n<p>England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers</p>",
        "<p>of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable</p>\n<p>use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining</p>\n<p>the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I</p>\n<p>had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my</p>\n<p>loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar</p>\n<p>intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful</p>\n<p>accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to</p>",
        "<p>thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I</p>\n<p>should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the</p>\n<p>harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my</p>\n<p>unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus</p>\n<p>employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be</p>\n<p>restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,</p>\n<p>the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some</p>",
        "<p>accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my</p>\n<p>slavery for ever.</p>\n<p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to</p>\n<p>visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I</p>\n<p>clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I</p>\n<p>urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to</p>\n<p>comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that</p>",
        "<p>resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find</p>\n<p>that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,</p>\n<p>and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my</p>\n<p>return, have restored me entirely to myself.</p>\n<p>The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or</p>\n<p>at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind</p>\n<p>precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without</p>",
        "<p>previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,</p>\n<p>arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered</p>\n<p>with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the</p>\n<p>commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be</p>\n<p>an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many</p>\n<p>hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between</p>\n<p>me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times</p>",
        "<p>force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to</p>\n<p>contemplate its progress?</p>\n<p>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union</p>\n<p>with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s</p>\n<p>age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one</p>\n<p>reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my</p>\n<p>unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,</p>",
        "<p>enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and</p>\n<p>forget the past in my union with her.</p>\n<p>I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me</p>\n<p>which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should</p>\n<p>leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and</p>\n<p>unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my</p>\n<p>departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and</p>",
        "<p>would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in</p>\n<p>itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.</p>\n<p>I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of</p>\n<p>this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the</p>\n<p>slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of</p>\n<p>the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend</p>\n<p>would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his</p>",
        "<p>machinations.</p>\n<p>It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native</p>\n<p>country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth</p>\n<p>therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of</p>\n<p>my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had</p>\n<p>been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man</p>\n<p>is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s</p>",
        "<p>sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand</p>\n<p>conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent</p>\n<p>farewell.</p>\n<p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly</p>\n<p>knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.</p>\n<p>I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on</p>\n<p>it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with</p>",
        "<p>me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful</p>\n<p>and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could</p>\n<p>only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy</p>\n<p>me whilst they endured.</p>\n<p>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed</p>\n<p>many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for</p>\n<p>Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He</p>",
        "<p>was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the</p>\n<p>setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new</p>\n<p>day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and</p>\n<p>the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;</p>\n<p>“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are</p>\n<p>you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy</p>\n<p>thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden</p>",
        "<p>sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more</p>\n<p>amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an</p>\n<p>eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a</p>\n<p>miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to</p>\n<p>enjoyment.</p>\n<p>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to</p>\n<p>Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this</p>",
        "<p>voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.</p>\n<p>We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from</p>\n<p>Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz</p>\n<p>becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds</p>\n<p>between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw</p>\n<p>many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by</p>\n<p>black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,</p>",
        "<p>presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view</p>\n<p>rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with</p>\n<p>the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,</p>\n<p>flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river</p>\n<p>and populous towns occupy the scene.</p>\n<p>We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers</p>\n<p>as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits</p>",
        "<p>continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the</p>\n<p>bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to</p>\n<p>drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these</p>\n<p>were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had</p>\n<p>been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by</p>\n<p>man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes</p>\n<p>of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the</p>",
        "<p>snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black</p>\n<p>and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance</p>\n<p>were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay</p>\n<p>appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore</p>\n<p>up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be</p>\n<p>on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,</p>\n<p>where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and</p>",
        "<p>where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the</p>\n<p>nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;</p>\n<p>but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The</p>\n<p>mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a</p>\n<p>charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.</p>\n<p>Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the</p>\n<p>island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now</p>",
        "<p>that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village</p>\n<p>half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits</p>\n<p>and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who</p>\n<p>pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of</p>\n<p>our own country.”</p>\n<p>Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and</p>\n<p>to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a</p>",
        "<p>being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and</p>\n<p>enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His</p>\n<p>soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that</p>\n<p>devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only</p>\n<p>in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to</p>\n<p>satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard</p>\n<p>only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—</p>",
        "<p>——The sounding cataract</p>\n<p>Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,</p>\n<p>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</p>\n<p>Their colours and their forms, were then to him</p>\n<p>An appetite; a feeling, and a love,</p>\n<p>That had no need of a remoter charm,</p>\n<p>By thought supplied, or any interest</p>",
        "<p>Unborrow’d from the eye.</p>\n<p>[Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]</p>\n<p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost</p>\n<p>for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful</p>\n<p>and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the</p>\n<p>life of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist</p>\n<p>in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and</p>",
        "<p>beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and</p>\n<p>consoles your unhappy friend.</p>\n<p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight</p>\n<p>tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,</p>\n<p>overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will</p>\n<p>proceed with my tale.</p>\n<p>Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to</p>",
        "<p>post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of</p>\n<p>the river was too gentle to aid us.</p>\n<p>Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we</p>\n<p>arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.</p>\n<p>It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw</p>\n<p>the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;</p>\n<p>they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the</p>",
        "<p>remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish</p>\n<p>Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard</p>\n<p>of even in my country.</p>\n<p>At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering</p>\n<p>above all, and the Tower famed in English history.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 19</h3>\n<p>London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several</p>\n<p>months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the</p>\n<p>intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this</p>\n<p>time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally</p>\n<p>occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the</p>\n<p>completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of</p>",
        "<p>introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most</p>\n<p>distinguished natural philosophers.</p>\n<p>If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,</p>\n<p>it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had</p>\n<p>come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of</p>\n<p>the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest</p>\n<p>was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I</p>",
        "<p>could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of</p>\n<p>Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory</p>\n<p>peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to</p>\n<p>my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my</p>\n<p>fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and</p>\n<p>Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled</p>\n<p>my soul with anguish.</p>",
        "<p>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive</p>\n<p>and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of</p>\n<p>manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of</p>\n<p>instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long</p>\n<p>had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had</p>\n<p>in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had</p>\n<p>taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of</p>",
        "<p>European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the</p>\n<p>execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his</p>\n<p>enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this</p>\n<p>as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures</p>\n<p>natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by</p>\n<p>any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,</p>\n<p>alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also</p>",
        "<p>began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this</p>\n<p>was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling</p>\n<p>on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme</p>\n<p>anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips</p>\n<p>to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.</p>\n<p>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in</p>\n<p>Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the</p>",
        "<p>beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient</p>\n<p>allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,</p>\n<p>where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,</p>\n<p>although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and</p>\n<p>all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.</p>\n<p>We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now</p>\n<p>February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the</p>",
        "<p>north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not</p>\n<p>intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,</p>\n<p>Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of</p>\n<p>this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and</p>\n<p>the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some</p>\n<p>obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.</p>\n<p>We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at</p>",
        "<p>Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us</p>\n<p>mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of</p>\n<p>stately deer were all novelties to us.</p>\n<p>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds</p>\n<p>were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted</p>\n<p>there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles</p>\n<p>I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,</p>",
        "<p>after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of</p>\n<p>Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his</p>\n<p>companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and</p>\n<p>son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they</p>\n<p>might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a</p>\n<p>dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these</p>\n<p>feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of</p>",
        "<p>the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.</p>\n<p>The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost</p>\n<p>magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows</p>\n<p>of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,</p>\n<p>which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and</p>\n<p>domes, embosomed among aged trees.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the</p>",
        "<p>memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed</p>\n<p>for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never</p>\n<p>visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what</p>\n<p>is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in</p>\n<p>the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate</p>\n<p>elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has</p>\n<p>entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what</p>",
        "<p>I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,</p>\n<p>pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.</p>\n<p>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs</p>\n<p>and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most</p>\n<p>animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery</p>\n<p>were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented</p>\n<p>themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the</p>",
        "<p>field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated</p>\n<p>from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas</p>\n<p>of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments</p>\n<p>and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains</p>\n<p>and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten</p>\n<p>into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my</p>\n<p>miserable self.</p>",
        "<p>We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next</p>\n<p>place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village</p>\n<p>resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but</p>\n<p>everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of</p>\n<p>distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my</p>\n<p>native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets</p>\n<p>of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same</p>",
        "<p>manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name</p>\n<p>made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit</p>\n<p>Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.</p>\n<p>From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in</p>\n<p>Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the</p>\n<p>Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the</p>\n<p>northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the</p>",
        "<p>rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we</p>\n<p>made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into</p>\n<p>happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than</p>\n<p>mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found</p>\n<p>in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have</p>\n<p>imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his</p>\n<p>inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among</p>",
        "<p>these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”</p>\n<p>But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain</p>\n<p>amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and</p>\n<p>when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit</p>\n<p>that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again</p>\n<p>engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.</p>\n<p>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland</p>",
        "<p>and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period</p>\n<p>of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them</p>\n<p>to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my</p>\n<p>promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s</p>\n<p>disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance</p>\n<p>on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment</p>\n<p>from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited</p>",
        "<p>for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was</p>\n<p>miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I</p>\n<p>saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to</p>\n<p>read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend</p>\n<p>followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.</p>\n<p>When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,</p>\n<p>but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of</p>",
        "<p>his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the</p>\n<p>consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed</p>\n<p>drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.</p>\n<p>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might</p>\n<p>have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well</p>\n<p>as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.</p>\n<p>But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic</p>",
        "<p>castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s</p>\n<p>Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for</p>\n<p>the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was</p>\n<p>impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.</p>\n<p>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and</p>\n<p>along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.</p>\n<p>But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into</p>",
        "<p>their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and</p>\n<p>accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland</p>\n<p>alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our</p>\n<p>rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with</p>\n<p>my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short</p>\n<p>time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more</p>\n<p>congenial to your own temper.”</p>",
        "<p>Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to</p>\n<p>remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with</p>\n<p>you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch</p>\n<p>people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,</p>\n<p>that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in</p>\n<p>your absence.”</p>\n<p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of</p>",
        "<p>Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the</p>\n<p>monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have</p>\n<p>finished, that he might receive his companion.</p>\n<p>With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of</p>\n<p>the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place</p>\n<p>fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were</p>\n<p>continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely</p>",
        "<p>affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its</p>\n<p>inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs</p>\n<p>gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they</p>\n<p>indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from</p>\n<p>the mainland, which was about five miles distant.</p>\n<p>On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of</p>\n<p>these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two</p>",
        "<p>rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable</p>\n<p>penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the</p>\n<p>door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some</p>\n<p>furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have</p>\n<p>occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been</p>\n<p>benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at</p>\n<p>and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes</p>",
        "<p>which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations</p>\n<p>of men.</p>\n<p>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,</p>\n<p>when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to</p>\n<p>listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a</p>\n<p>monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was</p>\n<p>far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills</p>",
        "<p>are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the</p>\n<p>plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when</p>\n<p>troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively</p>\n<p>infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.</p>\n<p>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but</p>\n<p>as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and</p>\n<p>irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my</p>",
        "<p>laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night</p>\n<p>in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in</p>\n<p>which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of</p>\n<p>enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my</p>\n<p>mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes</p>\n<p>were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in</p>\n<p>cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.</p>",
        "<p>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in</p>\n<p>a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from</p>\n<p>the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I</p>\n<p>grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my</p>\n<p>persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing</p>\n<p>to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much</p>\n<p>dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow</p>",
        "<p>creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.</p>\n<p>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably</p>\n<p>advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager</p>\n<p>hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was</p>\n<p>intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken</p>\n<p>in my bosom.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 20</h3>\n<p>I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just</p>\n<p>rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I</p>\n<p>remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my</p>\n<p>labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention</p>\n<p>to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to</p>\n<p>consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was</p>",
        "<p>engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled</p>\n<p>barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest</p>\n<p>remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was</p>\n<p>alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her</p>\n<p>mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had</p>\n<p>sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she</p>\n<p>had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and</p>",
        "<p>reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her</p>\n<p>creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived</p>\n<p>loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence</p>\n<p>for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn</p>\n<p>with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,</p>\n<p>and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being</p>\n<p>deserted by one of his own species.</p>",
        "<p>Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,</p>\n<p>yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon</p>\n<p>thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon</p>\n<p>the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a</p>\n<p>condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,</p>\n<p>to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved</p>\n<p>by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by</p>",
        "<p>his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my</p>\n<p>promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me</p>\n<p>as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at</p>\n<p>the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.</p>\n<p>I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by</p>\n<p>the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin</p>\n<p>wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task</p>",
        "<p>which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he</p>\n<p>had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide</p>\n<p>and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the</p>\n<p>fulfilment of my promise.</p>\n<p>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of</p>\n<p>malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my</p>\n<p>promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,</p>",
        "<p>tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me</p>\n<p>destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for</p>\n<p>happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.</p>\n<p>I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own</p>\n<p>heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I</p>\n<p>sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate</p>\n<p>the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most</p>",
        "<p>terrible reveries.</p>\n<p>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;</p>\n<p>it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature</p>\n<p>reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone</p>\n<p>specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound</p>\n<p>of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,</p>\n<p>although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear</p>",
        "<p>was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a</p>\n<p>person landed close to my house.</p>\n<p>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one</p>\n<p>endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a</p>\n<p>presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who</p>\n<p>dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation</p>\n<p>of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain</p>",
        "<p>endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.</p>\n<p>Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door</p>\n<p>opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he</p>\n<p>approached me and said in a smothered voice,</p>\n<p>“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you</p>\n<p>intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;</p>\n<p>I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among</p>",
        "<p>its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many</p>\n<p>months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have</p>\n<p>endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my</p>\n<p>hopes?”</p>\n<p>“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like</p>\n<p>yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”</p>\n<p>“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself</p>",
        "<p>unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe</p>\n<p>yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of</p>\n<p>day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;</p>\n<p>obey!”</p>\n<p>“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is</p>\n<p>arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but</p>\n<p>they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in</p>",
        "<p>vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose</p>\n<p>delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your</p>\n<p>words will only exasperate my rage.”</p>\n<p>The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the</p>\n<p>impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a</p>\n<p>wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had</p>\n<p>feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.</p>",
        "<p>Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,</p>\n<p>and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for</p>\n<p>ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my</p>\n<p>wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge</p>\n<p>remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but</p>\n<p>first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your</p>\n<p>misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with</p>",
        "<p>the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall</p>\n<p>repent of the injuries you inflict.”</p>\n<p>“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.</p>\n<p>I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend</p>\n<p>beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”</p>\n<p>“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your</p>\n<p>wedding-night.”</p>",
        "<p>I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my</p>\n<p>death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”</p>\n<p>I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with</p>\n<p>precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot</p>\n<p>across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the</p>\n<p>waves.</p>\n<p>All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to</p>",
        "<p>pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I</p>\n<p>walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination</p>\n<p>conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not</p>\n<p>followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him</p>\n<p>to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered</p>\n<p>to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.</p>\n<p>And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on</p>",
        "<p>your wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the</p>\n<p>fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and</p>\n<p>extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I</p>\n<p>thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she</p>\n<p>should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I</p>\n<p>had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall</p>\n<p>before my enemy without a bitter struggle.</p>",
        "<p>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became</p>\n<p>calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into</p>\n<p>the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last</p>\n<p>night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I</p>\n<p>almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow</p>\n<p>creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I</p>\n<p>desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,</p>",
        "<p>but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to</p>\n<p>be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a</p>\n<p>dæmon whom I had myself created.</p>\n<p>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it</p>\n<p>loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the</p>\n<p>sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep</p>\n<p>sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves</p>",
        "<p>were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep</p>\n<p>into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as</p>\n<p>if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to</p>\n<p>reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the</p>\n<p>words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared</p>\n<p>like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.</p>\n<p>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my</p>",
        "<p>appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a</p>\n<p>fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;</p>\n<p>it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to</p>\n<p>join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where</p>\n<p>he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired</p>\n<p>his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his</p>\n<p>Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as</p>",
        "<p>his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now</p>\n<p>conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of</p>\n<p>my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to</p>\n<p>leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed</p>\n<p>southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and</p>\n<p>I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.</p>\n<p>Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered</p>",
        "<p>to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I</p>\n<p>must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must</p>\n<p>handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next</p>\n<p>morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door</p>\n<p>of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had</p>\n<p>destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had</p>\n<p>mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and</p>",
        "<p>then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments</p>\n<p>out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my</p>\n<p>work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly</p>\n<p>put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them</p>\n<p>up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the</p>\n<p>meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my</p>\n<p>chemical apparatus.</p>",
        "<p>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place</p>\n<p>in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had</p>\n<p>before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with</p>\n<p>whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film</p>\n<p>had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw</p>\n<p>clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur</p>\n<p>to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not</p>",
        "<p>reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in</p>\n<p>my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made</p>\n<p>would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I</p>\n<p>banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different</p>\n<p>conclusion.</p>\n<p>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my</p>\n<p>basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.</p>",
        "<p>The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,</p>\n<p>but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a</p>\n<p>dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my</p>\n<p>fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was</p>\n<p>suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of</p>\n<p>darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound</p>\n<p>as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but</p>",
        "<p>the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then</p>\n<p>rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations</p>\n<p>that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a</p>\n<p>direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the</p>\n<p>moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its</p>\n<p>keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I</p>\n<p>slept soundly.</p>",
        "<p>I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I</p>\n<p>found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and</p>\n<p>the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found</p>\n<p>that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from</p>\n<p>which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found</p>\n<p>that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with</p>\n<p>water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I</p>",
        "<p>confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me</p>\n<p>and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the</p>\n<p>world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the</p>\n<p>wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in</p>\n<p>the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already</p>\n<p>been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to</p>\n<p>my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds</p>",
        "<p>that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the</p>\n<p>sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your</p>\n<p>task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and</p>\n<p>of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his</p>\n<p>sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so</p>\n<p>despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of</p>\n<p>closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.</p>",
        "<p>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the</p>\n<p>horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became</p>\n<p>free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick</p>\n<p>and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high</p>\n<p>land towards the south.</p>\n<p>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured</p>\n<p>for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of</p>",
        "<p>warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.</p>\n<p>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have</p>\n<p>of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a</p>\n<p>part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a</p>\n<p>wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived</p>\n<p>the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself</p>\n<p>suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I</p>",
        "<p>carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at</p>\n<p>length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of</p>\n<p>extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place</p>\n<p>where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with</p>\n<p>me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good</p>\n<p>harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected</p>\n<p>escape.</p>",
        "<p>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several</p>\n<p>people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my</p>\n<p>appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered</p>\n<p>together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me</p>\n<p>a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they</p>\n<p>spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My</p>\n<p>good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of</p>",
        "<p>this town and inform me where I am?”</p>\n<p>“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.</p>\n<p>“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,</p>\n<p>but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”</p>\n<p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a</p>\n<p>stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and</p>\n<p>angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so</p>",
        "<p>roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to</p>\n<p>receive strangers so inhospitably.”</p>\n<p>“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the</p>\n<p>English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”</p>\n<p>While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly</p>\n<p>increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which</p>\n<p>annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but</p>",
        "<p>no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the</p>\n<p>crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man</p>\n<p>approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must</p>\n<p>follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”</p>\n<p>“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not</p>\n<p>this a free country?”</p>\n<p>“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,</p>",
        "<p>and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was</p>\n<p>found murdered here last night.”</p>\n<p>This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;</p>\n<p>that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence</p>\n<p>and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from</p>\n<p>fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic</p>\n<p>to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into</p>",
        "<p>apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that</p>\n<p>was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair</p>\n<p>all fear of ignominy or death.</p>\n<p>I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of</p>\n<p>the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my</p>\n<p>recollection.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 21</h3>\n<p>I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old</p>\n<p>benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,</p>\n<p>with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,</p>\n<p>he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.</p>\n<p>About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the</p>\n<p>magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with</p>",
        "<p>his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,</p>\n<p>they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in</p>\n<p>for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did</p>\n<p>not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about</p>\n<p>two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,</p>\n<p>and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding</p>\n<p>along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his</p>",
        "<p>length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the</p>\n<p>light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,</p>\n<p>who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the</p>\n<p>corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the</p>\n<p>waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even</p>\n<p>that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage</p>\n<p>of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it</p>",
        "<p>to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty</p>\n<p>years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of</p>\n<p>any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.</p>\n<p>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but</p>\n<p>when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of</p>\n<p>my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a</p>\n<p>mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for</p>",
        "<p>support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew</p>\n<p>an unfavourable augury from my manner.</p>\n<p>The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was</p>\n<p>called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he</p>\n<p>saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;</p>\n<p>and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same</p>\n<p>boat in which I had just landed.</p>",
        "<p>A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door</p>\n<p>of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour</p>\n<p>before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with</p>\n<p>only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse</p>\n<p>was afterwards found.</p>\n<p>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the</p>\n<p>body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and</p>",
        "<p>rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was</p>\n<p>quite gone.</p>\n<p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed</p>\n<p>that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it</p>\n<p>was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been</p>\n<p>obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.</p>\n<p>Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body</p>",
        "<p>from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know</p>\n<p>the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance</p>\n<p>of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into</p>\n<p>the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what</p>\n<p>effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably</p>\n<p>suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the</p>",
        "<p>murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate</p>\n<p>and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the</p>\n<p>strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,</p>\n<p>knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had</p>\n<p>inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly</p>\n<p>tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.</p>\n<p>I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How</p>",
        "<p>can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with</p>\n<p>horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and</p>\n<p>agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,</p>\n<p>passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry</p>\n<p>Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on</p>\n<p>the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you</p>\n<p>also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other</p>",
        "<p>victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my</p>\n<p>benefactor—”</p>\n<p>The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and</p>\n<p>I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.</p>\n<p>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my</p>\n<p>ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the</p>\n<p>murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my</p>",
        "<p>attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was</p>\n<p>tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping</p>\n<p>my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke</p>\n<p>my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and</p>\n<p>bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.</p>\n<p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not</p>\n<p>sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming</p>",
        "<p>children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and</p>\n<p>youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the</p>\n<p>next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I</p>\n<p>made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of</p>\n<p>the wheel, continually renewed the torture?</p>\n<p>But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from</p>\n<p>a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by</p>",
        "<p>gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.</p>\n<p>It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had</p>\n<p>forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some</p>\n<p>great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around</p>\n<p>and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I</p>\n<p>was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.</p>\n<p>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside</p>",
        "<p>me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her</p>\n<p>countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise</p>\n<p>that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of</p>\n<p>persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her</p>\n<p>tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,</p>\n<p>and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.</p>\n<p>“Are you better now, sir?” said she.</p>",
        "<p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;</p>\n<p>but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am</p>\n<p>still alive to feel this misery and horror.”</p>\n<p>“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the</p>\n<p>gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you</p>\n<p>were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none</p>\n<p>of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty</p>",
        "<p>with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”</p>\n<p>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a</p>\n<p>speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt</p>\n<p>languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series</p>\n<p>of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it</p>\n<p>were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force</p>\n<p>of reality.</p>",
        "<p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew</p>\n<p>feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed</p>\n<p>me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The</p>\n<p>physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared</p>\n<p>them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the</p>\n<p>expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the</p>\n<p>second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the</p>",
        "<p>hangman who would gain his fee?</p>\n<p>These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had</p>\n<p>shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison</p>\n<p>to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who</p>\n<p>had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to</p>\n<p>see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of</p>\n<p>every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and</p>",
        "<p>miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see</p>\n<p>that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long</p>\n<p>intervals.</p>\n<p>One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes</p>\n<p>half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom</p>\n<p>and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to</p>\n<p>remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I</p>",
        "<p>considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the</p>\n<p>penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my</p>\n<p>thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.</p>\n<p>His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to</p>\n<p>mine and addressed me in French,</p>\n<p>“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to</p>\n<p>make you more comfortable?”</p>",
        "<p>“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole</p>\n<p>earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”</p>\n<p>“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to</p>\n<p>one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I</p>\n<p>hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can</p>\n<p>easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”</p>\n<p>“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become</p>",
        "<p>the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and</p>\n<p>have been, can death be any evil to me?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the</p>\n<p>strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some</p>\n<p>surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,</p>\n<p>seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was</p>\n<p>presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so</p>",
        "<p>unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across</p>\n<p>your path.”</p>\n<p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on</p>\n<p>this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at</p>\n<p>the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some</p>\n<p>astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened</p>\n<p>to say,</p>",
        "<p>“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on</p>\n<p>your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some</p>\n<p>trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune</p>\n<p>and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I</p>\n<p>discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote</p>\n<p>to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.</p>\n<p>But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any</p>",
        "<p>kind.”</p>\n<p>“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;</p>\n<p>tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am</p>\n<p>now to lament?”</p>\n<p>“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with</p>\n<p>gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”</p>\n<p>I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it</p>",
        "<p>instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my</p>\n<p>misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for</p>\n<p>me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,</p>\n<p>and cried out in agony,</p>\n<p>“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not</p>\n<p>let him enter!”</p>\n<p>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help</p>",
        "<p>regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in</p>\n<p>rather a severe tone,</p>\n<p>“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father</p>\n<p>would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”</p>\n<p>“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed</p>\n<p>from anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how</p>\n<p>very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”</p>",
        "<p>My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he</p>\n<p>thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,</p>\n<p>and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and</p>\n<p>quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.</p>\n<p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the</p>\n<p>arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,</p>\n<p>“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”</p>",
        "<p>My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by</p>\n<p>dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my</p>\n<p>desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of</p>\n<p>cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”</p>\n<p>said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance</p>\n<p>of the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems</p>\n<p>to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”</p>",
        "<p>The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too</p>\n<p>great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.</p>\n<p>“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the</p>\n<p>most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I</p>\n<p>should have died on the coffin of Henry.”</p>\n<p>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the</p>\n<p>precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that</p>",
        "<p>could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my</p>\n<p>strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the</p>\n<p>appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I</p>\n<p>gradually recovered my health.</p>\n<p>As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black</p>\n<p>melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was</p>\n<p>for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation</p>",
        "<p>into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous</p>\n<p>relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a</p>\n<p>life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now</p>\n<p>drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these</p>\n<p>throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears</p>\n<p>me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also</p>\n<p>sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the</p>",
        "<p>wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours</p>\n<p>motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that</p>\n<p>might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.</p>\n<p>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months</p>\n<p>in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a</p>\n<p>relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country</p>\n<p>town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every</p>",
        "<p>care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared</p>\n<p>the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not</p>\n<p>brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand</p>\n<p>jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney</p>\n<p>Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight</p>\n<p>after my removal I was liberated from prison.</p>\n<p>My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a</p>",
        "<p>criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh</p>\n<p>atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not</p>\n<p>participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a</p>\n<p>palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and</p>\n<p>although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I</p>\n<p>saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by</p>\n<p>no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes</p>",
        "<p>they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark</p>\n<p>orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed</p>\n<p>them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I</p>\n<p>first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.</p>\n<p>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked</p>\n<p>of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but</p>\n<p>these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a</p>",
        "<p>wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved</p>\n<p>cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more</p>\n<p>the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early</p>\n<p>childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a</p>\n<p>prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and</p>\n<p>these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and</p>\n<p>despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the</p>",
        "<p>existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance</p>\n<p>to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.</p>\n<p>Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally</p>\n<p>triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should</p>\n<p>return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those</p>\n<p>I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any</p>\n<p>chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to</p>",
        "<p>blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to</p>\n<p>the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the</p>\n<p>mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to</p>\n<p>delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a</p>\n<p>journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My</p>\n<p>strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day</p>\n<p>preyed upon my wasted frame.</p>",
        "<p>Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,</p>\n<p>my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel</p>\n<p>bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.</p>\n<p>It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to</p>\n<p>the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my</p>\n<p>sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should</p>\n<p>soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;</p>",
        "<p>yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested</p>\n<p>shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly</p>\n<p>that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest</p>\n<p>companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I</p>\n<p>repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing</p>\n<p>with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for</p>\n<p>Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on</p>",
        "<p>to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in</p>\n<p>which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a</p>\n<p>thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.</p>\n<p>Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking</p>\n<p>every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug</p>\n<p>only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of</p>\n<p>life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now</p>",
        "<p>swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did</p>\n<p>not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a</p>\n<p>thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind</p>\n<p>of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free</p>\n<p>myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was</p>\n<p>watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves</p>\n<p>were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of</p>",
        "<p>security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour</p>\n<p>and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm</p>\n<p>forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly</p>\n<p>susceptible.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 22</h3>\n<p>The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon</p>\n<p>found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I</p>\n<p>could continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were</p>\n<p>indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and</p>\n<p>sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to</p>\n<p>seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not</p>",
        "<p>abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt</p>\n<p>attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an</p>\n<p>angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right</p>\n<p>to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose</p>\n<p>joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they</p>\n<p>would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know</p>\n<p>my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!</p>",
        "<p>My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by</p>\n<p>various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I</p>\n<p>felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of</p>\n<p>murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.</p>\n<p>“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me.</p>\n<p>Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such</p>\n<p>a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent</p>",
        "<p>as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause</p>\n<p>of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all</p>\n<p>died by my hands.”</p>\n<p>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same</p>\n<p>assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an</p>\n<p>explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of</p>\n<p>delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented</p>",
        "<p>itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my</p>\n<p>convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence</p>\n<p>concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be</p>\n<p>supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,</p>\n<p>besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my</p>\n<p>hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of</p>\n<p>his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was</p>",
        "<p>silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.</p>\n<p>Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably</p>\n<p>from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part</p>\n<p>relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.</p>\n<p>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,</p>\n<p>“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat</p>\n<p>you never to make such an assertion again.”</p>",
        "<p>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who</p>\n<p>have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the</p>\n<p>assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.</p>\n<p>A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have</p>\n<p>saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not</p>\n<p>sacrifice the whole human race.”</p>\n<p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were</p>",
        "<p>deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and</p>\n<p>endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as</p>\n<p>possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in</p>\n<p>Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my</p>\n<p>misfortunes.</p>\n<p>As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my</p>\n<p>heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own</p>",
        "<p>crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost</p>\n<p>self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which</p>\n<p>sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners</p>\n<p>were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey</p>\n<p>to the sea of ice.</p>\n<p>A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the</p>\n<p>following letter from Elizabeth:</p>",
        "<p>“My dear Friend,</p>\n<p>“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle</p>\n<p>dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may</p>\n<p>hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you</p>\n<p>must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than</p>\n<p>when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,</p>\n<p>tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in</p>",
        "<p>your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of</p>\n<p>comfort and tranquillity.</p>\n<p>“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable</p>\n<p>a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at</p>\n<p>this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a</p>\n<p>conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders</p>\n<p>some explanation necessary before we meet.</p>",
        "<p>Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If</p>\n<p>you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.</p>\n<p>But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet</p>\n<p>be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the</p>\n<p>case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I</p>\n<p>have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.</p>\n<p>“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of</p>",
        "<p>your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and</p>\n<p>taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take</p>\n<p>place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I</p>\n<p>believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But</p>\n<p>as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each</p>\n<p>other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our</p>\n<p>case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual</p>",
        "<p>happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?</p>\n<p>“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at</p>\n<p>Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last</p>\n<p>autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every</p>\n<p>creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our</p>\n<p>connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of</p>\n<p>your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.</p>",
        "<p>But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love</p>\n<p>you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant</p>\n<p>friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my</p>\n<p>own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally</p>\n<p>miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now</p>\n<p>I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest</p>\n<p>misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that</p>",
        "<p>love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who</p>\n<p>have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries</p>\n<p>tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured</p>\n<p>that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be</p>\n<p>made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you</p>\n<p>obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth</p>\n<p>will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.</p>",
        "<p>“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the</p>\n<p>next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle</p>\n<p>will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your</p>\n<p>lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I</p>\n<p>shall need no other happiness.</p>\n<p>“Elizabeth Lavenza.</p>\n<p>“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”</p>",
        "<p>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of</p>\n<p>the fiend—“_I will be with you on your</p>\n<p>wedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the</p>\n<p>dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of</p>\n<p>happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he</p>\n<p>had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a</p>\n<p>deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were</p>",
        "<p>victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he</p>\n<p>were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the</p>\n<p>peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his</p>\n<p>cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,</p>\n<p>penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my</p>\n<p>Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of</p>\n<p>remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.</p>",
        "<p>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some</p>\n<p>softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal</p>\n<p>dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the</p>\n<p>angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make</p>\n<p>her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,</p>\n<p>again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My</p>\n<p>destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer</p>",
        "<p>should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would</p>\n<p>surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed</p>\n<p>_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that</p>\n<p>threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that</p>\n<p>he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately</p>\n<p>after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my</p>\n<p>immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my</p>",
        "<p>father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life</p>\n<p>should not retard it a single hour.</p>\n<p>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and</p>\n<p>affectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness</p>\n<p>remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in</p>\n<p>you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life</p>\n<p>and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a</p>",
        "<p>dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with</p>\n<p>horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only</p>\n<p>wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of</p>\n<p>misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,</p>\n<p>for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But</p>\n<p>until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most</p>\n<p>earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”</p>",
        "<p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned</p>\n<p>to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were</p>\n<p>in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a</p>\n<p>change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly</p>\n<p>vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of</p>\n<p>compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I</p>\n<p>was.</p>",
        "<p>The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness</p>\n<p>with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed</p>\n<p>me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and</p>\n<p>despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,</p>\n<p>bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice</p>\n<p>would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human</p>",
        "<p>feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason</p>\n<p>returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with</p>\n<p>resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the</p>\n<p>guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is</p>\n<p>otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.</p>\n<p>Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with</p>\n<p>Elizabeth. I remained silent.</p>",
        "<p>“Have you, then, some other attachment?”</p>\n<p>“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with</p>\n<p>delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate</p>\n<p>myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”</p>\n<p>“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen</p>\n<p>us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love</p>\n<p>for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be</p>",
        "<p>small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.</p>\n<p>And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of</p>\n<p>care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly</p>\n<p>deprived.”</p>\n<p>Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the</p>\n<p>threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had</p>\n<p>yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as</p>",
        "<p>invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with</p>\n<p>you on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as</p>\n<p>unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were</p>\n<p>balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful</p>\n<p>countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the</p>\n<p>ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,</p>\n<p>the seal to my fate.</p>",
        "<p>Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish</p>\n<p>intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself</p>\n<p>for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over</p>\n<p>the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if</p>\n<p>possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real</p>\n<p>intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I</p>\n<p>hastened that of a far dearer victim.</p>",
        "<p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or</p>\n<p>a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my</p>\n<p>feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the</p>\n<p>countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer</p>\n<p>eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,</p>\n<p>not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,</p>\n<p>that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate</p>",
        "<p>into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.</p>\n<p>Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,</p>\n<p>and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own</p>\n<p>heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness</p>\n<p>into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the</p>\n<p>decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of</p>\n<p>the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian</p>",
        "<p>government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It</p>\n<p>was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa</p>\n<p>Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake</p>\n<p>near which it stood.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the</p>\n<p>fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger</p>\n<p>constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and</p>",
        "<p>by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the</p>\n<p>period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be</p>\n<p>regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for</p>\n<p>in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed</p>\n<p>for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of</p>\n<p>as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to</p>",
        "<p>calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my</p>\n<p>destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;</p>\n<p>and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had</p>\n<p>promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the</p>\n<p>meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in</p>\n<p>the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.</p>\n<p>After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my</p>",
        "<p>father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our</p>\n<p>journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our</p>\n<p>voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;</p>\n<p>all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.</p>\n<p>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the</p>\n<p>feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we</p>\n<p>were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the</p>",
        "<p>beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw</p>\n<p>Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,</p>\n<p>surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy</p>\n<p>mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the</p>\n<p>opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the</p>\n<p>ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost</p>\n<p>insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.</p>",
        "<p>I took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If</p>\n<p>you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would</p>\n<p>endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this</p>\n<p>one day at least permits me to enjoy.”</p>\n<p>“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,</p>\n<p>nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not</p>\n<p>painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me</p>",
        "<p>not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I</p>\n<p>will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move</p>\n<p>along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise</p>\n<p>above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more</p>\n<p>interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in</p>\n<p>the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at</p>\n<p>the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature</p>",
        "<p>appears!”</p>\n<p>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all</p>\n<p>reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;</p>\n<p>joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place</p>\n<p>to distraction and reverie.</p>\n<p>The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and</p>\n<p>observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the</p>",
        "<p>lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached</p>\n<p>the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The</p>\n<p>spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range</p>\n<p>of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.</p>\n<p>The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,</p>\n<p>sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water</p>\n<p>and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the</p>",
        "<p>shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and</p>\n<p>hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched</p>\n<p>the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp</p>\n<p>me and cling to me for ever.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 23</h3>\n<p>It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the</p>\n<p>shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and</p>\n<p>contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured</p>\n<p>in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.</p>\n<p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence</p>\n<p>in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was</p>",
        "<p>beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the</p>\n<p>flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the</p>\n<p>scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves</p>\n<p>that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.</p>\n<p>I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the</p>\n<p>shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious</p>\n<p>and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in</p>",
        "<p>my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my</p>\n<p>life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that</p>\n<p>of my adversary was extinguished.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,</p>\n<p>but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and</p>\n<p>trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?</p>\n<p>What is it you fear?”</p>",
        "<p>“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and</p>\n<p>all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”</p>\n<p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how</p>\n<p>fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,</p>\n<p>and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her</p>\n<p>until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.</p>\n<p>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages</p>",
        "<p>of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to</p>\n<p>my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to</p>\n<p>conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the</p>\n<p>execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful</p>\n<p>scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I</p>\n<p>heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the</p>\n<p>motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood</p>",
        "<p>trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This</p>\n<p>state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed</p>\n<p>into the room.</p>\n<p>Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the</p>\n<p>destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was</p>\n<p>there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down</p>\n<p>and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I</p>",
        "<p>turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung</p>\n<p>by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!</p>\n<p>Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment</p>\n<p>only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.</p>\n<p>When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their</p>\n<p>countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others</p>\n<p>appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I</p>",
        "<p>escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my</p>\n<p>wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the</p>\n<p>posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon</p>\n<p>her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have</p>\n<p>supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but</p>\n<p>the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held</p>\n<p>in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.</p>",
        "<p>The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the</p>\n<p>breath had ceased to issue from her lips.</p>\n<p>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.</p>\n<p>The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of</p>\n<p>panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.</p>\n<p>The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be</p>\n<p>described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.</p>",
        "<p>A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his</p>\n<p>fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards</p>\n<p>the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,</p>\n<p>leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,</p>\n<p>plunged into the lake.</p>\n<p>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to</p>\n<p>the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with</p>",
        "<p>boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we</p>\n<p>returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a</p>\n<p>form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to</p>\n<p>search the country, parties going in different directions among the</p>\n<p>woods and vines.</p>\n<p>I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the</p>\n<p>house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken</p>",
        "<p>man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my</p>\n<p>eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I</p>\n<p>was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had</p>\n<p>happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that</p>\n<p>I had lost.</p>\n<p>After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room</p>\n<p>where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I</p>",
        "<p>hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no</p>\n<p>distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to</p>\n<p>various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their</p>\n<p>cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death</p>\n<p>of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly</p>\n<p>of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining</p>\n<p>friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now</p>",
        "<p>might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his</p>\n<p>feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started</p>\n<p>up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.</p>\n<p>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the</p>\n<p>wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was</p>\n<p>hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men</p>\n<p>to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from</p>",
        "<p>mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,</p>\n<p>and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any</p>\n<p>exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way</p>\n<p>to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were</p>\n<p>familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day</p>\n<p>before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.</p>\n<p>Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw</p>",
        "<p>the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had</p>\n<p>then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as</p>\n<p>a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,</p>\n<p>but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had</p>\n<p>snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been</p>\n<p>so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of</p>\n<p>man.</p>",
        "<p>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last</p>\n<p>overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their</p>\n<p>_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know</p>\n<p>that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My</p>\n<p>own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of</p>\n<p>my hideous narration.</p>\n<p>I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk</p>",
        "<p>under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old</p>\n<p>man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their</p>\n<p>delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with</p>\n<p>all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having</p>\n<p>few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed</p>\n<p>be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste</p>\n<p>in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated</p>",
        "<p>around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to</p>\n<p>rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.</p>\n<p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and</p>\n<p>darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,</p>\n<p>indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales</p>\n<p>with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a</p>\n<p>dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear</p>",
        "<p>conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my</p>\n<p>prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I</p>\n<p>understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>\n<p>Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I</p>\n<p>awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the</p>\n<p>memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their</p>\n<p>cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had</p>",
        "<p>sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a</p>\n<p>maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed</p>\n<p>that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal</p>\n<p>revenge on his cursed head.</p>\n<p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to</p>\n<p>reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about</p>\n<p>a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town</p>",
        "<p>and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the</p>\n<p>destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole</p>\n<p>authority for the apprehension of the murderer.</p>\n<p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be</p>\n<p>assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall</p>\n<p>be spared to discover the villain.”</p>\n<p>“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the</p>",
        "<p>deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I</p>\n<p>should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth</p>\n<p>which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to</p>\n<p>be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My</p>\n<p>manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my</p>\n<p>own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose</p>\n<p>quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related</p>",
        "<p>my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with</p>\n<p>accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.</p>\n<p>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued</p>\n<p>he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with</p>\n<p>horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted</p>\n<p>on his countenance.</p>\n<p>When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I</p>",
        "<p>accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your</p>\n<p>whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that</p>\n<p>your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those</p>\n<p>functions on this occasion.”</p>\n<p>This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own</p>\n<p>auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given</p>\n<p>to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon</p>",
        "<p>to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity</p>\n<p>returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you</p>\n<p>every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to</p>\n<p>have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an</p>\n<p>animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where</p>\n<p>no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since</p>\n<p>the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he</p>",
        "<p>has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”</p>\n<p>“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if</p>\n<p>he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois</p>\n<p>and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not</p>\n<p>credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the</p>\n<p>punishment which is his desert.”</p>\n<p>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.</p>",
        "<p>“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if</p>\n<p>it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer</p>\n<p>punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have</p>\n<p>yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove</p>\n<p>impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should</p>\n<p>make up your mind to disappointment.”</p>\n<p>“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My</p>",
        "<p>revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I</p>\n<p>confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage</p>\n<p>is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned</p>\n<p>loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have</p>\n<p>but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to</p>\n<p>his destruction.”</p>\n<p>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy</p>",
        "<p>in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness</p>\n<p>which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan</p>\n<p>magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of</p>\n<p>devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of</p>\n<p>madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and</p>\n<p>reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.</p>\n<p>“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of</p>",
        "<p>wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”</p>\n<p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on</p>\n<p>some other mode of action.</p>",
        "<h3>Chapter 24</h3>\n<p>My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was</p>\n<p>swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone</p>\n<p>endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and</p>\n<p>allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise</p>\n<p>delirium or death would have been my portion.</p>\n<p>My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I</p>",
        "<p>was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became</p>\n<p>hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels</p>\n<p>which had belonged to my mother, and departed.</p>\n<p>And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have</p>\n<p>traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships</p>\n<p>which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I</p>\n<p>have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon</p>",
        "<p>the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared</p>\n<p>not die and leave my adversary in being.</p>\n<p>When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I</p>\n<p>might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,</p>\n<p>and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain</p>\n<p>what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the</p>\n<p>entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father</p>",
        "<p>reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their</p>\n<p>graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which</p>\n<p>were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the</p>\n<p>scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested</p>\n<p>observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to</p>\n<p>cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the</p>\n<p>mourner.</p>",
        "<p>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to</p>\n<p>rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,</p>\n<p>and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass</p>\n<p>and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the</p>\n<p>sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the</p>\n<p>deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the</p>\n<p>spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,</p>",
        "<p>until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will</p>\n<p>preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun</p>\n<p>and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my</p>\n<p>eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering</p>\n<p>ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed</p>\n<p>and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now</p>\n<p>torments me.”</p>",
        "<p>I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me</p>\n<p>that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but</p>\n<p>the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.</p>\n<p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish</p>\n<p>laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed</p>\n<p>it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.</p>\n<p>Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have</p>",
        "<p>destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I</p>\n<p>was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known</p>\n<p>and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an</p>\n<p>audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have</p>\n<p>determined to live, and I am satisfied.”</p>\n<p>I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil</p>\n<p>eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone</p>",
        "<p>full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than</p>\n<p>mortal speed.</p>\n<p>I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a</p>\n<p>slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The</p>\n<p>blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend</p>\n<p>enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I</p>\n<p>took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.</p>",
        "<p>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I</p>\n<p>have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by</p>\n<p>this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,</p>\n<p>who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,</p>\n<p>left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw</p>\n<p>the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering</p>\n<p>on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand</p>",
        "<p>what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the</p>\n<p>least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil</p>\n<p>and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good</p>\n<p>followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly</p>\n<p>extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,</p>\n<p>when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast</p>\n<p>was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The</p>",
        "<p>fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but</p>\n<p>I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had</p>\n<p>invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and</p>\n<p>I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the</p>\n<p>few drops that revived me, and vanish.</p>\n<p>I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon</p>\n<p>generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the</p>",
        "<p>country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom</p>\n<p>seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my</p>\n<p>path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers</p>\n<p>by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,</p>\n<p>which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had</p>\n<p>provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.</p>\n<p>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during</p>",
        "<p>sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most</p>\n<p>miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The</p>\n<p>spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of</p>\n<p>happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of</p>\n<p>this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was</p>\n<p>sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my</p>\n<p>friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent</p>",
        "<p>countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s</p>\n<p>voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by</p>\n<p>a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should</p>\n<p>come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest</p>\n<p>friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to</p>\n<p>their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and</p>\n<p>persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that</p>",
        "<p>burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the</p>\n<p>destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the</p>\n<p>mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the</p>\n<p>ardent desire of my soul.</p>\n<p>What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he</p>\n<p>left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided</p>\n<p>me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet</p>",
        "<p>over”—these words were legible in one of these</p>\n<p>inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I</p>\n<p>seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of</p>\n<p>cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if</p>\n<p>you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my</p>\n<p>enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable</p>\n<p>hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”</p>",
        "<p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,</p>\n<p>miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search</p>\n<p>until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my</p>\n<p>Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the</p>\n<p>reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!</p>\n<p>As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the</p>\n<p>cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were</p>",
        "<p>shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to</p>\n<p>seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to</p>\n<p>seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be</p>\n<p>procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.</p>\n<p>The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One</p>\n<p>inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils</p>\n<p>only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter</p>",
        "<p>upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting</p>\n<p>hatred.”</p>\n<p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I</p>\n<p>resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support</p>\n<p>me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,</p>\n<p>until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary</p>\n<p>of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the</p>",
        "<p>south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by</p>\n<p>its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when</p>\n<p>they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with</p>\n<p>rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down</p>\n<p>and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in</p>\n<p>safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,</p>\n<p>to meet and grapple with him.</p>",
        "<p>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus</p>\n<p>traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the</p>\n<p>fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had</p>\n<p>daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that</p>\n<p>when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and</p>\n<p>I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new</p>\n<p>courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched</p>",
        "<p>hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the</p>\n<p>fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,</p>\n<p>had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,</p>\n<p>putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of</p>\n<p>his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter</p>\n<p>food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a</p>\n<p>numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same</p>",
        "<p>night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his</p>\n<p>journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they</p>\n<p>conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the</p>\n<p>ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.</p>\n<p>On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.</p>\n<p>He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless</p>\n<p>journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few</p>",
        "<p>of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a</p>\n<p>genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea</p>\n<p>that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance</p>\n<p>returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.</p>\n<p>After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered</p>\n<p>round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.</p>\n<p>I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of</p>",
        "<p>the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I</p>\n<p>departed from land.</p>\n<p>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured</p>\n<p>misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution</p>\n<p>burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and</p>\n<p>rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard</p>\n<p>the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But</p>",
        "<p>again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.</p>\n<p>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that</p>\n<p>I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction</p>\n<p>of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of</p>\n<p>despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured</p>\n<p>her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after</p>\n<p>the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the</p>",
        "<p>summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,</p>\n<p>died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye</p>\n<p>caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to</p>\n<p>discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I</p>\n<p>distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known</p>\n<p>form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!</p>\n<p>Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might</p>",
        "<p>not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was</p>\n<p>dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that</p>\n<p>oppressed me, I wept aloud.</p>\n<p>But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their</p>\n<p>dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an</p>\n<p>hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly</p>\n<p>irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor</p>",
        "<p>did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short</p>\n<p>time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed</p>\n<p>perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I</p>\n<p>beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within</p>\n<p>me.</p>\n<p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were</p>\n<p>suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had</p>",
        "<p>ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as</p>\n<p>the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous</p>\n<p>and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;</p>\n<p>and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a</p>\n<p>tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few</p>\n<p>minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left</p>\n<p>drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and</p>",
        "<p>thus preparing for me a hideous death.</p>\n<p>In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I</p>\n<p>myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your</p>\n<p>vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.</p>\n<p>I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded</p>\n<p>at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and</p>\n<p>by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in</p>",
        "<p>the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,</p>\n<p>still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my</p>\n<p>purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue</p>\n<p>my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my</p>\n<p>vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied</p>\n<p>hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.</p>\n<p>Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow</p>",
        "<p>me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,</p>\n<p>swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him</p>\n<p>and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to</p>\n<p>undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?</p>\n<p>No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if</p>\n<p>the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he</p>\n<p>shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated</p>",
        "<p>woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent</p>\n<p>and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but</p>\n<p>trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery</p>\n<p>and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,</p>\n<p>Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and</p>\n<p>thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the</p>\n<p>steel aright.</p>",
        "<p>Walton, _in continuation._</p>\n<p>August 26th, 17—.</p>\n<p>You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not</p>\n<p>feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles</p>\n<p>mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his</p>\n<p>tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with</p>\n<p>difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes</p>",
        "<p>were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow</p>\n<p>and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his</p>\n<p>countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a</p>\n<p>tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a</p>\n<p>volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression</p>\n<p>of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.</p>\n<p>His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,</p>",
        "<p>yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,</p>\n<p>and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a</p>\n<p>greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,</p>\n<p>however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!</p>\n<p>I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I</p>\n<p>endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his</p>\n<p>creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.</p>",
        "<p>“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your</p>\n<p>senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the</p>\n<p>world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek</p>\n<p>to increase your own.”</p>\n<p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked</p>\n<p>to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,</p>\n<p>but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held</p>",
        "<p>with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said</p>\n<p>he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to</p>\n<p>posterity.”</p>\n<p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest</p>\n<p>tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my</p>\n<p>soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale</p>\n<p>and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe</p>",
        "<p>him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of</p>\n<p>every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can</p>\n<p>now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and</p>\n<p>death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and</p>\n<p>delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his</p>\n<p>friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or</p>\n<p>excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his</p>",
        "<p>fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a</p>\n<p>remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render</p>\n<p>them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.</p>\n<p>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and</p>\n<p>misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays</p>\n<p>unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His</p>\n<p>eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates</p>",
        "<p>a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,</p>\n<p>without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days</p>\n<p>of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems</p>\n<p>to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.</p>\n<p>“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for</p>\n<p>some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness</p>\n<p>of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of</p>",
        "<p>the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,</p>\n<p>for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that</p>\n<p>might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had</p>\n<p>completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational</p>\n<p>animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But</p>\n<p>this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now</p>\n<p>serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes</p>",
        "<p>are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am</p>\n<p>chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of</p>\n<p>analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I</p>\n<p>conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot</p>\n<p>recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod</p>\n<p>heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea</p>\n<p>of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty</p>",
        "<p>ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once</p>\n<p>was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency</p>\n<p>rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,</p>\n<p>never, never again to rise.”</p>\n<p>Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have</p>\n<p>sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert</p>\n<p>seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his</p>",
        "<p>value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.</p>\n<p>“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so</p>\n<p>miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh</p>\n<p>affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any</p>\n<p>man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even</p>\n<p>where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,</p>\n<p>the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our</p>",
        "<p>minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our</p>\n<p>infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,</p>\n<p>are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more</p>\n<p>certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a</p>\n<p>brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,</p>\n<p>suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,</p>\n<p>however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be</p>",
        "<p>contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only</p>\n<p>through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever</p>\n<p>I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of</p>\n<p>Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one</p>\n<p>feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I</p>\n<p>were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive</p>\n<p>utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But</p>",
        "<p>such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I</p>\n<p>gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”</p>\n<p>My beloved Sister,</p>\n<p>September 2d.</p>\n<p>I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever</p>\n<p>doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit</p>\n<p>it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and</p>",
        "<p>threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I</p>\n<p>have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have</p>\n<p>none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our</p>\n<p>situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is</p>\n<p>terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered</p>\n<p>through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.</p>\n<p>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my</p>",
        "<p>destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and</p>\n<p>you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My</p>\n<p>beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,</p>\n<p>in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband</p>\n<p>and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!</p>\n<p>My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He</p>\n<p>endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession</p>",
        "<p>which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have</p>\n<p>happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite</p>\n<p>of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel</p>\n<p>the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he</p>\n<p>rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these</p>\n<p>vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the</p>\n<p>resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of</p>",
        "<p>expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny</p>\n<p>caused by this despair.</p>\n<p>September 5th.</p>\n<p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is</p>\n<p>highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot</p>\n<p>forbear recording it.</p>\n<p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger</p>",
        "<p>of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of</p>\n<p>my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of</p>\n<p>desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire</p>\n<p>still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly</p>\n<p>roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent</p>\n<p>lifelessness.</p>\n<p>I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.</p>",
        "<p>This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his</p>\n<p>eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half</p>\n<p>a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They</p>\n<p>entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his</p>\n<p>companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation</p>\n<p>to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.</p>\n<p>We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they</p>",
        "<p>feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free</p>\n<p>passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and</p>\n<p>lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted</p>\n<p>this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn</p>\n<p>promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my</p>\n<p>course southwards.</p>\n<p>This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived</p>",
        "<p>the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in</p>\n<p>possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when</p>\n<p>Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly</p>\n<p>to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,</p>\n<p>and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,</p>\n<p>he said,</p>\n<p>“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,</p>",
        "<p>so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious</p>\n<p>expedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was</p>\n<p>smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and</p>\n<p>terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth</p>\n<p>and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and</p>\n<p>these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this</p>\n<p>was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the</p>",
        "<p>benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men</p>\n<p>who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,</p>\n<p>behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first</p>\n<p>mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content</p>\n<p>to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and</p>\n<p>peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm</p>\n<p>firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come</p>",
        "<p>thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove</p>\n<p>yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your</p>\n<p>purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your</p>\n<p>hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it</p>\n<p>shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace</p>\n<p>marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and</p>\n<p>who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”</p>",
        "<p>He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed</p>\n<p>in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can</p>\n<p>you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were</p>\n<p>unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had</p>\n<p>been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously</p>\n<p>desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage</p>\n<p>would return.</p>",
        "<p>They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and</p>\n<p>almost deprived of life.</p>\n<p>How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than</p>\n<p>return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my</p>\n<p>fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never</p>\n<p>willingly continue to endure their present hardships.</p>\n<p>September 7th.</p>",
        "<p>The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.</p>\n<p>Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back</p>\n<p>ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess</p>\n<p>to bear this injustice with patience.</p>\n<p>September 12th.</p>\n<p>It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility</p>\n<p>and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these</p>",
        "<p>bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted</p>\n<p>towards England and towards you, I will not despond.</p>\n<p>September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard</p>\n<p>at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were</p>\n<p>in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief</p>\n<p>attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in</p>\n<p>such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked</p>",
        "<p>behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from</p>\n<p>the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly</p>\n<p>free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native</p>\n<p>country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,</p>\n<p>loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the</p>\n<p>cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they</p>\n<p>will soon return to England.”</p>",
        "<p>“Do you, then, really return?”</p>\n<p>“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them</p>\n<p>unwillingly to danger, and I must return.”</p>\n<p>“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but</p>\n<p>mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but</p>\n<p>surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with</p>\n<p>sufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the</p>",
        "<p>bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.</p>\n<p>It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was</p>\n<p>entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with</p>\n<p>difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing</p>\n<p>draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he</p>\n<p>told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.</p>\n<p>His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat</p>",
        "<p>by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but</p>\n<p>presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,</p>\n<p>said, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall</p>\n<p>soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think</p>\n<p>not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning</p>\n<p>hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself</p>\n<p>justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I</p>",
        "<p>have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.</p>\n<p>In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was</p>\n<p>bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and</p>\n<p>well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to</p>\n<p>that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to</p>\n<p>my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or</p>\n<p>misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to</p>",
        "<p>create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity</p>\n<p>and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction</p>\n<p>beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I</p>\n<p>know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may</p>\n<p>render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was</p>\n<p>mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I</p>\n<p>asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,</p>",
        "<p>when I am only induced by reason and virtue.</p>\n<p>“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil</p>\n<p>this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have</p>\n<p>little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these</p>\n<p>points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I</p>\n<p>leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near</p>\n<p>approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I</p>",
        "<p>may still be misled by passion.</p>\n<p>“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in</p>\n<p>other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the</p>\n<p>only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of</p>\n<p>the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,</p>\n<p>Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it</p>\n<p>be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in</p>",
        "<p>science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been</p>\n<p>blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”</p>\n<p>His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his</p>\n<p>effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he</p>\n<p>attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and</p>\n<p>his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed</p>\n<p>away from his lips.</p>",
        "<p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this</p>\n<p>glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the</p>\n<p>depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and</p>\n<p>feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of</p>\n<p>disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find</p>\n<p>consolation.</p>\n<p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the</p>",
        "<p>breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there</p>\n<p>is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin</p>\n<p>where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.</p>\n<p>Good night, my sister.</p>\n<p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the</p>\n<p>remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail</p>\n<p>it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this</p>",
        "<p>final and wonderful catastrophe.</p>\n<p>I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable</p>\n<p>friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to</p>\n<p>describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its</p>\n<p>proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long</p>\n<p>locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and</p>\n<p>apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my</p>",
        "<p>approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung</p>\n<p>towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of</p>\n<p>such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and</p>\n<p>endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.</p>\n<p>I called on him to stay.</p>\n<p>He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the</p>\n<p>lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and</p>",
        "<p>every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some</p>\n<p>uncontrollable passion.</p>\n<p>“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my</p>\n<p>crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its</p>\n<p>close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it</p>\n<p>avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee</p>\n<p>by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer</p>",
        "<p>me.”</p>\n<p>His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to</p>\n<p>me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his</p>\n<p>enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I</p>\n<p>approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his</p>\n<p>face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I</p>\n<p>attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster</p>",
        "<p>continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I</p>\n<p>gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.</p>\n<p>“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you</p>\n<p>had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse</p>\n<p>before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,</p>\n<p>Frankenstein would yet have lived.”</p>\n<p>“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then</p>",
        "<p>dead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,</p>\n<p>“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the</p>\n<p>ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the</p>\n<p>lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me</p>\n<p>on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the</p>\n<p>groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be</p>\n<p>susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice</p>",
        "<p>and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without</p>\n<p>torture such as you cannot even imagine.</p>\n<p>“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken</p>\n<p>and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I</p>\n<p>abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of</p>\n<p>my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for</p>\n<p>happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me</p>",
        "<p>he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the</p>\n<p>indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter</p>\n<p>indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I</p>\n<p>recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I</p>\n<p>knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the</p>\n<p>slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not</p>\n<p>disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had</p>",
        "<p>cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my</p>\n<p>despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no</p>\n<p>choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly</p>\n<p>chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable</p>\n<p>passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”</p>\n<p>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called</p>\n<p>to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and</p>",
        "<p>persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my</p>\n<p>friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.</p>\n<p>“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you</p>\n<p>have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are</p>\n<p>consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!</p>\n<p>If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would</p>\n<p>he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you</p>",
        "<p>feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn</p>\n<p>from your power.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.</p>\n<p>“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to</p>\n<p>be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.</p>\n<p>No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of</p>\n<p>virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being</p>",
        "<p>overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has</p>\n<p>become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into</p>\n<p>bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am</p>\n<p>content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am</p>\n<p>well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once</p>\n<p>my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once</p>\n<p>I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would</p>",
        "<p>love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was</p>\n<p>nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has</p>\n<p>degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no</p>\n<p>malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the</p>\n<p>frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same</p>\n<p>creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent</p>\n<p>visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the</p>",
        "<p>fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man</p>\n<p>had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.</p>\n<p>“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my</p>\n<p>crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them</p>\n<p>he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured</p>\n<p>wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did</p>\n<p>not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still</p>",
        "<p>I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no</p>\n<p>injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all</p>\n<p>humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his</p>\n<p>friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic</p>\n<p>who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous</p>\n<p>and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an</p>\n<p>abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my</p>",
        "<p>blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.</p>\n<p>“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and</p>\n<p>the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to</p>\n<p>death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have</p>\n<p>devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and</p>\n<p>admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that</p>\n<p>irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but</p>",
        "<p>your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the</p>\n<p>hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the</p>\n<p>imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands</p>\n<p>will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.</p>\n<p>“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work</p>\n<p>is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to</p>\n<p>consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,</p>",
        "<p>but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this</p>\n<p>sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me</p>\n<p>thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall</p>\n<p>collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its</p>\n<p>remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would</p>\n<p>create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the</p>\n<p>agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet</p>",
        "<p>unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no</p>\n<p>more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no</p>\n<p>longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,</p>\n<p>feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my</p>\n<p>happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first</p>\n<p>opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the</p>\n<p>rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to</p>",
        "<p>me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by</p>\n<p>crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in</p>\n<p>death?</p>\n<p>“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these</p>\n<p>eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive</p>\n<p>and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better</p>\n<p>satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou</p>",
        "<p>didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;</p>\n<p>and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think</p>\n<p>and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than</p>\n<p>that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to</p>\n<p>thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my</p>\n<p>wounds until death shall close them for ever.</p>\n<p>“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I</p>",
        "<p>shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning</p>\n<p>miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and</p>\n<p>exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration</p>\n<p>will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit</p>\n<p>will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.</p>\n<p>Farewell.”</p>\n<p>He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft</p>",
        "<p>which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and</p>\n<p>lost in darkness and distance.</p>"
